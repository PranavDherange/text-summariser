{"tt0003419": ["One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism, the highly atmospheric style of film-making developed during the 20s in Berlin. Classic movies like \"Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari.\" (1920) and \"Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens\" (1922) were the most famous direct results of this movement, and while the movement didn't have a long life, its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today, specially in the horror genre. One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener, director of 1920's \"Der Golem, Wie Er in die Welt Kam\", as in his debut as a filmmaker, seven years before the making of that classic, he was already making experiments with expressionism in film. That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally, another horror film: \"Der Student Von Prag\".\"Der Student Von Prag\" (\"The Student of Prague\"), is the story of Balduin (Paul Wegener), a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague, but who always find himself with financial troubles. One day, Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit (Grete Berger) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident. Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again, but soon he discovers that he'll have to compete with her rich cousin, Graf Von Schwarzenberg (Lothar K\u00f6rner), who also wants to marry her. Knowing that he can't offer her much, Balduin wishes to be wealthy, and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli (John Gottowt) enters the scene. Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room. Balduin accepts the proposal, only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror.Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"William Wilson\" and the classic legend of \"Faust\", the story of \"Der Student Von Prag\" was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers, a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature. Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form, \"Der Student Von Prag\" shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes. Like most of the scriptwriters of his time, Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater, although \"Der Student Von Prag\" begins to move away from that style. While a bit poor on its character development (specially on the supporting characters), Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduin.While \"Der Student Von Prag\" was Paul Wegener's directorial debut and Stellan Rye's second film as a filmmaker, it's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly. Giving great use to Guido Seeber's cinematography, the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do. Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his \"Golem\" series from Seeber and Rye. Despite having very limited resources, Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing (for its time) visual effect for the scenes with Balduin's reflection (played by Wegener too). Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film, Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakers.As Balduin, Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie. It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer, but one can't deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract. John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove. Few is said about Scapinelli in the film, but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared. The rest of the main cast is less lucky, with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit, and Lothar K\u00f6rner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg. However, it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron Waldis-Schwarzenberg, showing the dignity that L\u00f6rner's character should have had.Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake (made 13 years after this film) is superior in every possible way, it's not difficult to understand why \"Der Student Von Prag\" hasn't stood the test of time as well as other early films. The movie's main problem is definitely its extremely low budget, as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers' story needed to be fully developed. This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times, or even incomplete, as if there was something missing in the narrative (of course, there's also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete). However, \"Der Student Von Prag\" is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that, while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time, left a powerful impression in history.As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement, it's hard to deny the enormous importance that \"Der Student Von Prag\" has in the history of German cinema, probably in the history of cinema in general. It may look dated even for its time, but considering the limited resources its director had, it's truly better than most films from that era. As the movie that started Paul Wegener's career, and with that German expressionism, \"Der Student Von Prag\" is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history. 7/10", "\"The Student of Prague\" is an early feature-length horror drama or, rather, it is an \"autorenfilm\" (i.e. an author's film). It's a piece of a movement of many movements that tried to lend cultural respectability to cinema, or just make a profit, by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it centers on a doppelg\u00e4nger theme.Unfortunately, the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make Paul Wegener appear twice within scenes. Guido Seeber was a special effects wizard for his day, but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. Film scholar Leon Hunt (printed in \"Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narrative\"), however, has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme: characters being split by left/right, near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots. Regardless, the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the lack of editing; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. None of this is unusual for 1913, but there were more advanced pictures in this respect around the same time, including the better parts of \"Atlantis\" (August Blom, 1913), \"Twilight of a Woman's Soul\" (Yevgeni Bauer, 1913) and the short films of D.W. Griffith.An expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a superior remake. Furthermore, the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character--other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here, the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. I know their world is silent to me, but I assume, with their lips moving and such, that their world would not be silent to them, so how can Lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed?Nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener, who seems to have been the primary mind behind it, in addition to playing the lead, would later play the title role and co-direct \"The Golem\" in 1920--helping to further inaugurate a dark, supernatural thread in German silent cinema.(Note: The first version I viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with faces bleached at times and such. I'm not sure who was the distributor. I've also since seen the Alpha DVD, which, at 41 minutes, is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards, but is visually not as bad. The repetitive score is best muted, though.)", "This early version of the tale 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, starring Paul Wegener (who was also in 'The Golem' a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95 year old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who makes a pact with him for gold - the gold he needs to woo a countess he's previously saved from drowning.Moving at a fast pace (the film runs just over an hour) and fairly well written and characterised, 'The Student of Prague' has echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, starting as it does with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, and developing into good and evil sides of the same person.", "I watched Alpha's DVD of this, which was only about forty-one minutes long. I don't know if it was missing scenes, or run at a faster speed, or what, to account for the difference from the running time IMDb has. As with Alpha's DVD of the remake, I didn't particularly care for the musical score they'd added. I think it's possible they also missed some of the intertitles; one of the other users mentions something Balduin says after his reflection is taken that wasn't in the copy I viewed.A renowned fencer asks a man named Scapinelli to procure him a winning lottery ticket, or a woman with a large dowry. The opening credits indicate Scapinelli is a sorcerer; he isn't used much in this film, and we don't know really anything about him when we first meet him, or what relationship Balduin has with him. In the remake, Balduin doesn't ask for those things, just wishes for a rich woman (not expecting the wish to come true), and Scapinelli promises to deliver.A rich woman who is riding horses with her fianc\u00e9 (also her first cousin) falls off her horse into a body of water, and Balduin saves her. In the remake, it's clear that Scapinelli guides her horse to Balduin and then causes the horse to act wildly, until Balduin scoops her off it. Here, it's unclear that Scapinelli had anything to do with it.There are many scenes here that are reproduced in the sequel. Possibly even some of the same camera shots are copied.The ending is not as powerful as the ending of the sequel. Still, this was interesting to watch and at the price of Alpha's DVDs, a bargain. Perhaps a better edition will come out sometime in the future.", "This film marks the beginning of the Golden Age of Silent Horror movies emanating from Germany, though its style is not yet what would come to be defined \"Expressionist\". I had watched it many years ago on Italian TV and remember liking it quite a bit though, in retrospect, it suffers in comparison with the superior 1926 remake (not least because that one is more than twice its length!); it's still well worth watching and remains full of interest today, also because it led directly to Paul Wegener's trademark role of The Golem in a famous trilogy, which unfortunately is almost impossible to re-evaluate today since only the third entry in the series seems to have survived! The accompanying synthesizer score on the Alpha DVD was quite unnerving in its relentless repetitiveness which, in hindsight, perfectly suited the doppelganger theme of the movie.", "A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman--so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense. An evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady's heart IF he agrees to give him anything he wants that's within their room. The dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man's reflection out of the mirror--and bad things naturally occur as a result.If this film had been made just a decade later, I am sure I wouldn't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film. After all, the film's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is, at times, a bit stilted. However, when you consider that in 1913 \"full-length\" films were rare--and often only 20 to 30 minutes long! Plus, the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual--as stories were very short and broadly acted. So, given the limitations of the time, this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known.", "Those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on. This is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently, tearing his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and, of course, the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit dull, but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie. Also, they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing. I first was made aware of this movie about 25 years ago and have finally been able to see it. I was not disappointed.", "If \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" is the father of all horror films (and of German expressionist cinema), this pre-WWI film is the grandfather. The titular student, starving in an empty garret, makes a deal with the Devil-- the Devil gives him a bottomless sack of gold, in exchange for \"anything in this room.\" The Devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror. He walks off with the student's doppelganger, who commits crimes for which the student is blamed.The film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking; the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects, but the film is, of necessity, virtually all shot in shadowless daylight. But the scene where the reflection walks out of the mirror still packs a wallop.More interesting for the trends it fortells than for its own sake, The Student of Prague is still worthwhile.", "While watching the 1926 version of THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE I noticed the earlier 1913 version was on there too so I thought I'd check it out. This is listed by some as the first feature-length horror movie ever made and in addition was the debut for director Paul Wegener, who went on to great success with DER GOLEM. For what it's worth I think the 1926 version is the much better bet as Conrad Veidt is a much stronger actor in the lead role than Wegener (who casts himself as Balduin) is here. Otherwise the two films are virtually identical plot-wise, although this 1913 version plays down the horror and atmosphere so that it seems tamer and less spooky than the later movie, particularly the climax that lacks the great stalking sequence that made the 1926 version so enjoyable for me. Certainly not bad if you're interested in the history of the genre, but superceded by what was to come.", "Student of Prague, The (1913)** 1/2 (out of 4)A poor college student (Paul Wegener) falls in love with a rich woman so he makes a deal with a sorcerer. The sorcerer pays him 100,000 gold pieces for anything in the student's room. The sorcerer decides to steal the student's soul. This is a pretty good horror film that manages to have a few very creepy scenes including the first scene where the soul is taken. The rest of the film is pretty weak working itself up towards the very good ending. This is still a very important film for horror fans to seek out.You can check my review of the remake here as well.", "A poor student (Paul Wegener) rescues a beautiful countess (Grete Berger) and soon becomes obsessed with her. A sorcerer (John Gottowt) makes a deal with the young man to give him fabulous wealth and anything he wants, if he will sign his name to a contract.The film is loosely based on \"William Wilson\", a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, the poem \"The December Night\" by Alfred de Musset, and Faust. The Faust elements are obvious, the other two less so (though the Musset quotation might give it away). This is really a great early example of horror literature on screen.Cinematographer Guido Seeber utilized groundbreaking camera tricks to create the effect of the Doppelg\u00e4nger (mirror double), producing a seamless double exposure. Hanns Heinz Ewers was a noted writer of horror and fantasy stories whose involvement with the screenplay lent a much needed air of respectability to the fledgling art form.", "This is definitely one one the best pre-WWI movies! Still, if you are looking for the typical German expressionism, you will not see a lot of this. The movie is great in its use of the Prague locations (remember- those were still the days of Austria-Hungary). You see some of the city sights and also the famous Jewish cemetery but not in a tourist fashion, it all serves the romantic atmosphere of the movie: romantic in the fashion of Hoffmann and the German doppelg\u00e4nger idea.\nPaul Wegener is far away from a modern day movie star, but he was one of the top German theater actors of the days. He fully embraced the concept of movies and even directed some. The author Hanns Heinz Ewers produced some dangerous Nazi books later on, but this one is a major achievement.", "Predating the German Expressionist movement in film (predating even World War I), this is the granddaddy of them all: the very first full-length horror movie. Being the first, we do not demand perfection from it; this film is as raw as William Burroughs's debut novel \"Junky\" or the first Stooges album, and suitably so. But the viewer will be pleasantly surprised that \"The Student of Prague\" still packs a punch after more than a century. From Paul Wegener's haunted, compelling performance as Balduin to the imposing backdrop of Prague with its spectral spires, there is much to appreciate in this film...and on its own terms, not just in its perceptible influence on numerous later productions. (Those who have seen \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", however, will note the visual debt that film's title villain owes to Scapinelli, the leering, top-hatted sorcerer portrayed by John Gottowt in \"The Student of Prague\".) A must-see for all students of film history.", "There are hints of Expressionism on display in Germany's August 1913 \"The Student of Prague.\" Because this was the first motion picture exemplifying an aesthetic found in later Continental movies, historians label \"The Student of Prague\" as the first Expressionist film. It certainly qualifies as Germany's first art movie.Based on Edgar Allen Poe's short story \"William Wilson,\" \"The Student of Prague\" contains several expressionistic features. Its set lighting, especially in the card-playing sequence, where the actors are highlighted at the table while the background is completely dark, was unique in 1913. This contrasting light/dark Chiaroscuro lighting would become a trademark in future German Expressionism films.Also, the story lends itself to an expressionistic idea: a financially struggling student unwittingly accepts money for what turns out to be a soulless Doppelg\u00e4nger (a mirror image of lead actor Paul Wegener, the student). Cinematographer Guido Seeber was able to create the double image within a single frame seamlessly, using the special effects split screen to convince his audience the witnessing of a real spiritual being whose ultimate existence is to ruin the student's life.The director, Stellan Rye, who died early in World War One (November 1914) in a prisoner of war camp, used the landmarks of Prague to make his fantasy tale more believable, another Expressionist imprint. Lastly, the German obsession with traits that are ripe for expressionistic examination, narcissism and greed leading to ultimate destruction, are all addressed here as well as future German classics such as \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1921),\" \" Nosferatu (1922),\" and \"Metropolis (1927).\"", "Set in the early 19th-Century and based on literary classics this pre-war release is one of the earliest film's of the fabled German Expressionist genre and one of the best and most innovative. Using cutting-edge technology and a depth unseen on the big screen \"The Student of Prague\" (Der Student von Prag) utilizes dark tones and an eerie vibe. A young man agrees to a deal with a creepy and mysterious stranger to attain what he wants and gets more than he bargains for. Overly theatrical and exaggerated acting and a slow pace coupled with being a silent may deter the film from being appreciated by 21st-Century viewers but silent fans and hardcore film lovers will appreciate this.", "In this truly fascinating, dark film, a young impoverished student sells his soul to the devil for a lot of money, in return the devil takes his mirror image (this is done brilliantly in the movie and eerily presaged when Balduin, the student is earlier practicing swordsmanship in front of the mirror), a visual metaphor for a \"man at war with himself\" which portents his immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he has made a pact with the devil, he is cut off forever from love and other riches of the soul) you can have love or you can exchange your soul for money, you cannot have both. Balduin is haunted by his double (the intertitles express this beautifully as does the action. Some of the scenes are incredible, the sense of doom when the Devil disappears with Balduin's mirror image is amazing, as is the sense that his pact has forever cut him off from human society (the scene where he runs away from his double and ends up in the 'wasteland' at the edge of the town, no longer entirely human (he has lost his soul) he is like a hunted animal outside of human society. There are so many other things to say about this incredible film. Paul Wegener was an amazing actor and director, a cultural hero of mine. It helps if you know a bit about German history at the time this film was made and about German doppelganger tradition (don't google it, get a proper book)Just remember, it's a very early film, it's a little clumsy at times, but considering what it has to say and it's tragic finale, it's one of the best ever (yes it Is!)", "The Student of Prague tells the story of young Balduin, a charismatic and devoted \"swordsman\" who is a bit out his luck in the financials and gets a bit morose as a result. Along comes creepy old Scapinelli who eventually (20 minutes into the film) strikes a deal with Balduin which grants him anything he wants in exchange for a large sum of gold. This is the real meat of the story, but unfortunately seems more like a subplot to the romance that too often takes centre stage between Balduin and a rich countess named Margit. What results is a sporadically engrossing \"horror\" movie mixed with a very slow-moving and tepid romance which goes nowhere. By the time we get to the film's inevitable conclusion, we realize it could have been told in half the time and with greater results had it not devoted much of its time to going nowhere with a love story that neither develops nor endears. Sure, Paul Wegener's loose adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's William Wilson is an important one in terms of independent, expressionist cinema, but is it worth watching now? Not really. You're better going straight to Caligari rather than stopping by to read the history of each bus stop on the way. It's occasionally interesting, and somewhat of a maverick for the times, but too mundane and plodding on the whole to make it the classic it ought to be.", "The film \"Der Student von Prag\", directed by Herr Stellan Rye in the silent year of 1913, is certainly a suitable film for the Schloss theatre. That's due to the many daring elements that the oeuvre provided this German count.The film has poor commoners, more precisely, a student commoner. He dreams of richness and of hobnobbing with top people. On the other side, there are idle aristocrats who spend their time riding and a rich heiress who is engaged to her cousin. However, he's a man who obviously she doesn't love, preferring her to be wooed by the student. That student is now a rich man thanks to a strange pact with a strange old man.Ah, what glorious clich\u00e9s!!.But there is even more! In the film are beautiful outdoor sceneries ( the filming locations were obviously in Prague ) and elegant indoor aristocratic sceneries. But the most important thing in the picture ( besides the ones mentioned by this Herr Von ) is that the picture deals with the myth of the Doppelg\u00e4nger, or the vision of the evil side of oneself!.Ah, what a wonderful sinister folklore!!.The film is starred by Herr Paul Wegener who certainly suffered a terrible experience with his Doppelg\u00e4nger in the city of Prague. Prague is a beautiful but obscure Central-European city where from time to time another strange being walked up and down the streets. That would be the Golem a screen creature that years later would also use Herr Wegener for his evil deeds. But this is another and completely different story.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count is waiting for Herr Doppelg\u00e4nger and Herr Golem to take tea.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com", "\"Der Student von Prag\" or \"The Student of Prague\" is a German black-and-white silent film from 1913, so this one is already clearly over a 100 years old. Do not be fooled by soundtracks that were added later on, this is not a sound movie. The writer and director here is Hanns Heinz Ewers and this is probably his most known work. He is not even close to being as famous as the likes of Murnau or even Lang, but it looks like he was there before them already. Unfortunately, I cannot praise his work here. It is based on a work by Edgar Allen Poe and, like so many other films, includes many references on Goethe's \"Faust\", when a young man makes a deal with somebody he should have stayed far far away. And, of course, the deal is about a woman.The movie runs for slightly over 80 minutes, at least in the version I saw, but I see that there are several way shorter versions out there too. Your choice which one to watch. I personally would recommend one of the shorter as I felt this film did not only drag on several occasions despite under 90 minutes runtime, but it also clearly lacked intertitles and would have needed many many more of these to be a rewarding watch, but also to actually let the audience understand what is going on. I had a question mark above my head for a large part of the film and this may be a reason why I lost interest quickly and give this one a thumbs down. Not recommended.", "In watching this film last night, instantly comparisons came to mind with the 1927 version starring Conrad Veidt.Overall, I believe it compares pretty favorably. First of all, it's not such a downer. The Veidt version starts with a picture of his character's gravestone. It also ends with the gravestone.This one starts with a scene in the courtyard of the college. A lot of extras were used in this scene.Another thing this one has over the later version is it's better at explaining what's going on. In one scene, Paul Wegener's double goes to kill the girl's Wegener likes' fianc\u00e9e and you have a nice title card explaining that. The later version does not.It's also interesting to see Wegener in his pre-Golem days. I wouldn't call him handsome, but he doesn't look anywhere near as fierce.Still another thing this version has over the latter one is the appearance of Scapanelli. Poor doomed John Gottowot looks much more like an evil presence than the one in the latter version.Wegener's death scene is nowhere near as spectacular as Veidt's in the latter version. In fact, in watching this, I thought he had stabbed himself, but I wasn't sure until Wegener fell to the ground.Gottowot is in the final scene and he pulls it off really, really well. I'll let you see what I'm talking about.Overall, I liked it quite a bit, better than the Veidt version.", "Director Paul Wegener also stars as Balduin, the student of the title who is short of funds and so agrees to humor the strange offer from Scapinelli (John Gottowt) to sell his reflection for a large amount of gold. Balduin is stunned when, after signing the contract, his reflection steps out of a mirror and follows Scapinelli out the door. Balduin uses his new-found fortune to try and woo the Countess von Schwarzenberg (Grete Berger), but his mirror doppelganger causes much trouble and confusion.This is fairly primitive stuff, with an immobile camera, stage framing, and zero close-ups or medium shots. There are a number of basic doubling effects used for when Balduin and his evil twin are on screen together that surely wowed audiences of the day. The sets and costumes are fine. I'm not sure this would be of much interest to anyone outside of film historians, though, as it lacks any sense of pacing or even character beyond the most arbitrary.", "It's extraordinary to revisit early cinema in the silent era. As the medium was restricted by technical limitations of the time, \"scene writing\" as a term means truly distinct moments stitched together to assemble a tableau, where refinement in modern features mean adjacent scenes taking place half a world apart can feel perfectly connected as a fluid whole. With this firmly in mind, the scenes we get in 1913 herald 'The student of Prague' are crafted with utmost care to bring the story together. Given still greater importance for lack of dialogue or sound, the visual presentation is enticing. Actors' expressions and body language, costume design, set design and decoration, and the very arrangement of each instance is guided and realized with readily apparent, admirable meticulousness to convey the tale of Balduin.In the broad strokes of the narrative there are familiar elements from classic literature, and likewise timeless themes. It's the details that make 'The student of Prague' what it is, and Hanns Heinz Ewers' screenplay is wonderfully engaging. If not the most robustly captivating feature in the world, the movie is entertaining regardless, and duly absorbing. Similarly, it has been described as perhaps the world's first horror film. By the nature of the subject matter this is true, yet like genre pictures throughout the first few decades of cinema, the sense of horror here is more thematic than actual, let alone visceral. Yet that doesn't make it any less enriching as a rounding flourish.The cast is great, especially star Paul Wegener - demonstrating fine range as protagonist Balduin - and John Gottowt as conniving Scapinelli, wielding delightful physicality in a reflection of the figure's crookedness. Even as simple as the story is, it holds our attention most capably. I think Stellan Rye illustrates excellent skills as a director, and while acknowledging the constraints of the era, the technical craft is nonetheless solid. Honestly, this is just a really well made picture all around, and I think it holds up very well more than 100 years later. Any viewer who has difficulty immersing themselves in silent movies aren't apt to change their minds, but generally speaking I think a wide audience could appreciate it. For both its place in cinema history and on its own merits, 1913's 'The student of Prague' is rightly held as a landmark of the medium, and it's worth watching if you have the opportunity.", "A good film, and one I'll watch a number of times. Rich (the previous commenter)is right: there is much more going on here than is clear from the title boards, and I have to wonder how much has suffered in translation. Were there more in the original? Or was a native-language audience expected to lip-read more? Or -- since the screenplay was written by the author of the novel on which this was based -- was this a currently popular story with which the audience was already very familiar? In short, very worth a look, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put into it.The Alpha Video release touts the new organ score, but the music is not matched to the story progression in any way. Sure, it starts promisingly, but degenerates into a repetitive, Phillip-Glass-like monotony that reflects nothing of the action on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and simply watched: much better!", "One of Paul Wegener's greatest works and a milestone for both horror and artistic cinema. In horror-like scenes, this horror film tells of high spirits, vanity and fear. Loss of control and madness round off the end. What remains is a veteran of psychotic horror in a historical Prague setting that should not be missed.", "Widely considered to be the first \"art film\" ever made, The Student Of Prague tells the story of Balduin, the school's best swordsman and biggest ladies man.Sad that he's poor...he makes a Faustian deal with the devil in the form of a man named Scapinelli...so that he can get himself a sugar mama...despite the fact that the coolest girl in school actually adores him.What a dunce.One day, he happens to save a young woman who had fallen off her horse, into a river...and this girl turns out to be a wealthy countess- how convenient.Their love is, however, forbidden, because he's just too damn poor.So Scapinelli offers Balduin a deal: 100,000 pieces of gold for anything in his dorm room.Thinking he has nothing worth anything, he agrees...not suspecting that the devil will actually take his reflection.He uses the gold to buy some sick new threads, and a little bling, so that he can impress the countess's father enough to let them hang...not realizing that his doppelganger- and the girl from school- is stalking his every move.Cause, obviously she's concerned for his well being.Despite not having the baron's permission to hang with his daughter, the two plan to meet secretly anyways...in the Jewish cemetery.But they are confronted by the doppelganger, so she's understandably freaked out.Prior to this, the baron was trying to get his daughter to marry her cousin...but Lydushcka- his stalker- rats them out.So now the cousin is pissed off, and wants to duel the young swordsmith.But his relatives try to stop him, because he's the only remaining male heir in the family.And Balduin is definitely going to ruin him.However, he can't get over his ego, so the baron begs Balduin not to kill him.But before Balduin even gets to the duel...the cousin has been killed by his doppelganger.So the baron cuts off access to his daughter.Lyduschka uses the oppourtunity to try and win him over...but he's too stricken with heartbreak...and has been cursed with the obsession of having a rich wife.So he can't see a good thing when it's right under his nose...and, thus, remains alone...as he continues to be haunted by his doppelganger.Which drives him to break into the palace so that he can see the countess again...only for her to discover that he has no reflection...as it has become his doppelganger.This fate drives him toward madness...as he plans to kill the doppelganger, once and for all.But can you kill a manifestation of your own reflection without also killing yourself?This was a landmark moment in cinematic history as it was the first time a single actor- Paul Wegener- was seen playing two roles on the screen at the same time.Having been made prior to the German expressionist movement- and shot by Danish director, Stellan Rye.- the film has a much more traditional theatrical vibe.But it has some pretty sweet location shooting, that captures a glimpse of turn of the century era Prague.A real time capsule, whose narrative is a syncretization of Faust, Alfred de Musset's poem. The December Night, and Poe's short story William Wilson, that's oddly entertaining.6 out of 10."], "tt0003643": ["D.W. Griffith takes Edgar Allen Poe classics \"Annabel Lee\" and \"The Tell-Tale Heart\"; and, with some good and bad additions, creates a near-classic. Mr. Griffith creates a melancholy mood, right from the start, as the young protagonist gets an unfortunate start in life, after his mother dies; even as a baby, he looks forlorn. Quickly, the child grows up to be Henry B. Walthall; he is raised by his uncle, Spottiswoode Aitken. All goes well until Walthall begins to see \"common woman\" Blanche Sweet. Uncle Aitken does not approve; and, he orders Mr. Walthall to stop seeing Ms. Sweet. Desperate, Walthall considers murdering Aitken.The performances are terrific. Walthall is very impressive, in one of his best pre-\"Birth\" roles. Sweet and Aitken are outstanding. All rise significantly above the uneven material. The Griffith production company's supporting cast is, as usual, extraordinary. Robert Harron and Mae Marsh provide perfect contrast as a grocery boy and maid; and, you should note, their romance provides Aitken with a change-of-heart missed by Walthall's character. Eventually, the film loses direction; as Griffith tries to merge Poe with\u0085 well, see for yourself.Appropriately subtitled \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\".******* The Avenging Conscience (8/2/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Blanche Sweet, Spottiswoode Aitken, George Siegmann", "'The Avenging Conscience' isn't the weirdest movie on DW Griffith's CV, but it's well up there. This is a drama of modern 1914, but it's firmly influenced by several stories of Edgar Allan Poe, who is referenced (by name and daguerreotype image) in the film.Henry Walthall plays a young man whose mother died giving birth to him, and who apparently has no father, so he's been raised since birth by his uncle (Spottiswoode Aitken, excellent performance). We see Aitken doting on the nephew as a child, then turning harsher (in convincing old-age makeup) as he tells his grown nephew to help him in his business affairs. Aitken's character wears an eyepatch over his left eye; this seemed entirely pointless, until Walthall as the nephew starts reading Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart'. In that story, you will recall, the young narrator lives with an older man who has a defective eye ... and eventually murders him. Walthall is in love with the girl semi-next door over, well-played by Blanche Sweet. We're never told her character's real name (nor anybody else's in this movie), but we learn that Walthall makes a point of crying her Annabel. This is clearly from Poe's tragic poem 'Annabel Lee', but that makes little sense. 'Annabel Lee' (inspired by Poe's real-life marriage to his much younger cousin, who died in her teens) is about a child-like woman who dies far too soon. Why would any Poe devotee give this monicker to a more mature woman such as Sweet's character, unless he's hoping she'll die?SPOILERS COMING. Eventually, Walthall quarrels with Aitken, and kills him ... then bricks up the body in the chimney with laughable ease. From this point, the story becomes steadily less logical. For instance, Aitken's disappearance remains unsolved (Walthall claims he's left town), yet Walthall has no difficulty inheriting his absent uncle's estate, without a death certificate. And a detective (the under-rated Ralph Lewis) shows Columbo-like powers, somehow intuiting every detail of the crime ... even to noticing the brickwork in Walthall's inglenook. Walthall's house conveniently has a trapdoor escape hatch, but Lewis has just as conveniently rumbled it and nailed it shut. Then Aitken comes back as a one-eyed ghost to haunt Walthall, only it's clear that he's a manifestation of Walthall's guilty conscience rather than a genuine supernatural spook.There's an attempt to evoke the mood of 'The Tell-Tale Heart' ... in which the nervous murderer, feeling his own heart pounding in his chest, mistakes it for the still-beating heart of his victim. But this is a silent film, so -- instead of the sound of a heartbeat -- we see detective Lewis repeatedly tapping on the tabletop. Unfortunately, the rhythm of his taps doesn't match the steady iambic pulse of a heartbeat. More positively, there's a stand-out performance by George Siegmann as an Italian prole. Siegmann expertly emotes his prole role with just the right amount of Neapolitan gesticulation to make himself convincingly Italian, without indulging in 'mama-mia' exaggerations.Along the way to the ending, we see the ghouls mentioned in Poe's poem 'The Bells' (which had earlier inspired another guilt-stricken mellerdrammer: a stage play by Leopold Lewis, staged by Sir Henry Irving). We also see the pagan god Pan (who has little or nothing to do with Poe) accompanied by some ridiculous nappied acolytes. BIG SPOILER NOW: Oh, it turns out that the whole pesky murder (and everything that came after it) was just a dream, so Walthall is reconciled with the unmurdered Aitken, who accepts Sweet. The set dressing in Sweet's bedroom vaguely resembles a human face, but I think that's unintentional. A weird movie but definitely an interesting one, and its basic implausibility makes this story work better as a silent. My rating: 8 out of 10 just this once, but ... nevermore!", "If DW Griffith is fondly remembered at all these days, it is usually for his exhilarating rides-to-the-rescue or the breathtaking pageantry of his epics. Those who have studied his work in any depth will of course know of his fine and subtle handling of drama and romance. However far fewer have commented on his masterful evocation of atmosphere. This, his only entry into the horror genre, a genre that is nine-tenths atmosphere, is appropriately steeped in it.Griffith was of course a visual storyteller, but he learnt techniques of narrative and exposition from the world of literature. In the Avenging Conscience, he not only bases his story on the work of Edgar Allen Poe, but he juxtaposes the horrific with the beautiful and tender, as did Poe, Bram Stoker and many other Victorian horror writers. This uncomfortable contrast is established from the very first scene. As the opening shot fades in, we are clearly looking at a funeral scene, but then cut immediately to a baby in his cot \u2013 innocent life in the midst death. Throughout the picture Griffith shows an unusually high number of inserts which do not directly tell part of the story, but which add layers of terror or revulsion \u2013 such as a howling wolf or an owl hooting in the trees. A dreamlike tone is maintained throughout, with few title cards, but some snippets of Poe's poetry that relate to the story only in an abstract manner.The Avenging Conscience also contains some wonderful examples of Griffith's handling of dramatic depth. He keeps his camera at a respectful distance during the romantic scenes, refraining from facial close-ups until the latter moments, and then only using them sparingly to give them maximum impact. Some might pick at the fact that the camera is always static, and there is little editing within the scene, but in fact this just goes to demonstrate just how much a director can do with movement within the frame. To take one example from this picture \u2013 in the earlier scenes at the uncle's house, there is a birdcage with a few canaries hopping around inside it. In later scenes it is covered up, twisting forlornly on its hook. It's a great touch to establish mood, but Griffith doesn't draw our attention to it with a clumsy close-up or lumbering pan; our eyes will be drawn to it because it is moving while other things in the frame are still. Audience members will notice it without feeling like they have been forced to notice it.Sadly, the few limitations of Griffith's technique do stick out in this one. In particular, his tendency to keep all characters involved in a scene on screen at the same time makes shots (such as the uncle hiding in a bush to spy on the courting couple) look ridiculous. Also, without point-of-view shots, some moments can be a bit confusing, as it is impossible to tell who is looking at what. But these are small worries, and the Avenging Conscience is far more coherent and realistic than the many other pictures of its day.If Judith of Bethulia was a dress-rehearsal for the massive action spectacles of Griffith's longer features, the Avenging Conscience was perhaps a dry-run for the subtle romantic drama which brought balance to those pictures. But it's also one of the most unique and remarkable shots in his canon, creeping us out with horror imagery five years before Caligari, creating tension out of guilt thirty years before Double Indemnity, with a climax that will startle those who think they know Griffith's cinema.", "Henry Walthall plays a man whose love for a young girl, played by Blache Sweet, drives him to murder his doting and overprotective uncle. His guilt drives him insane, and in the climactic scene where the detective pushes him to confession, Walthall is so overcome with visions of demons driving him to hell he is on the verge of an apoplectic fit. The most notable things in The Avenging Conscience, in addition to the obvious horrific tableaux and weird scenes of Pan with nymphs at the end, is the way Griffith draws characters in different places together through intercutting and use of props and gestures, i.e. books, pictures, prayer and other things. Perhaps he already had Intolerance in the back of his head while making this oddball adaptation of several Poe works. Also the film appears to have had some influence on other filmmakers; Chaplin's Sunnyside for example, owes something to the bit with Pan at the conclusion. My copy, projected a bit fast, runs only 56 minutes, and clearly there are missing scenes which makes for a choppy continuity. There is a still from The Avenging Conscience in Iris Barry's 1940 bio of Griffith that is from a scene which is no longer in the film. A different still once thought to be from The Avenging Conscience of Griffith directing Walthall holding a pistol to his head was actually taken on the set of Griffith's lost 1914 effort The Escape. The set dressing in The Escape is basically the same as that for the Uncle's home in The Avenging Conscience with a few things switched around, which suggests the two films were shot very closely together, or even simultaneously.", "This D. W. Griffith film is an early effort by the director and shows his developing skill on the lead up to epics such as Intolerance. It's about a young man who falls in love with a girl. This love drives a wedge between him and his uncle who has set a path for him that does not allow for such frivolous distractions. This situation drives the man to murder his overbearing uncle. This event leads to madness and psychological breakdown.The story is based on Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Tell-Tale Heart' with elements of 'Annabel Lee' and 'The Black Cat' thrown in for good measure. It's a rare horror outing for Griffiths. Indeed it is one of the very first fully form horror films at all. As such it is of interest. It contains several eerie and macabre details like the ghostly spectre of the uncle back from the dead and thoughts of murder represented by a spider on web and ants attacking a larger insect en mass. It's very primitive stuff overall but that is to be expected considering its age. Worth a look if you are interested in the genesis of the horror film though.", "The opening scene sets the mood for this eerie and curious Griffith film; a family is in mourning, where the uncle (played by Spottiswoode Aitken) turns towards his infant nephew. Once the boy is a man (played by Henry Walthall), his uncle is still guiding him through life. The conflict begins when the nephew has a love interest (played by Blanche Sweet), which the uncle feels is incompatible with the plan he has set for his nephew.Loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" with appropriate takings from Poe's poem \"Annabel Lee\" to help move the plot, this is the most extrinsic of Griffith's films--neither an epic, nor a quaint romance, for which he is renowned. In most ways, it's more similar to later psychological or expressionistic films from Scandinavia and Germany. The slow pacing and use of irises and other methods add to the pang of this psychoanalytic horror. The restrained performances are even more vital, especially Walthall's forceful performance, again displaying his versatility--rarely has a nervous, psychotic breakdown been done better.It's impressive that Griffith succeeded as much as he did in such a foreign genre, especially in his imperfect period before \"The Birth of a Nation\"; therefore, the flaws are surprisingly few and excusable. Again, Griffith inserts a supplementary romance, or \"The Contrast,\" as he called it; in this movie, it is particularly misplaced, unnecessary and feckless. Perhaps its removal would have allowed for needed development of the uncle. I wonder why he was so frantic and selfish in his vicariousness. Finally, the ending is of what would be one of the more contemptible of such conventions. Griffith slightly recovers, however, with the most queer scene in the film--the Pan fantasy, in a way, reasserts Walthall's character's insanity.", "By today's standards, \"The Avenging Conscience\" is a pretty poor movie, as it uses sledgehammer symbolism to make its point---subtle, it certainly isn't! While this is nominally a reworking of Poe's \"A Tell-Tale Heart\", director D.W. Griffith wants to make sure the audience knows this again and again and again. So much could have been done with less--and the way it's done here you keep wondering why it wasn't trimmed significantly and all the direct and indirect references to the original story removed. For example, early in the story, the guy who eventually commits the murder is shown sitting at his desk reading the Poe story as well as the poem \"Annabelle Lee\" (and the main character's girlfriend is named Annabelle)! Then, images of Poe are plastered across the screen! Later, when the young man (Henry Walthall) is getting the idea of killing his uncle, you see closeups of a spider killing a fly and then (repeatedly) footage of a swarm of ants devouring a larger bug!! Believe it or not, back in 1914, such amazingly UNSUBTLE work was the norm--so you can't fault Griffith too much for telegraphing EVERYTHING! But, as I said, by today's standards it's pretty poor--and ruins the suspense.Here's the story. An uncle really loves having his young nephew (Henry Walthall) working for him. But, when Walthall tells him he's interested in a nice young lady (Blanche Sweet), the old man forbids the union and basically calls her a skank. Walthall is naturally furious, but instead of just defying the uncle and marrying her anyway, he decides to kill him--then he can have the girl AND the fortune. Once the terrible deed is done, the murderer disposes of the body in a way reminiscent of the Poe story \"The Black Cat\" and things should be just fine....but there are two problems. First, there is a witness. Second, Walthall begins hallucinating--seeing the uncle again and again--like some sort of spirit that haunts him. At first, I was impressed by the photographic tricks...but then it all became frightfully overdone--with LOTS of overacting and Jesus coming for a visit--at which point the man repents! So, while re-imagining Poe might have been a great idea, the results were so heavy-handed it undid the impact--plus Poe never would have gone for the heavy religious elements but would have stuck to madness and evil. Now madness DID appear later in the film--but the idea of redemption just isn't something Poe cared for--his characters were just crazy or evil or both! It is really hard to imagine that only a year later, Griffith came out with a much more ground-breaking production (\"A Birth of a Nation\"--a very racist but technically brilliant film). So much progress in only one year is astounding. Within a couple years, his \"Intolerance\" would produce a film that is still astoundingly advanced in many ways even today....but no such brilliance is here in \"The Avenging Conscience\". Obvious, heavy-handed and dull...this should have been a lot better.", "Poe's psychological story \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" uneasily receives Griffith's trademark Victorian approach \u0096 turning the madman anti-hero of the original into a frustrated love-struck milquetoast! The broad gestures typical of Silent-film acting render the proceedings unintentionally comical now, especially where the ghostly apparition of the murdered relative is concerned \u0096 who, by the way, is fitted with an eye-patch throughout and, yet, no reference whatsoever is made to his all-important \"vulture eye\"!!Still, the various hallucinations at the climax \u0096 crude though they may be \u0096 are reasonably effective. Incidentally, the stilted presentation and moralistic overtones evident here also marked the other Griffith horror effort that I've watched \u0096 THE SORROWS OF Satan (1926); all I can say is that, in spite of the solid reputation THE AVENGING CONSCIENCE enjoys within the director's canon, personally I was underwhelmed by the film on a preliminary viewing.Other cinematic adaptations of the classic tale I've checked out \u0096 all of them relatively recently \u0096 are the interesting 1928 short (viewed on the very same day as the Griffith title), the so-so 1936 British feature-length version and a pretty good animated rendition of it from 1953.", "Avenging Conscience; Thou Shalt Not Kill, The (1914)*** (out of 4)Feature from D.W. Griffith, which he quickly shot before he started filming on The Birth of a Nation. An uncle is constantly putting presure on his nephew (Henry B. Walthall) to spend more time on his work. When the nephew falls in love with a local girl (Blanche Sweet) the uncle demands that they call it off. When the nephew can't think of anything else, he decides the only way to keep the girl is by killing the uncle. This film is based on several Edgar Allan Poe stories with the second half of the film dealing mainly with The Tell-Tale Heart. You can tell this film was quickly made but there's still some nice direction, good performances and G.W. Bitzer's wonderful cinematography. There's some nice scenes dealing with devils and ghouls from Hell as well as a scene of Jesus. The special effects are quite nice for the era as well. Mae Marsh and Ralph Lewis have small parts. Due to the lack of copyright laws at the time, Griffith used all these short Poe stories without any credit being given.", "Henry B. Walthall stars as the Nephew, who has been raised and doted upon by his Uncle (Spottiswoode Aiken). But when the Nephew meets the Sweetheart (Blanche Sweet), the Uncle objects to their plans to get married. This leads the Nephew down a path toward murder and madness. Also featuring George Siegmann as the Italian.This is a pretty strange movie, with a lot of unexpected developments and odd imagery, including floating Jesus, Moses and the Ten Commanments, shirtless kids crawling out of a tree, a devil hanging out with animal-headed friends, Pan playing his flute, and Mae Marsh deciding that the best way to get a man is to wear a waitress outfit. Walthall is very entertaining, especially in the unhinged final quarter of the movie. The very last section is a cheat, but not totally unexpected. This didn't hold the cultural impact of The Birth of a Nation or display the kind of artistic ambition of Intolerance, but in many ways I found this more entertaining. Recommended.", "The ending is a bit far-fetched, but this is a wonderful adaptation of Poe - not just \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", but other writings as well. Henry B. Walthall is perfect as the obedient, loving, and dominated nephew to his kind but overbearing uncle (Spottiswoode Aiken). There is surprising violence for a film made in 1914, and several twists and turns to the plot. Griffith does a remarkable job of showing the love between the nephew and his girlfriend, Annabelle, and the agony they experience when the uncle expects them to end their relationship, as well as the heartrending stress experienced by the nephew, who wants desperately to please his uncle, who is his only living relative. Well worth watching.", "Henry B. Walthall loves Blanche Sweet, but Henry's uncle, Spottiswoode Aitken, is not willing to share the love of his nephew with anyone and forbids Henry's marriage to the girl he calls Annabelle Lee. In a rage, Walthall kills his uncle and buries the corpse in the fireplace. His conscience will not let the ghost rest.D.W. Griffith, freed from the strictures of his Biograph bosses, digs into several Edgar Allen Poe pieces, including 'Annabelle Lee\", and \"The Tell-Tale Heart.\" Griffith is still working at developing his control of the feature-length movie, and there are several subplots that lead nowhere. He is also apparently trying to work out a series of symbolic shots, like the one with ghouls. Cameraman Karl Brown, in hs memoir ADVENTURES WITH D.W. GRIFFITH would write about one such experiment that didn't come off.It is Griffith's corps of actors that add power to this often erratic effort. Walthall's performance is masterful, and George Siegmann, as \"The Italian\" watches the murder with an expression that implies more pleasure than that of the money he will blackmail from Walthall. Griffith psychological shots are interesting and work; the odd irising and focuses of the camera while Walthall is talking to detective Ralph Lewis are very evocative.In the end, this was a programmer that Griffith made, according to Brown, to keep the money coming in while he worked on his big project, and to figure out how to do the things he would need.", "Just watched this interesting suspenseful D. W. Grifith film that he made before his epic The Birth of a Nation on YouTube. In this one, Henry B. Walthall plays the grown nephew of his only living relative who disapproves of his relationship with common girl Blanche Sweet (who like me was born in Chicago, Illinois). So this nephew resolves to kill him which results in his search by police. Turns out, however, it was all a dream...There's other stuff that happens here but I'll just say that with the nearly hour running time, this was a very interesting movie to watch from the silent era with some of the then experimental shots that happen here. So while The Avenging Conscience was primitive by today's standards, it's still worth a look.", "The Avenging Conscience / Thou Shalt Not Kill (1914) :\nBrief Review -Perhaps, Griffith's only horror element but still a pathbreaking material for a crime genre which was later renamed as murder mystery. An instant but profound Classic! So, DW Griffith has made some horror material and I wasn't aware of it but Today i have learnt it. I can argue for a whole day on a topic 'What is Horror Genre'? Mostly, masses know only one definition and that's ghost or spiritual evil stuff. It ain't like that, anything that is little bit horrifying even with psychological or medical terms is also called Horror but let it be. Even, i don't agree much. So, for me this isn't a Horror film and that's why i am not gonna talk about horror proportions. For that, there are films like 'Nosferatu', 'Dracula', 'Frankenstien' and many others. The Avenging Conscience hardly has any horror element to be scared of. Two or three visualisation scenes and that's all horror you got there. I would love to call it a murder mystery though. Yes, it has more than enough content for that and in my opinion it was pathbrreaking. That scene when an investigator questions the murderer, how brilliantly Griffith has used pendulam voice, tick-tick sound and shivering hands. I mean this was more than 100 years before Christopher Nolan used the similar sounds in 'Dunkirk'? Wow! Prevented from dating his sweetheart by his uncle, a young man turns his thoughts to murder. The guilt and his fear of getting caught leads him to realisation of his conscience and then there's a twist at the end which i won't be spoiling here. Seriously, I was not hoping for the twist at the end and at one moment I was even doubtful about Griffith making such a film. Thankfully, he didn't disappoint and i was all happy after watching the film. A landmark in the genre and much before people got acquainted to such stories.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.", "(Flash Review)Would your passion for a woman drive you to commit murder of the person disallowing your hopeful relationship? In this silent film an uncle does not give permission for his nephew to pursue a certain young woman. Will this young man stoop to such measures? While making his decision, many thoughts run through his head. Many of them turn into creative and surreal dream sequences as well as subtle and obvious symbolisms, which seems to me to push the envelope for films of this period. Challenging the audiences to think about the meaning of certain scenes and shots rather than being easily entertained. In addition to the symbolism, many were shot as double negative during some dream sequences scenes. There was also a great soundtrack with some familiar classical numbers. This film is a great example of what made D.W. Griffith so notable.", "Inspired and vaguely based on Poe's The Telltale Heart and with the words of Poe's Annabel Lee on some of the titles.Some interesting shots of mad visions and of fiends from hell.For dance historians a short 'Greek/Roman' dance at a garden party.", "This is an interpretation of Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" but with a phony ending.Henry B. Walthall plays a guy in love with Blanche Sweet, but his uncle thinks she is too \"common.\" Instead of growing a pair, Walthall thinks the solution is to off his uncle. He hides the body in his fireplace wall (apparently he is an expert at masonry), and then we all sit around waiting for him to crack. Naturally, Walthall sees apparitions of his uncle, but also sees satyrs, Christ, and I presume Moses holding up two tablets saying \"Thou Shalt Not Kill.\" A good cube will produce the same effects.There is one effective scene near the end, where Walthall is being questioned by a detective. Walthall fidgets as he hears a clock ticking, and the detective tapping a pencil and his foot. However, it seems more hilarious than tense. Then Walthall tries to fend off a posse with his rifle.Sweet looks like she's had a few too many sweets, and whoever did her hair should be shot for making it look like cotton candy. She spends most of the film moping around. Robert Harron and Mae Marsh appear briefly and have a few humorous scenes together, but then disappear from the film. Wallace Reid is onscreen for about five seconds.Once the plot is resolved (and the audience is dissolved), Pan shows up to play his flute. I'm not kidding, it ain't Zamfir, it's really Pan.

Let's clarify:In 1914, \"Der Golem\" was filmed. This movie dealt with the resurrection of the Golem in modern times. Known in the USA as \"The Monster of Fate\", it is considered a lost film. Only about a minute or so survives, somewhere in Germany. Rumors have circulated for years of a single, surviving print - but this seems to be untrue.The 1920 film was actually Wegener's \"prequel\" - a film set totally in period, dealing with the creation of the clay being by Rabbi Loew, and how it is brought to life.The 1920 film is, in my opinion, a must-see; the earlier film is pretty much lost.

Thankfully, however, there are about five-minutes worth of fragments from the 1915 version that are out there to be viewed.In all honesty, these five-minutes are a true thrill for fans of the 1920 film, which was pretty much a prequel to this. There are a couple sequences shown in the fragments where we get a terrific look at the Golem make-up and this alone makes this worth celebrating. The make- up here is actually very similar to what we saw in the 1910 version, although actor Wegener was much skinnier here. There's another sequence showing a bunch of people running out of a house and into the streets, which I'm going to guess was them trying to escape from the Golem.Again, the fragments just total five-minutes but if you're a horror fan or film buff then they're very much worth watching.", "I have the seen the fragments on the Film im Herzen Europas DVD.

Troedler lays something over an anvil; The Golem picks up a hammer and strikes it, breaking one end of the anvil. The antique dealer motions Golem over to the bellows, showing it how to operate it. Golem slowly reaches over and the scene immediately cuts to the second fragment.

The count and Jessica also escape and take refuge on the roof of a high tower. The Golem follows, and we then get a very creepy close up of the Golem's face with wide open eyes as it ascends the stairs.

Golem loosens its grip on Graf, and as it does Jessica takes the opportunity to snatch the Star of David from its chest. Deactivated, We get a faraway shot of the Golem falling off the tower as the couple look down and point to where its fallen. Troedler makes it to the roof and embraces his daughter. The count joins them; all three relieved that this terrifying ordeal has finally come to an end. A title card in German then reads:NATURE DOES ALWAYS DEEP,SUCH AS WELL AS HEART,AND EVERYTHING LIVES IN DEATH,AND DEAD IS ALIVE.(ANGELUS SILESIUS)We get a final image of the decapitated head of the Golem, its body broken in pieces, lying among the tall grass. Fade to black.(End Of Spoilers)About the Golem's appearance in this film, it looks slightly different than how it appears in the 1920 prequel. For instance, the headpiece or 'hair' on the Golem is much shorter here than the shoulder length piece Paul Wegener wore in the latter film. Also the Golem itself is covered with Hebrew letters and mystical symbols.Although it is difficult to judge a film based on a few minutes of footage, I get the feeling that a very good film has been lost for all time. One can only hope that somewhere a full print that has survived the ravages of time is out there just waiting to be discovered.", "First of all, it needs to be stated that what we have here is \"Der Golem\" or \"The Monster of Fate\" and that this is the 1915 movie and not the well-known 1920 movie. The latter still exists today in (almost) its entirety, while this one we have here is considered lost in almost its entirety because only a few minutes seem to have survived. Not a surprise though as this film is over a century old now already and many films from back then have not managed to survive throughout the invention of sound and color films and throughout 2 World Wars as number one was going on at the very time this was made. This one here runs for pretty much exactly an hour in its entirety apparently and was written and directed by Henrik Galeen and Paul Wegener. Both play major roles in this film and the latter plays the title character, which was a wise choice because his size of almost 2 meters sure made him fairly creepy and powerful. Of course, Wegener also portrays the Golem in the 1920 film as this one we have here as actually the beginning of a trilogy with the 1920 film providing closure. It seems that the one in-between is lost as well, so all we have today unlike the almost impossible event happens that they really do find a copy of films 1 or 2 somewhere, the third film is all that there is left. I just watched the surviving fragments and we have the Golem in what looks like a cave, perhaps with his creator, and then we see him wreak havoc or rather people think he is about to wreak havoc. He sure seems like a tragic creature though and at the very end it looks like his affection for a women eventually leads to his demise when he falls of something like a balcony. The very final quote is a bit on the pretentious side. Overall, I was not really that impressed by what survived, but the character alone is enough to get me into watching this 1915 film I guess if they somehow manage to find the missing pieces. Until then, this review will have to suffice.", "The cinematography in this movie is STUNNING. One feels as though one were a captive in an alternate dimension of reality; an almost Lovecraftian world where the very geometry of the buildings seems to writhe and come to life. The atmosphere of Budapest in the Middle Ages seems to be captured perfectly. After the Jews being ousted from the town by royal decree, the leader of the Jewish community crafts the Golem out of clay and brings him to life in a black magical ceremony (interesting to note that among the crimes accused of the Jews in the edict, one was witchcraft). The Golem then is brought before the king and results in the Jews being allowed to remain. But the Golem falls in love(!) with a young lady and runs amok. The story is a classic and there is a considerable amount of drama here, but the real gem of this movie are the incredible visuals and the atmosphere. One of the greatest expressionist classics ever made. Far superior to \"Caligari\" in my opinion."], "tt0004121": ["This first feature length film adaptation of Sherlock Holmes' most famous adventure could almost pass as a parody of the Arthur Conan Doyle story.The scheming Stapleton, who covets the Baskervilles estate and seeks the life of its new heir, Sir Henry, is revealed as the villain right from the first. The hound-a big, friendly spotted mutt-is about as menacing as Scooby-Doo-and is seen ferociously licking the face of his first victim. When Sir Henry writes to Sherlock Holmes to ask his help in solving the mysterious goings on, Stapleton-tall and lanky-tries to hide behind the small mailbox and grab the letter when the loyal butler Barrymore comes to mail it. When that fails, Stapleton blows up the mailbox! However, knowing that Sir Henry is expecting Holmes, Stapleton disguises himself as the famous detective and shows up at Baskerville Hall (The fake Holmes and the real Holmes are sometimes played by the same actor)Meanwhile the real Holmes reads an article in the newspaper that tells how Sherlock Holmes is investigating the Hound of the Baskervilles legend. After consulting with Watson (who disappears from the picture after his one brief scene), Holmes secretly scouts around the Baskerville estate to see what's going on. Stapleton makes several attempts on Sir Henry's life but Holmes foils them all, depending more on his trusty revolver than any powers of deduction: he shoots the fuse off a bomb planted in a chandelier and later shatters a glass of poisoned wine held in Sir Henry's hand. Ultimately, he plugs the poor old Hound himself after Stapleton traps him in the beast's underground lair. At the end, Holmes disguises himself as Stapleton and confronts the villain (still disguised as Holmes) in a particularly laughable finale which includes some assistance from Barrymore wearing a suit of armor!The great Karl Freund's careful compositions and camera-work are the film's only saving graces. There's a particularly nice long shot on a hillside, done in silhouette, showing Stapleton letting the Hound loose. Critics at the time decried the film's lack of adherence to the book but it was a big hit and spawned a whole series of semi-sequels in which Stapleton functions as a kind of Professor Moriarty, plotting against Holmes and still trying to do in Sir Henry.", "This is a typical A-list film for 1914, and not bad in any way. But for the present-day viewer it suffers by comparison with subsequent versions, with their more effective pacing, modern styles of acting, and sound dialog. For enthusiasts of early German silent films, it is certainly worth seeing.This 1914 version is included, beautifully restored, in the Bonus Features of the 2019 Flicker Alley Blu-ray edition of Der Hund von Baskerville (1929).", "Normally I begin my reviews by giving my readers an idea of the set-up of the movie's plot. I won't do that here, because the novel it is based on is very well known, and has been adapted to the movie and television screens so many times. Also, this version has almost nothing to do with the story.What can you usefully say about a version of a classic Sherlock Holmes story in which the villain masquerades as Holmes, Holmes doesn't show up until 28 minutes into its 65-minute length, where Watson appears just long enough to be dismissed, where the dread Hound is a slobbery, affectionate Great Dane, and Baskerville, stated to be in Devonshire, is populated by ghillies in the sma' kilt and tam? The villain is also liberally supplied with bombs that look like cricket balls, which he uses to blow up a mail box. Horrors!Some people think this is a humorous version of the story. I think it is inept. Screenwriter Richard Oswald, in his first screen credit, adapts a stage version he had produced five years earlier, full of secret passages and chairs that trap whoever sits in them. It's clear to me that Oswald was simply trading on the name and good will of Sherlock Holmes, and director Rudolf Meinert has no more clue about what he is directing than a pig has of calculus.One of the reasons that Holmes remains a popular media character more than 130 years after his introduction, is that he first appeared shortly before the birth of the movies; by 1906, the Danes were producing a series of films about him, and his reputation as The Great Detective remains because of the wit, clean writing, and classic mystery structure that Arthur Conan Doyle provided. This one, however, adds almost nothing to the legend.

I think his first one, \"Sealed Orders\" (Det Hemmelighedsfulde X) was interesting, but this, \"Blind Justice\", is a film markedly deserving of more attention. There are many film buffs and enthusiasts out there who I think would especially enjoy this. Danish silent cinema is often overlooked in film history; Carl Theodor Dreyer's films are the exception. And so, Christensen, probably Denmark's second greatest filmmaker of the era, remains, essentially, a director of one film.This cannot be blamed on any lack of promotion of the film on Christensen's part. \"Blind Justice\" begins shamelessly with ballyhoo over Christensen's talent (not an unusual introduction). Then, he shows off a model of the villa used in the story. This is a delightful scene in itself, with the glowing windows in the model against the low-key lighting. Some, if they haven't seen the entire picture, might have seen clips of it, including this one and a few of the other most notable ones, which gives one an idea of the advanced chiaroscuro lighting and other visual effects that Christensen accomplished by 1916.From the scene with the model of the villa, the film jumps right into the story. Christensen himself performs the role of tragic protagonist. The scenes at the villa beginning the story, with Christensen meeting Ann are great, especially in displaying a mastering of lighting and cinematography by Christensen and cinematographer Johan Ankerstjerne. The film ends well, too, with monstrous horror.The film features the common (in Denmark) technique of flipping a light switch or turning on a lamp to seemingly light up rooms (they actually stop filming and setup the lighting before resuming). There are other instances of lighting made to seem diegetic, or that are diegetic; as well, there's some good use of tinting. Additionally, there are some interesting camera shots. The peephole POV ones aren't very original, but the outward dolly shot from the window that Christensen's character enters a room through is stunning. Such moments, especially early in the history of cinema, are rare enough; it's unfortunate that the films themselves can be such a rare find.", "A man is arrested and think it was the woman, who promise to help him, who betrayed him, he escape from the prison and as a bill he must get out of the world. Benjamin Christensen was a master of the silent era. With Carl Th. Dreyer he was the best known danes in the cinema-world, before von Trier.This suspensor is amazing. A movie who is directed with a touch, as only a master can do it. Especially the way he used the shadows is perfect. A really silent masterpiece. Sad that there are, so few people who have seen it.", "H\u00e6vnens Nat is the second film, that Benjamin Christensen made. His first film Det Hemmelighedsfulde X, had a very innovative camera-style. And H\u00e6vnens Nat continues in the same path. The story in this film is even better than in the first one, and its remarkable that Christensen doesn't use a lot of inter titles as in many of other films of that time. The camera movements in this film is, yet again, fabulous, and there is a really nice shot where a camera rolls backwards from a window. In this film we get a lot to know about the persons psychological background, which we did not get anything of in Benjamins first film. Its not a big question why this movie became such a big success back in 1915-1916!", "Horror film fans must acknowledge a Danish director whom contributed mightily to the themes, look and feel to today's fright movies. Beside his 1922 \"Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages,\" cinematic aficionados are unfamiliar with Denmark Benjamin Christensen's body of work, especially his early films. But the actor-turned-film director invented the horror/crime aesthetics in film that is so familiarly seen in modern motion pictures.As a stage actor, Christensen focused on being a wine salesman before introduced to cinema as an actor in front of the camera in 1911. His resources were great enough that he took control over a small Danish movie production company and personally directed his first film, 1914's \"The Mysterious X.\" Two years later he's directing another \"innocent man accused of a crime\" movie, September 1916's \"Blind Justice.\" Both films showed a remarkable sophistication in movie-making: his shot composition, camera movement, and ominous shadow lighting created numerous sequences filled with heart-throbbing, knee-buckling tension on the screen. Film historians see Christensen's first two films as one of the most astonishing directorial debuts in movie history.\"Blind Justice\" contains one of the first, if not the first fake jump scare sequences on film where viewers are jolted by a sudden movement, only to prove to the audience that everything's just innocent. Check out the 18 minute mark of \"Blind Justice\" in which Christensen positions his camera looking through a keyhole, then progressing to a silhouetted figure climbing through a window. Later on towards the movie's exciting conclusion, Christensen uses a unique jolting effect where he has the attacker suddenly jump invisibly from the side of the frame onto his victim. This quick appearance of a potential killer is seen in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 \"Pyscho\" and John Carpenter's 1978 \"Halloween,\" among in countless of other horror films.Christensen, who played the wronged-killer in \"Blind Justice,\" saw his work failing to gain an audience in Denmark during World War One, when his two movies were released. He returned to stage acting since it proved more lucrative than producing movies at that time. After the war, he spent three years researching about witchcraft, resulting in his 1922 classic.", "The second film directed by the Danish film-maker Herr Benjamin Christensen is the story of a circus acrobat, Strong John, wrongly accused of having committed a murder. When he and his child go looking for shelter in a Villa for the night, Ann, a girl who lives there, tries to help him but finally her good intentions are discovered and Strong John is captured. Thinking that the girl has betrayed him, Strong John swears to take revenge on her, namely, to put it in the ordinary Strong John words: \"I'll tie a rope around her neck\" As happened with his first film, this German Count is again astonished to see how Herr Christensen has mastered film narrative using innovative and unusual techniques for that time ( \"Haevnens Nat\" ( Blind Justice ) is a 1916 film production )and camera movements full of cinematic invention ( Strong John spying on Damen Anne through the keyhole ) all in the service of a crime melodrama film. The film has a long running time-100 minutes- but Christensen maintains the suspense and the pace in an extraordinary way. The misfortune of Strong John ( Herr Christensen himself )is as masterfully directed as his earlier film. The film has a number of different locations, but the most important one is the Villa. Herr Christensen uses the scenery in a dynamic way, never falling into the error of making a static oeuvre like the filmed theater that was common in many early productions of that time. The villa is where the story begins and where finally this tragic tale of misunderstandings and misfortunes will be brought to an end.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take a quick look at the Schl\u00f6ss in order to check that there are not uninvited guests at home.", "A handsome looking but overlong drama stylishly directed by the great Benjamin Christensen and immaculately photographed by cameraman Johan Ankerstjerne, with whom Christensen later collaborated on his celebrated semi-documentary on witchcraft, 'Haxan' (1922).The action of 'H\u00e6vnens Nat' spans 15 years; there's an awful lot going on and the film meanders somewhat before eventually arriving at a superbly lit but preposterous climax in a large elegant house designed by Hjalmar Kl\u00e6bel in which women get pounced upon, doors broken down, and so on.The hammiest performance in the film is ironically by Christensen himself as the hard done-by 'Strong Henry'.", "Almost a century after it was made, this did play in Berlin at the International Festival. Did it look a bit dated? You bet it did. From the film itself, its plot up to the acting (there are scenes in it, that are almost comical, because it's obvious that the actor is trying to fool the viewer into thinking an accident is happening).This still has an impact though, which comes down to its story and the fact that the characters do have more than one dimension. Clich\u00e9s can not be avoided, but that could not be otherwise especially because back then they weren't considered clich\u00e9s (not that many movies to make things that obvious that is). The moral tale is a nice one, the overacting might throw you off a bit, but overall this is a fine example of what good movies looked \"back in the day\" ...", "An innocent man is recaptured after escaping from prison. After his release fourteen years later he seeks revenge on the young woman he wrongly believes betrayed him. Can't help feeling poor old Strong John (writer and director Benjamin Christensen) gets a raw deal in this old melodrama. Separated from his baby son for a crime he didn't commit, he only finds any kind of peace on his final-scene deathbed, which is a bit late for the audience to feel any happiness for him. We feel like we should be rooting for him for the injustices he has suffered - and yet that doesn't sit easily with his function as vengeful villain. Beautifully shot, though."], "tt0005615": ["This is a remarkably circumstantial review of a film that all accounts seem to agree is lost although it is true that stills survive and a fairly full contemporary description. But from there, to talk of Standing's \"standout performance\" and how \"much of the film drags\".... I confess myself mystified If this curious Welshman knows something that nobody else knows he should perhaps reveal it to the world and not keep it to himself there in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. It would be rather something to have rediscovered the first full-length feature version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.The \"stocky and coarse-featured\" Mr. Standing was one of an incredibly distinguished family of British actors of whom the patriarch was his father Herbert. His brothers Jack, Guy, Herbert Jr, Aubrey and Wyndham were also actors, as were the grandchildren Kay Hammond, Guy Standing Jr., Joan and Jack Standing Jr. while the representative in the current generation is actor John Standing (properly Sir John Ronald Leon Standing, 4th Baronet), long well known to British theatre and television audiences but whom, despite the critics, cinema connoisseurs will know from Peter Greenaway's 1999 film 8\u00bd Women (all mention of which is bizarrely missing from the Wikipedia article on the actor).", "\"Life Without Soul\" is based on Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\", but it takes considerable liberties with the novel's text. To protect the sensibilities of early movie audiences, the violent acts of the synthetic monster have been downplayed, and the main action has been transformed into an extended dream sequence. No, I haven't spoilt the ending: the film's narrative makes it absolutely clear that the events onscreen are merely a dream or nightmare of the main character.Victor Frawley (played by William Cohill) is a well-to-do physician In modern (1915) Manhattan. When not treating his high-society patients or courting his fiancee Elizabeth Lawrence (Lucy Cotton), Frawley conducts experiments which have enabled him to discover \"the chemistry of life\" (whatever that is). Victor's sister Claudia (Pauline Curley), his friend Henry Claridge (Jack Hopkins) and Elizabeth all urge him to give up his experiments. Alone in his laboratory (which is large and uncluttered, and has no discernible lab equipment), Frawley falls asleep whilst reading a copy of \"Frankenstein\".The main action of the film is clearly a dream, in which Victor Frawley imagines that he is Victor Frankenstein, and other characters in Shelley's novel are depicted by Victor's friends and family: his fiancee becomes Elizabeth Lavenza, his best friend becomes Henry Clerval, his sister becomes Justine Moritz, and so forth. The dream also has a modern (1915) setting: a title card announces that we are in Europe, but it sure looks a lot like America.In his lab, Victor moulds a clay effigy of a man and then somehow brings it to life. This creature (identified in the title cards as \"the Creation\") looks like a normal human -- he even comes into the world with a shave and a haircut -- but with a few subtle details missing: in the lab sequence (the only time we see the creature naked), the actor's nipples and navel have been concealed with fishskin and make-up. Was this a clever ploy to subtly indicate the creature's synthetic origin, or were the film-makers simply intending to spare 1915 cinema audiences from the hideous sight of a man's nipples and navel? The creature is played (very well) by a stocky and coarse-featured actor with the ill-fitting name Percy Standing.The synthetic man proves he has his priorities in order: he insists that Victor create a synthetic woman. Victor constructs a she-creation, and he begins to instil her with life ... but realises the danger just in time, and he destroys the female. The male creature goes berko and immediately kills Justine, Henry and Elizabeth. These murders are depicted with a minimum of violence and no bloodshed.Victor pursues his unholy creation across the Atlantic. There is an exciting shipboard sequence in which the creature battles an entire crew of sailors, easily strangling two at once and chucking them overboard. (But the ship is laughably small for an Atlantic crossing.) Eventually, Victor chases his monster into the deserts of the Southwest, to a ravine which a title card identifies as the Grand Canyon. (I don't recognise the location: it's impressive, but it's definitely not the Grand Canyon.)SPOILERS COMING NOW. The film's climax reminds me of Erich von Stroheim's \"Greed\", although the action is different. Using himself as bait, Victor lures the monster into a cavern filled with dynamite. Victor escapes, then blows up the cavern with the monster inside. We've been told that the monster is immortal and indestructible, so apparently he's going to stay trapped forever beneath a mountain of rubble. Victor Frawley awakens from his dream. He hastily destroys his experiment and rejoins Elizabeth, telling her he will never again \"tamper with nature\".There are some good scenes and performances in \"Life Without Soul\", but the overall effect seems to be a desire to AVOID shocking or distressing the audience. We know the events are a dream, so we can't get too engaged or scandalised. As the two Victors, William Cohill is neurasthenic enough to resemble Colin Clive, without a shred of Clive's acting ability.  Pauline Curley is attractive and talented, with too little to do in her dual roles. Percy Standing gives a standout performance: ironically, the synthetic man conveys a wider range of emotions than anyone else in this movie. But much of the film drags, and too many incongruous details (the too-bare lab, the too-small ship) make this movie ludicrous and implausible. I'll rate \"Life Without Soul\" 4 points out of 10, mostly for Standing's athletic performance."], "tt0005772": [], "tt0005916": ["Only a few years later, this film would have seemed very old fashioned and simplistic, though in 1915 when it was made it was a very good tale. Its running time of 46 minutes was full-length in the 1910s but in the 1920s this film would have probably been stretched out more and been less hyper-melodramatic--especially when it came to the character of the angst-ridden young man. In fact, now that I think about it, the movie and other Bauer films I've seen all are \"angsty\" and revel in misery! A young man can't get over his mother's death. In later years, such an idea might have been used to imply that the man was gay, though didn't seem to be director Bauer's intention. An actress somehow becomes enamored with him (though this is a shortcoming in the film, as this just seems to come out of nowhere). She professes his love and he rebuffs her--preferring to dwell in his own angst-driven world. She then kills herself (again, this DOES seem a bit over-the-top since she seems to hardly know him). But then the movie gets a lot better, as the man's conscience attacks him without mercy. He begins to dream of her constantly and later even begins to see her ghost during the daytime! He is obsessed with her and his guilt over being to cold to her that it ultimately takes over his life. An interesting idea and filled with creative cinematic images and camera tricks. However, due to its extreme melodrama, it certainly won't appeal to someone who is not already a fan of silent cinema. In fact, I would recommend a newbie watch almost any silent film before Bauer's because they might scare them away from the genre. Definitely an acquired taste or a film for the devoted fan.", "There's a slight pan to the left, then a slow dolly out to a plant, a pan right to a social encounter, another dolly out to another plant. The plants give the shot bearings. From there, the camera pans right to another greeting, as they meet the bearded man. A slow outward dolly motion and a slight pan to the right bring us to more socializing. The camera pans left briefly, with the bearded man in view, as if it's interested in the party. Next, the camera goes back to the protagonist and his old schoolmate, who is obviously enjoying himself more so; the camera follows them with its gaze as they move to the left, where Andrei, the protagonist, meets Zoya for the first time, before he cowers back to the right and sits in a chair, fixated upon her appearance. Here, the film cuts to a medium shot of him in the chair, thus ending the some three-minute tracking shot.What a great film. Yevgeni Bauer was a genius. \"After Death\" is not only an astonishingly photographed motion picture; it illuminates a complex and intriguing narrative. Bauer's achievement here (and in other films) is even more amazing for its age. Based on Ivan Turgenev's novel, the protagonist is a recluse, who mostly interacts with the dead, while turning away from his aunt and old schoolmate. Bauer himself, as it becomes clear, had such morbid preoccupations and only lived until 1917. And, Russians were a people preferring tragedy, for whom other national movie industries often altered their endings to be sad.The real trick, however, is in how Bauer brings the dead alive. There is the superimposed ghost, or just an actor supposedly as a ghost. The dreams and flashbacks are my favorite, though. Most of the flashbacks are from earlier moments we've seen in the film, but Bauer also employs a flashback to the death of Zoya on stage, which is the first time we witness the event. The dreams of his with Zoya on a path between fields of tall prairie grass, especially the first one, are exceptionally well photographed by Boris Savelyev, who worked on most of Bauer's films. The overexposed emulsion in the first one gives it more of a dream atmosphere, sun bright and blurring Zoya's hair and the background. It is one of the film's most haunting images.In other scenes, light from a lamp glows on the actors' faces. There's a shot through a partially open door to begin the film, with a lighted background and dark foreground, a common composition in Bauer's work. Giving the protagonist an interest in photography is a nice touch for this wonderfully photographed film. I think Bauer intended it to be self-referential; the scene with the projector makes it clearer. In another scene, Zoya's ghost reads a poem, which she also reads on a stage earlier, referencing the source novel, as well as the film via theatre, which to this day remains the art that film most often emulates. Film also greatly affects our dreams, as well as being closely associative.This eerie masterpiece features some of the best lighting and staging of the times, with other masterful uses of low-key lighting, set design and camera positioning for interesting perspectives and use of space, as well as some nice use of tinting and diegetic lighting. There are plenty of medium shots; the close-ups of Zoya on stage seem even more memorable as a result. Furthermore, shots seem to flow into the next. It's not a long film, and so fits very compactly its complexities and beauty. This elaborates upon the film's images and represents the flowing quality that dreams and memories have. Bauer is a little quick with some of the cuts, but there isn't much I can pan this film for. I actually feel rather short on words to praise it; I found this to be a wonderful film experience--one I hope to haunt me forever.", "This very well-crafted Yevgeni Bauer melodrama turns a relatively simple story into a movie that you're not likely to forget once you've seen it. It would be quite hard not to identify with the anxiety and frustrations of the two main characters, and Bauer had an almost unmatched feel for the way to present this kind of psychological drama on the silent screen.The basic theme, which is the way that we remember interesting or important persons in our lives \"After Death\", is the kind of topic that Bauer seems to have found fascinating. A slightly later feature of his, \"Daydreams\", is a masterful treatment of similar ideas. Here in \"After Death\", the main character, Andrei, finds himself in the hold first of his mother, then of a fascinating actress.The actual story is not particularly complex, yet the psychological implications are considerable, and they can leave you with a lot to think about. Bauer also shows a keen touch for how to use the camera and lighting to good effect. His use of pans and tracking shots always seem to come at the right moments, neither over-used nor under-used, directing the viewer's attention just where he wants it to go for best effect.", "In Daydreams, it was about the living image of memory shattering the mind; once clearly defined boundaries between the images of social life and the private workings of memory were thus thrown together beyond repair. That same year Bauer reworked the theme by inversing the perspective of illusion; now it is about the dead image coming to haunt.Again, the woman is an actress. Here it is she that courts the man, before eventually withdrawing. Soon after she commits suicide for unrequited love, and the man is devastated with guilt.Generally speaking, if you are to see one of the two films - although I advise both - I would recommend the other. Except for two magnificent touches.One is the woman eventually excusing herself from the illicit meeting with the man by claiming she thought he was somebody else. So, it is not simply the ensuing nightmare that frightens but the more sinister implication that so much suffering may have sprung from coincidence, from the mind's habit of chasing chimeras.The other, is that the man is trusted with the diary of the dead girl. We do not know whether or not he was the intended partner; but, having become privy in the inner workings of her mind, he assumes his place in her narrative. So, now this narrative - the diary - of a girl yearning for love is nested inside the other, about the man's self-recrimination for not reciprocating.Oh, there is mention of the man's morbid fixation to his dead mother - again the image of her, prominently hung above the fireplace - which is a contemporary Freudian slip that must have looked chic at the time but is useless. And the appearances of the dead woman desperately call out for cinematic presentation; but the impressionist technique of the French was still several years into the future.Other than that, it's a fascinating tappestry to tease out. Bauer knew what he was doing with these films.", "Yevgeni Bauer's \"Posle Smerti\" is not a feature length film but for its sheer brilliance alone in terms of cinematic technique it deserves worthy mention alongside D.W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\" as one of the best films of 1915 and one that ranks big among the silent film classics.At its root, it is a tale of the battle between the spirit world and the world of the living as Russian legend Vera Karalli's character attempts to seduce Vitold Polonsky's character from beyond the grave.  Polonsky himself was the reason for the girl's death and it is an added element that he must deal with.But beyond the story lies Bauer, who actually might have better understood the technique of lighting, tinting, and panning even more than the American Griffith.  Of particular mention are his conscious efforts to relate the girl ghost as coming out of the shadows when she makes her appearances on earth, darker at first and then lighter as she gets closer to Polonsky. His purposeful approach to brighten her first appearance to the point where her face is a glowing ball of whiteness is remarkable.The world of the living has its tone set in various tints...yellow at the outset, blue to reflect the night time, an appropriate red for the darkroom where Polonsky views his photographs, pink for Polonsky's first appearance in the social circle in some time (as he plays a recluse), and flat black and white to illustrate the ghost world.The pinkish tones for Polonsky's social gathering, where he first views the tragic Karalli, is arguably the best scene of the film as the camera slowly pans from group to group to reflect the guests surprise that Polonsky has come at all.  The story itself is quite engaging but has nowhere near the impact of Bauer's technique.DVD watchers will also find a delightful surprise in the new score composed for the film by Nicholas Brown and performed by the ensemble Triptych. The violin-cello-piano score sets every tone imaginable at the appropriate time taking the viewer on a journey from peace to intrigue, to torment, and even terror.The nutshell:  worth watching for cinematic technique and the music alone. A possible precursor to Weine's \"Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari\" in terms of lighting and direction.  The story sets Bauer up as Russian film's answer to Edgar Allan Poe...8/10.", "Many of cinema's earliest innovations tend to be rewarded to D.W. Griffith, the controversial director who, despite his obvious talents behind the camera, did himself no favours by releasing the incredibly ambitious but undeniably racist The Birth of a Nation. The annals of film history seem to have forgotten the Russian filmmaker Yevgani Bauer, who made around 70 films during the silent era, many of which are now lost. He was experimenting with cinematic techniques such as tracking shots, silhouettes and close-ups long before they became common practice in the industry, and was incredibly gifted at blurring the lines between reality, fantasy and dream. After Death, a spooky melodrama about the dead's grasp on the living, is a solid place to start for anyone seeking out his work.Based on a short story by Russian playwright Ivan Turgenev, After Death tells the story of Andrei (Vitold Polonsky), a scholar living a reclusive lifestyle following the death of his mother. He spends his days in his study pouring over a portrait of the deceased, while his aunt (Olga Rakhmanova) tends to his needs. A friend comes to visit Andrei and begs him to break his cycle of sorrow. inviting him to an upper class social gathering. After much persuasion, Andrei eventually agrees. At the party, Bauer cleverly captures the atmosphere with a three-minute tracking shot, as all the party girls gossip behind fans at the sight of the recluse and the men chuckle as he walks by. It's a claustrophobic surrounding and Andrei is visibly uncomfortable, until he catches the eye of Zoya (Vera Karalli), a beautiful and fashionable actress who seems to develop an instant attraction to the awkward young man.Zoya writes him a very forward letter declaring her love and arranging a meeting. Again, Andrei reluctantly agrees, but Zoya flees after disliking his stuttering reaction. Three months later, and Zoya has killed herself by taking poison before a big show, and Andrei's obsession with the dead reemerges. Bauer captures Andrei's descent into depression and despair with a collection of haunting, blue-tinted dream sequences, often switching back into reality in the same scene through clever use of editing. Andrei cannot be with his lost love in the real world world, so he spends his time in the world of the dead, laying with the soul he can only visit through pictures and memories in reality. It's incredibly sad, as most Russian silents are, but After Death is also incredibly poignant, succeeding in exploring how death plays such an important factor in many of our lives, and doing so within a 45 minute running-time.", "Yevgeni Bauer must surely be one of the most underrated directors of all time! His movies are beautifully composed with haunting narratives and damaged characters. He was also experimental to some degree, playing with tracking shots to open up the cinematic space as early as 1913.After Death is surely his masterpiece, or at least one of them. It is a story of mad love; a bereaved young man is pursued by a lovelorn actress. He rejects her, prompting her to commit suicide (though the film hints there could have been additional factors to her choice). The young man, allegedly disinterested, becomes obsessed with the actress once she is dead. Visions of her appear to him in the night. Bauer blurs the line between the real and the imaginary with otherworldly imagery. Vera Karalli shines as the doomed actress; she has a Gothic beauty and already seems to belong to some other, more spiritual plane.The Birth of a Nation still gets a lot of credit for \"inventing\" modern film-making, but this is a generalization. While one cannot deny Griffith's influence, there were other groundbreaking filmmakers working in the 1910s. After Death, released the same year as Birth, is testament to that fact.", "A more modern film tells a story through the characters, but Bauer tells his story primarily through the camera- through the motion, the color and the framing in the scenes. This results in a surreal, though not entirely unpleasant experience. This is fitting to the story as well, because of its emphasis on the supernatural. The connection between Death and the human psyche plays a central role in the story, and it treats the subject similarly to an Edgar Allan Poe story. The greatest similarity to Poe is how the film does nothing to establish the main character as a reliable narrator. Through the film the audience only briefly enters the main characters point of view, mostly resulting in visions of the deceased, but most of the time we are instead watching events as an outsider. There is a voyeuristic nature to many of the scenes, with the camera watching the events of the movie from behind doors or plants. This is especially evident in the party scene the camera walks slowly around the room, learning the story through the going-ons in the settings rather than through the main characters. Ultimately the same message is conveyed through this particular scene- that our main character is somewhat of an oddity in the room- but more indirectly. I think the film is brilliant because of the mystery it presents by not handing out information so simply. The camera intrudes on the characters lives and allows the audience to pick apart the events- and this elevates what would otherwise be a cheesy melodrama into an opportunity to explore the characters minds. It's enjoyable to watch because of how the story is told more than what is told.", "Evgenii Bauer's \"After Death\" is a film that seems like a work typical to the artist and era with a few aesthetic embellishments that were absent in his later film, \"The Dying Swan\". Once again, Bauer is obsessed with death, a theme that lasted through his career (from what I understand). The characters belong to an upper part of society, where the day to day physical strife of the common worker is replaced by the afflictions of ample free time and the painful facial contortions of melancholy. With this combination of death and melodrama, only tragedy can result. A tragedy that I felt was undermined once again, by how shallow the characters and their relationships are presented. Andrei (the reclusive student) and his love Zoia (the performer) are more or less reduced to symbols for the ideas at work (much like the characters of \"The Dying Swan\"). Death, madness, and the love's brief window of opportunity are Bauer's main concerns.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINTBauer shows much more visual prowess in this film than \"The Dying Swan\". Technically, the film is exceptionally made. Bauer is able to convey ideas effectively through camera work alone. For example, Andrei's seclusion in the beginning is shot with an unmoving frame, emphasizing the emotional stagnation of being alone. Later when he is introduced to the soir\u00e9e attendees, the camera tracks him as he moves throughout the room. The dynamism of life is reintroduced to him, culminating with him meeting Zoia. I'd like to think of this scene as a very early precursor to Scorsese's famous Copa Cabana tracking shot. The aforementioned main ideas are shown just as skillfully. Bauer's somewhat romanticized version of death is shown through the staging of his actors, the low key lighting, and Zoia's translucent superimposition during dream sequences. The latter is especially effective. Zoia is radiant and has an otherworldly quality in Andrei's dark bedroom. Andrei's slip into madness is conveyed through the constant shifting in the film's tint towards the conclusion. Finally, one of my favorite moments in the film is a perfectly placed dissolve when Andrei first learns of Zoia's suicide. The film dissolve's away from Andrei's dark bedroom to the white, snowy park they last met in.Although it is hard for me to appreciate the theatrical quality of the acting and wafer thin characters (a criticism directed more at the silent era in general), Bauer's direction is very easy to admire. He made a film that spoke the language of cinema in an era when there was yet to be a common language.", "A man comes across a woman and destiny lays a hand leading them into roads they never would have foretold. Fate passes a dark shadow in their paths and tragedy turns to a twist of fate that binds them. One cannot live without the other and their destinies reunite for eternity. Led by the odd and ghastly Vitold Polonsky and the charming Vera Karalli, this is a short and quite moving film on relationships and the timelessness of fate and love. A precursor to \"Somewhere in Time\", this is one of the more profound and imaginative love stories of the silents. Directed by Yevgeny Bauer during his peak and made when the First World War was raging in Europe with Russia involved, this is one of the more watchable flicks from the distant past.", "Russian FilmNice tracking shot and some cool pans for the timeSome longer scenes to with no cuts which are impressive, especially the one at the partyAndrei sees that Zoya the girl he liked diedLearn from her family she killed herself with a position of sortsZoya might have killed her self because of AndreiSees her in his dreams againAndrei sees and feels her specter a lot nowAndrei wants to be with herAndrei does somehow and gets to be with herUnexceptional film except for the good tracking shot at the party"], "tt0005951": ["The ageing Italian aristocrat, Dame Alba d' Oltrevita ( Dame Lyda Borelli ) would like to find a second youth.

Dame Alba discovers a particular and special solution for her beauty problems: a pact with the devil.Herr Mephisto ( Herr Ugo Bazzini ) accepts but in exchange forbids her to fall in love ever, but this it seems doesn't matter to our Italian aristocrat because she is again young and beautiful. She is courted by two brothers, Tristano ( Herr Andrea Habay ) and Sergio ( Giovanni Cinni ).The last one threatens to kill himself if Dame Alba does not grant him her love but Dame Alba doesn't pay attention to him and chooses his brother, provoking Sergio's death.; She prepares to marry Tristano but the devil must have his due and Mephisto turns her into an old woman again.\"Rapsodia Sat\u00e1nica\" is a beautiful film directed by Herr Nino Oxilia, who died before his time during the World War I; this is his most successful oeuvre, a film that belongs to those stylish melodramas made in Italy in the early silent days that gave prestige to the unique style of the film productions of that European country.The film has a romantic atmosphere that fascinates immediately; delicate scenery and careful indoor settings as well as superb cinematography by Herr Giorgio Ricci. Let us not forget that part of the oeuvre was hand-coloured and that fact gives to the film a special sense of decadent and unreal feeling that fits perfectly with the story.\"Rapsodia Sat\u00e1nica\", besides its classical invocations of the myth of eternal youth ( this ageing and wrinkled German aristocrat can't understand such nonsense\u0085 ) has an idealistic but melancholy view of youth as little more than the most fleeting of situations, a passing hallucination. Adding to the film's power is the presence of one of the most important Italian divas of the early silent days, Dame Lyda Borelli in one of her first leading roles. In spite of her teeth showing, Dame Borelli's performance is outstanding for the delicacy and charm she brings to her character.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has an appointment with Herr Methuselah.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/", "\"Satan's Rhapsody\" is an early Italian silent film and there is a lot to like and appreciate about it, though I really think the casual viewer would have little interest in this silent compared to many others. This is because the filmmaker, Nino Oxilia, was not looking to make a realistic film and instead went for an artsy and overly exaggerated look and style. It looks very impressive but the overacting is a bit difficult to enjoy.The story is essentially a Faust-like tale. The Devil (or perhaps he's one of the demons) offers to make an old woman youthful and beautiful...with one proviso...she cannot fall in love. He grants her wish and she immediately is quite vampish--so much so that two brother become infatuated with her. She isn't interested in one and toys with him....resulting in him ultimately killing himself! However, when she falls for the other, the trap is set for her.Many scenes focus on the leading lady, Lydia Borelli, acting and often over-acting. Something that should take a few seconds often takes minutes--especially late in the film when she is playing with what looks like a bridal veil. It's very artsy and the quality of the camera work is amazing for 1917....and the film has been hand colored and is, as a result of a recent restoration, lovely. But it's also over-done and off-putting due to the director's style and acting of the leading lady.When you compare this to Murnau's 1926 film, \"Faust\", it appears as if it was made decades later, as the camera work is even more spectacular and the film is much tighter and the acting more subdued. It's clearly a much better film BUT the pair would make for an interesting double-feature. Interesting and well made for its time, but ultimately its artsy style may be difficult to sustain your attention.", "This gender-switched version of \"Faust\" has an elderly countess selling her soul to the devil in order to regain her youth and beauty. The only condition is that she cannot fall in love. Once back in her splendor, however, she behaves recklessly and does indeed violate that contract, to the ruination of more than one man, and the inevitable fate for herself.Lyda Borelli was briefly a leading Italian screen actress-I'm not sure why her movie career ended so soon after this film-and she has an interesting presence here. But often the elegantly staged film seems over-indebted to the Theda Bara school in both her theatrics and her character look, even if the protagonist is ultimately more a tragic figure than pure \"vamp.\" It's a handsome movie that benefits from attractive settings both indoors and out, some lyrical climactic imagery, as well as lovely color tinting on the print I saw.", "\"Rapsodia satanica\" is one of the most known silent film works from Italy and it has its 100th anniversary next year. The version I watched went on for 45 minutes, but there may be some lost scenes as the original is even longer or this one I saw just had more frames per second. Anyway, it was one of the latest efforts by Nino Oxilia, who died only in his 20s in World War I and was already a very prolific filmmaker at this point. The fate of most of the actors in this poem-based film wasn't much better. They may not have died early, but nobody from them managed a really successful transition from silent to sound film, especially not lead actress Lady Borelli who played her part well and was quite a star in Italy back then. The story is about an old woman who makes a deal with the Devil and becomes young again. Complication ensues when 2 men fall in love with her. So yes there is a touch of Mephisto and Faust in here for sure. Sadly, overall I did not find the watch rewarding enough. Keep in mind this is silent and black-and-white, so if you want the original feeling make sure you don't catch a copy that has sound or color added later. Or just don't watch it at all. Not recommended.", "While it's unfortunate that this film as it exists is no longer 100% complete, we should be thankful that it is nearly so, with only fairly small fragments of footage having been lost. Just as much to the point, the footage that was lost generally does not seem to have been any that is essential to the plot in a way that other frames are not. With this said, it's a great joy that a title from 1917 still survives at all, and has been restored, with meticulous and varied tinting that provides marvelous garnishes of color to most every frame. Even once filming was complete it's obvious that immense care was taken to make this as much of a spectacle as it could be for early theater audiences, and for as much of a pleasure as it is to watch over 100 years later I can imagine the reaction must have been much the same in contemporary times. Of course, that post-production ardor only accentuates the splendor that this already represents: beautiful filming locations, gorgeous costume design, and lovely hair and makeup, all marked by exquisite detail. Just from a standpoint of the visuals 'Satan's rhapsody' ('Rapsodia satanica') is pretty fantastic.Speaking of fantastic, the story treads familiar but excellent territory in relating a deal with the devil and the drama that follows. However, this facet may be the one sticking point of the extant feature, for whether or not we assume that important intertitles were among the lost footage, I don't think this is great about communicating the details of the plot. We get the broad strokes, and the broad strokes are duly compelling: a vain woman bargains with the devil for youth in exchange for rejecting love; in failing to wholly reject love, consequences of fate follow for the lovers, and for the woman. This is firm foundation for a tale, but wherever one may lay blame for the storytelling shortcoming (writing, or lost footage), a more fleshed-out narrative would have only benefited the whole. As points indicating the writing, I would observe that other early Italian pieces, like 1911's definitively complete 'L'odissea,' were also nevertheless marked by toying with only the very broad strokes of the plot. More relevantly, it would make sense that plot-heavy intertitles would come in scenes with the devil, but the missing footage doesn't necessarily seem to reflect portions where those intertitles would come. One way or another, the story as we see it is fine - but could have been better, especially if the protagonist's character arc had been more drawn out and dramatic.I would also note that like some other very early silent movies, the pacing is extra lax as filmmaker Nino Oxilia lets scenes linger long. Of course the intent of so doing is to allow the cast to emote and act all the more, conveying characters' thoughts, feelings, and indeed communication through their body language and expression alone. And that's fine! That's what the silent era did, and why we love it! Still, in this case I wonder if that pacing isn't a hair too restrained. Be that as it may, the cast give commendable performances commensurate with contemporary standards of performance. Naturally Lyda Borelli, given the lead role and the most time on-screen, stands out the most, though Ugo Bazzini clearly delights in the playful deviousness of Mephisto. All around 'Satan's rhapsody' is rather well made, and should be treasured both on its own merits and as a surviving picture of so long ago. I don't think it's perfect, or a must-see, and it's unlikely to appeal to anyone who isn't already enamored of the silent era. Emphasizing the point, while the film does play with the classic horror trope of the Faustian bargain, the horror here is purely thematic and not something that we feel. Regardless, this is a vestige of another era in cinema that's worth checking out if you have the opportunity, and 'Satan's rhapsody' is a minor pleasure.", "There are two things you can say in favor of this film: It has a cool title - and it is mercifully short. The story is as trite as can be. Prologue: Some old countess makes a deal with the devil: She receives everlasting youth if she abjures love. Part one: Endless boring \"parties\" - interminably we have to watch dancing and flower throwing youths. Single small bit of plot: One of a pair of brothers falls in love with her and shoots himself. Part two: Now we have to endure her remorse in close ups and mid shots and in this gown and in that gown and some more senseless flower throwing until the predictable end releases us from this boredom.The only somewhat interesting thing is the use of various coloring techniques: You get some green dresses, yellow butterflies in close-up and a red colored Mephisto. But the acting is mediocre and the direction is terrible: There is some unintended comedy now and then when Mephisto pops up like in a Punch and Judy show.

The story has all the unbridled passion of the French author's work and several touches of the uncanny and horrible that is associated with the creator of \"The Murder in the Rue Morgue.\" Love and lust, a fatal duel, murder by poison, insane jealousy that ends in a horrible death for two more of the characters, and a father that succeeds in supplanting his son in the affections of a notorious woman, are the main incidents of a drama which deals almost exclusively with open defiance of all moral law, but which nevertheless holds the spectator's undivided attention to the end of the last reel. The heroine of this carnival of crime is a beautiful woman, a fortune teller who reads the destinies of others by the aid of crystal gazing, but fails to foresee her own finish. She becomes, successively, the mistress of three men, then doubles back to the first of the trio, the young chap whose father has had him sent to the front battle line so that he may not interfere with the elder man's intrigue with the fascinating sibyl. The drama gets its title from a wreath of black orchids which the woman has procured for the tomb of her third lover, after the young soldier fights with and supposes he has killed the gentleman, a wealthy marquis who has - willed the crystal gazer a larger fortune. Although fatally wounded, the nobleman has sufficient strength to plan and execute a terrible revenge on the woman and his rival. He succeeds in trapping them both in an air-tight vault, and then dies upon the threshold, the fourth victim of a violent death. It goes without saying that the one factor that could make such a story acceptable to the greater portion of moving picture patrons is a display of the highest artistic achievement in the drama's production. \"Black Orchids\" has received just such treatment at the hands of the director, the cameraman and the members of the cast. Rex Ingram has been particularly successful with his part of the work. While no points of the plot are glossed over or left in doubt, there is no undue stress put upon any of the incidents, and the atmosphere which surrounds the entire story belongs to it by right of birth. Artistic settings and effects are of frequent occurrence, and Duke Hayward's camera has lost none of their beauty or weird suggestion. Cleo Madison plays the French Vampire, and Wedgewood Nowell, Howard Crampton and Francis McDonald her trio of lovers. All are excellent selections physically and show fine artistic perception. \"Black Orchids\" is a tale within a tale, a story written by a celebrated French novelist and told to his capricious daughter, that she may be warned of the harm which lies within the Power of a fickle woman.

He uses his eyes, face, and careful gestures to communicate more than the most extravagant gestures could have done. Even his occasional stylized or exaggerated moments still seem to fit in with the increasing deterioration of his character's mind.The photography, flashbacks, and special visual effects are quite good for its era, and the special effects are incorporated well into the story. There is one very imaginative sequence that uses a flashback and a jump cut, in the scene when German comes to confront the Countess in her room. The techniques help to flesh out the character of the old Countess and to add extra tension to this crucial scene.The production as a whole is also of good quality, with detailed settings and good use of extras in the sequences that take place in public.

This movie has a large cast, elaborate sets and even some tricky camera-work. It's also the earliest performance I've seen so far by Ivan Mosjoukine, and it is interesting to compare to his more mature work later in France. At this point, he is clearly learning how to play down to the camera; many scenes are just perfect in tone, mostly the ones that involve Germann (not Herman, as listed in the credits) alone and reflective. Some of the more dramatic moments still carry the traces of stage performance, and come across as a bit over-the-top, but these moments are rare. Mosjoukine is already showing some of the characteristic traits of his later film acting - his hands are particularly beautiful and expressive. He also has those light, birdlike movements, especially of the head, that come across so well on film, but would have been invisible on the live stage. He was clearly giving a great deal of thought to how to bring out the best in this new technology. 'The Queen of Spades' has some nice double-exposure effects, particularly at the end, as an unshaven, ragged Germann plays with invisible cards in his cell in the insane asylum. The ghost of the Countess is very effective here, unlike in its first appearance, where it was so clearly solid it cast shadows. I imagine doing a long scene in double exposure with the two performers so close together would have been rather difficult at the time. On the other hand, the trick photography of Germann caught in a spider web as he sinks into insanity is very effective and gripping.

This Russian silent is certainly an impressive looking film as it features some nice cinematography as well as some nice performances. The highlight is certainly the sets, which look terrific and really make the film seem as if you're watching a big- budget picture.With that said, this version lacks getting the viewer caught up in its story. It really did feel as if the director was more worried about the visual look instead the of the story and the end result is something nice to look at but the power of its story never really comes across. The film also doesn't come across as haunting as it should have as the ending is a bit rushed.Still, there's no question that THE QUEEN OF SPADES is worth watching if your'e a fan of silent horror films. IT's certainly flawed but at the same time it's well-made and looks terrific.", "Spoilers Warning Elaborated: In this comment, I discuss the ending to this film (and other narrative moments), as well as the ending to \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari) (1920).With this film, \"The Queen of Spades\", director Yakov Protazanov avoids what seemed to me his greatest weakness in the other three films of his I've seen: \"Departure of a Grand Old Man\" (1912), \"Father Sergius\" (1917) and \"Aelita\" (1924). That is, his films are a series of boring long takes of long shots. In this film, the camera rarely moves, but there's some editing, especially with the fantasy sequences. It also doesn't hurt that it's from a story by Pushkin, which Tchaikovsky had adapted into an opera.The flashbacks help brake up the monotony of the static camera shots, and they do well to give the background story of the Countess. The first flashback is told by a secondary source narrator and features some well-done crosscutting between the imagined story and the storyteller. There's also a suggestion of overlapping between reality and fantasy, although not quite in the way of \"Aelita\". In one scene, the Countess dreams of a youthful liaison, only to have it dissolve to current reality where German is entering the room. There's also a scene with fantasy and reality in split-screen.The ambiguity over what is real is made more evident in the film's d\u00e9nouement when German becomes mad. The scene at the mental hospital mildly suggests the possibility that a madman had narrated the entire story. I might, however, be reading too much into it, as it doesn't seem so intentional as in the classic case of \"Dr. Caligari\". The suggestion is enough, though, and, as a result, I don't fault the film for a jump cut (which is, technically, stopping filming during a shot and then resuming without having altered the camera positioning significantly) in a scene where an extra disappears before exiting the frame.The Countess' ghost casting a shadow may be seen as an error. And, the acting is typical for the time, even though Ivan Mozzhukhin became Russia's leading star from his partnership with Protazanov. Mozzhukhin was on the side of actors who practiced stiffness, rather than gesticulation, to express their characters. Both styles are noticeably artificial and, at times, bothersome. He does a lot with the eyes, which is emphasized by the heavy mascara; a tracking shot of him, as German, entering the casino a third time highlights this.Protazanov managed, after a brief refuge in France, to continue making films in the Soviet Union; although, as far as I know, he never subscribed to the montage school, as demonstrated by \"Aelita\", which does have a communist standpoint nonetheless. He certainly didn't have the genius of Yevgeni Bauer, but that's an unfair comparison. With \"The Queen of Spades\", he does show skill, and, if I ever get a chance, I'd be happy to see more of his work.", "Here's an interesting film from the days before tireless proles dominated the Russian screens; army officers in impeccable attire gamble and drink and tell stories, pampered aristocrats stroll and saunter about in upscale establishments in Paris, and the only hint of poverty is that the poor young maid is dissatisfied by having to serve the old countess.It is important to appreciate the significance of this apart from the screen, I feel. These characters and their decadent, opulent world are months away from actually being swept away from life, as are the filmmakers and actors seen here. Both the people who inspired the characters and actors portraying them, a lot of them at least, would be forced to go on the trail and into exile in France or Germany, and for a lot of the same reasons.And this is what our film is partially about. A complacent upper class who gambles away its fortunes because there is nothing else to pass the time with, whose biggest worry is how to keep the husband count from getting to find out, or how to steal the secret way of quickly making easy money. Of course, how a countess can be in the position to have so much money to idly lose on the turn of a card is strategically absent from the film.The games of cards as fate left to chance, transient life where playing your cards in certain order does not ensure control of the outcome, and karmic retribution on the closing end of this cycle.For the most part, this is ordinary stuff right down to the supernatural visitation of guilt, except perhaps for two things.Ordinarily, the young army officer eager to learn the secret of the cards would be portrayed in ways that immediately signalled to the audience the right distance to keep from him and a karmic downfall in the works. Mozzhukhin portrays him instead as a blank slate of pensive introversion, a folded card waiting its turn and perhaps bluffing. Kuleshov would make a lot of this once Mozzhukhin had been swept away to France and Soviets had taken control of images to build reality - including Mozzhukhin's.The other is that this is not theatric, even though it seems so at first glance. Tchaikovksy had adapted the same story for the opera, and we may presume this derives from that stage. The camera is static, yes, but notice some very cinematic framing going on - a shot of the secret being whispered in flashback cuts to match the present time telling of the story among the officers. Also notice a second-hand narrator of the story and later an unreliable mind with unsure footing in the world, both these we encounter again in the films of Epstein - who, no doubt, would have come into contact with the Russian emigres in Paris, himself one.This is far from Proletkult's radical space for the eye, but as with Bauer, it has a certain stately finesse.which, no doubt, comes from a foot in the complacent life shown here.", "Described by Dostoevsky as 'the pinnacle of the art of the fantastic' Pushkin's short story of 1834 has never ceased to cast its spell and here we have the version directed by and starring the formidable duo of Yakov Protazanov and Ivan Mozzhukhin.Although Yvgeny Slavinski's camera is static we are treated to dissolves, split screen and flashbacks whilst the sets are stupendous, courtesy of no less than three art directors graciously supplied by the king of designers Alexander Benois.Pushkin describes his leading character Hermann as 'having the profile of Napoleon and the soul of Mephistopheles'. As luck would have it Mozzhukhin resembles the former and being a simply superlative actor, depicts the latter admirably. His is a performance of immense psychological depth. Also very taking is Vera Orlova as Lizaveta who is used shamelessly by Hermann to gain admittance to the home of the aged Countess so that he might learn the secret of the cards.The eternal question is whether the image of the dead Countess we see in the closing scenes of the film is a ghost wreaking revenge or a figment of imagination in the mind of a man who has sown the seed of his own destruction. That of course is down to the individual viewer.Despite an initially slow pace which tests one patience the film gradually gains momentum and becomes utterly gripping. It not only gives us in the person of Hermann a morality tale of the curse of obsessive greed but also depicts a hedonistic and privileged way of life that would soon be swept away by the tidal wave of revolution.", "The supremely stylish yet chilling 1949 British adaptation of Aleksandr Pushkin's supernatural tale is not only the best-regarded version of this particular source, but among the finest genre outings to emerge from that country; with this in mind, I do not expect it to be surpassed by any other rendition I may care to check out! The film under review (snippets from which, found on the RusCiCo/Image DVD of another popular Russian horror story i.e. THE VIY {1967}, had first intrigued me some years back!), in fact, is one of two I intend including in the current Halloween challenge \u2013 the other, even less well-known, emanating from France in 1965. This Russian production, then, dates from the early days of cinema, so that the camera remains static throughout and the cast tends to gesticulate (apart from being heavily made-up, especially around the eyes, in order for their facial expression to better register on-screen!). Still, the end result is not ineffective for all that \u2013 after all, leading man Ivan Mozzhukhin (whom I was familiar with so far via THE LATE MATHIAS PASCAL {1926}) was a genuine star, comparable in his handsome looks and thespian skills to John Barrymore \u2013 where a sudden transition, within the same shot, between the past and the present proves its single most creative touch. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the devilish pact sealing the card-playing trick is absent here, relegating the fantasy elements to the Countess' ghostly visitation at the very end!; for the record, director Protazanov would later helm the seminal Sci-Fi epic AELITA, QUEEN OF MARS (1924) \u2013 which I do own a copy of but have yet to watch", "I watched two films by Yakov Protazanov (1881 - 1945): \"Queen of spades\" (1916) and \"Aelita\" (1924). The last one was made in the Soviet Union but the first in Tsarist Russia.\"Queen of spades\" fully breathes the atmosphere of Tsarist Russia, adapted after a short story by Alexander Pushkin that was earlier adapted into an opera by Tchaikovsky.The story is situated in aristocratic circles where partying and gambling is a virtue as long as the strict codes of honor are obeyed.The film has three main characters.Hermann (Ivan Mozzhukhin) is a German officer who gambles not according to the code and is terribly punished by fate. His character represents the moral of the story.The Countess has lived by the code of honor all her live. When she was young she was well known in Paris (called \"La Venus Moscovite\"). The Countess as a young woman is played by Tamara Duvan. She looks very much like Jean Harlow. In her old days (played by Yelizaveta Shebueva) the Countess still likes party's and she still dresses up for them. All the guests pay her respect at the beginning of the evening, and the rest of the evening she just sits lonely in a corner. The Countess in her old days acts very much like Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in \"Sunset boulevard\" (1950, Billy Wilder), she is unable to see that her glory days are over.The character of Liza (Vera Orlova) is unfortunately not explored enough in this film. She is the nurse of the Countess and in this capacity obliged to stay with her in her corner while the party is going on. It is therefore no wonder that this young girl is all too susceptible when a man finally gives her some attention.", "The \"Queen of Spades,\" from 1916 is a very interesting film, worth more than the lack of attention which it has received. The film revolves around a young man named German (Ivan Mozzhukhin,) who becomes obsessed about learning a magical secret on how to consistently win at cards. He seeks to learn this secret from an elderly countess who learned about this in her youth. Eventually, he gains this knowledge after killing the countess, but at a cost to his sanity and inner peace.\"Queen of Spades,\" stands out to me for many reasons. Foremost, the film was released before the Russian Revolution, making it one of the few surviving Russian full-length films from that era. Because of this, the viewer has the opportunity to glimpse aspects of Russian aristocracy without elements of Soviet propaganda which bashes the bourgeois; which makes this a rare look into pre-Soviet Russia.As for the editing and pacing of the film, I would argue that it is very ahead of its time. Not being an expert on films of the 1910s, I have very little to compare it too, but I can say that this film is very on par with films of the early 20s. The cross dissolves in this film, as well as the double exposures during the insanity scenes work very well. I also enjoyed with film because of its effective uses of flashbacks and changes of juxtaposition.The acting in the film is nothing worth bragging about, but it isn't bad either. Without a doubt, the best performance in the film is done by the film's lead Ivan Mozzhukhin who emotes pretty well, and his expressions after he loses his mind are fairly impressive. The rest of the cast do their job well, but not great.The greatness in this film lays in its ability to tell the story, (which it is certainly an interesting story,) as well as its ahead of its time editing.I've only seen this film available online and I know of no online stores which sell it. The internet's version of this film is pretty good however, and comes with a well done sound track.I highly recommend this film for those who love early silents, especially if they like films which include elements of horror."], "tt0007744": [], "tt0007983": ["I saw 'Furcht' in July 1996 at the Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna. They screened a print with the original German intertitles, loaned by the Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Filmkunde.One of my all-time favourite films is 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari', which is by far the most famous movie directed by Robert Wiene. However, that film was in pre-production with Fritz Lang intended as the director; Wiene stepped in only at the last moment, and much of the movie's appeal is due to the remarkable production design (by Hermann Warm) or other factors for which Wiene cannot take credit. 'Furcht' is a more accurate representation of Wiene's directorial talents: it's not nearly so good as 'Caligari' (few films are!), but Wiene proves himself able to create an eerie dream-like mood which suits this story admirably. Whereas the events in 'Caligari' are clearly a madman's nightmare, the nightmarish story of 'Furcht' seems to be more firmly rooted in reality and sanity, and only gradually do we begin to feel that the events on the screen may be the protagonist's nightmare rather than his reality ... or perhaps they are both, in which case he has no escape.Bruno Decarli plays a European aristocrat in Java. He takes a fancy to a weird-looking statue of a local pagan god, which is protected by an even weirder-looking priest (played by Conrad Veidt, who is apparently portraying a Hindu). Decarli decides to steal the statue; in order to achieve this, he murders the priest. However, the priest's ghost haunts Decarli, warning him that he will die in seven days' time...Conrad Veidt was one of the best actors in silent films. He seemed rather less successful in talkies, possibly down to having aged a few years and lost the knife-edge of his virility. In 'Furcht', Veidt is astonishingly thin and absolutely compelling as a wraith. I've seen hundreds of actors portray ghosts, but Veidt's performance here is one of the very few which convinced me that the character was actually speaking from the realm of the dead. Veidt's gaunt appearance and his expressive hands skilfully convey the incessant hunger of the dead and their resentment of the living. I'll rate this movie 9 out of 10, and I wish that Weine's films came up to this standard more often.", "I have no doubt that Conrad Veidt would have been phenomenal in this movie...had he actually had a substantial role in it. Granted, the version I viewed had been edited down to 60 minutes from the original 72 (and some of Connie's scenes may have been edited out). But out of the 60 min. I saw, barely over 2 minutes are devoted to Conrad's character. Needless to say, fans of Conrad Veidt will find this film a bit of a disappointment.Fans of overwrought melodrama, however, can hardly find a better example than Bruno DeCarli's chest-clutching, flopping about the room in a paranoiac spasm, back-of-the-hand-to-the-forehead seizures...a perfect example of criticisms often aimed at silent film \"overacting.\" This is not an unentertaining film, but it has more of a novelty value than an artistic one.Since I collect Conrad Veidt films, I can honestly say that there are many more fine examples of his acting finesse than this one, including most of his talkies. In fact, a large part of what makes his films so compelling is his rich and expressive voice. He had few equals in his ability to convey a natural elegance and maturity in his roles.In seeking to experience the full gamut of Connie's ability,\"Furcht\" has little to offer. Better examples of his talent and versatility may be found in \"Jew Suss\", \"The Passing of the Third Floor Back\", \"The Spy In Black\", and \"The Last Performance\", among others.", "Though the German Expressionist movement in cinema officially began with THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1919; coincidentally from the same director as the film under review), the country's first brush with the horror genre occurred in 1913 via THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE (subsequently much-remade). The movies in this vein that emerged in between these two titles are not easily come by, so it was interesting to catch this obscure effort (which lasts for only 54 minutes!).Actually, FEAR is now the fourth Wiene I have checked out after CALIGARI itself, RASKOLNIKOV aka CRIME AND PUNISHMENT (1923; as it happens, an American potboiler from 1946 based on the same Dostoyevsky source shared its title with the film under review!), and the 1924 version of THE HANDS OF ORLAC. For the record, I am also familiar with the compressed surviving version of the director's GENUINE: THE TALE OF A VAMPIRE (1920) and own but have yet to watch his DER ROSENKAVALIER (1925).Anyway, the film's plot deals with a man haunted by a misdeed he has committed (his obsessive passion for rare objets d'art has driven him to make away with a statue from an Indian temple). In fact, the plot opens with the hero's arrival at his estate from abroad where he is already in an agitated state and orders his myriad servants to bar the entrances and exits! One of them, however, is worried by his master's paranoia and seeks advice from the town minister and the hero's former schoolteacher, who instantly realizes that what he needs is not a man of God but of Science! Soon after, he is visited by a mysterious man in Indian garb (a brief role for Conrad Veidt, later co-star of CALIGARI and protagonist of ORLAC) who prophesies that, in seven years' time, the man will meet his come-uppance by the hand of the one whom he loves most!Somewhat relieved, the hero decides to live up the time allotted to him and begins to lead a hedonistic lifestyle which, however, he soon tires of, so he picks up medicine and apparently comes up with some astonishing discovery but which he promptly destroys at its much-publicized unveiling! So, as he often says, \"on to something new\" and, now, he falls in love and plans to marry but, since the 'contract' is about to expire, he soon grows morose and alienates his intended! At the appointed time, even if he had disposed of the statue in a river in a desperate attempt to break the spell (should he not have contrived to return it to the rightful owners if any hope of clemency was to be expected?), he is so nerve-wracked that he shoots himself\u0085suggesting that he had loved himself best of all! Soon after, Veidt reappears and picks up the statue not from the river-bed but rather from where the hero used to keep it, to which cabinet it had magically returned!While the film's visuals are nowhere near as striking as Wiene's subsequent forays into outright Expressionism, the exaggerated acting style is evocative of them, since the protagonist shares the mental strain that affects the heroes of CALIGARI, RASKOLNIKOV and ORLAC \u2013 which can now be identified as something of a pattern within his work!; in the end, this is no lost classic but worth viewing nonetheless.", "Bruno Decarli (\"Count Greven\") is quite good here, as the nobleman who likes to collect works of art. When in Java, he alights on a mystical totem and decides he has to have it - despite the objections of the local priest (Conrad Veidt) whom he swiftly despatches. That's not the end of our holy man, however, as he haunts his killer with portents of impeding doom...and death! Veidt looks superb as the spirit; his (heavily made up) facial features - always hugely effective - are lit with added poignancy and the direction from Robert Wiene builds a good degree of tension as the denouement, quite literally, looms. I could have been doing with a bit more of our apparition throughout, he features really rather too sparingly, but it's still quite a well made, spooky, affair with just about enough to commend it."], "tt0008099": ["Joe May's Hilde Warren and Death is notable for being Fritz Lang's first screenplay and containing an incarnation of death that precedes his own Destiny, Sjostrom's The Phantom Carriage and, of course, Bergman's The Seventh Seal. Lang also has an uncredited role as an old priest.The film begins with a fourth wall breaking moment of including a shot of the director, Joe May, and his dog with an amusing subtitle that reads informs us that the German Shepherd had reluctantly approved of the screenplay for the film before more typical introductions of the characters and their place in the story which traces Hilde Warren's life, the challenges she faces and death's offer to claim her at successive stages of her troubles.*The print available now on Youtube is in need of restoration and the poster removed the inter-titles and replaced them with subtitles over the action which considerably shortens the running time although he claims the print is complete otherwise and I noticed nothing missing from the fairly adequate Wikipedia page summary of the plot.", "Continuing with these typical Christmas silent films, this German count last night screened at the Schloss theatre, \"Hilde Warren Und Der Tod\", a film directed by the great Austro-Hungarian director Herr Joe May and written by the well-known- and equally Austro-Hungarian-Herr Fritz Lang, so last evening was a totally Teutonic night at the Schloss.The collaboration between those two Austro-Hungarians was complicated, even tormented during those early years; Fritz Lang worked for Herr May as a screen player but he always complained that his work wasn't properly credited or, as what happened with Joe May's \"Das Indische Grabmal\" (1921), he was not allowed to direct a film that had been promised to him ( at the end of his career, Herr Lang will direct finally a colourful and bad talkie remake of that film ).\"Hilde Warren Und Der Tod\" depicts the Teutonic story in which Death sometimes pays a visit to Dame Hilde Warren,, a celebrated actress, in order to invite her to the ultimate voyage. Hilde, however is fond of the good things in life, especially groceries ( the latter is easily deduced by the sight of her zaftig German figure ). She rejects the love of Hans von Wengraf, a theatre director, but instead falls in love with a longhaired youngster, Hector Roger, and she ends up marrying him. But Herr Hector is a bandit and he will be shot by the police for holding up a bank; later Dame Hilde will find that her Germanic womb is nurturing the child of a murderer. Death reappears and renews his invitation but Hilde, decides to bring life to her child . Von Wengraf later reappears and still wants to marry her but under the condition that Dame Hilde must leave her child but our heroine refuses the offer and devotes herself to being a good mother. The child of Hilde grows to adolescence and becomes just like his father; that is to say: a criminal and an assassin. Just before the police come to arrest him, her mother kills him and is sent to the jail; in there once more the Death appears and offers her consolation and relief; Hilde this time cannot refuse.The film stars Dame Mia May who does her best( which is not enough, alas) to play the afflicted and tormented woman. Some of the longhaired set have said that Herr Lang himself played Herr Death but this doesn't seem to be true( whoever did play the part did not look at all well\u0085 ).There are obvious similarities in this Lang story to his later film \"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" (1921), a film that shares with \"Hilde Warren\u0085\" the subject of the impossibility of their main characters to avoid their cruel destiny. The treatment seems frivolous in the May film ( due to the scenario and the settings ) but there is sometimes the same dark atmosphere, especially in the last part of the film.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count is trying to get into the Christmas spirit thanks to these Teutonic films."], "tt0008252": ["Lyda Borelli goes to live with her uncle in his shadowed castle. There she uncovers a letter from from the Duke's youth, his first wife, telling of how she is dying, poisoned by Miss Borelli's uncle. Gradually, Miss Borelli comes to believe she is the receptacle of the dead woman's soul, seeking revenge, even as she lives an aristocratic, modern life in this well-produced melodrama.It's a real potboiler by the long-lasting director-writer, Carmine Gallone. He was born in 1885 and by the turn of the century was writing plays. He directed his first feature movie in 1913, and by the time he retired in 1962, had directed well over a hundred of them. His specialty was biographies of composers and costume dramas, but had a wide range which included a couple of the Don Camillio comedies starring Fernandel. He died in 1973.", "Watching the oldest of feature-length films, generally 5 reels or more, is such a trip, as much as any modern high fantasy. The vision of social values and culture of an entire century ago is curious in and of itself, but the manner in which movies were made seems extraordinary. And that's to say nothing of preservation efforts, which sometimes means reassembling a complete print from bits and pieces of several others, and possibly translating intertitles for the new edition - in 2022, we take for granted how ubiquitous cinema is, and how readily titles are maintained. With all this firmly in mind, 1917 Italian drama 'Malombra' is not be as immediately grabbing and precious as some of its contemporaries or successors in the silent era, nor ultimately as essential, but it's nonetheless a rich viewing experience that deserves remembrance. It does, however, also have issues that sadly drag it down.What greets us is perhaps modest compared to the advanced techniques and technology of the film industry that developed hereafter into the monstrosity we know today. All the same, one can't help but admire the great work that was poured into this feature. The filming locations are fabulous, and the set design and decoration as well. Costume design, hair and makeup work, and props are excellent, distinct and fetching. The fundamental arrangement of many scenes is simply grand, as many extras fill carefully realized spaces while festooned with vibrant period clothing. Moreover, just as much as these basic elements of the title's craft, it's easy to look at acting in features so old and find it a far cry from what modern viewers are accustomed to. And that impression isn't entirely wrong; for lack of verbal dialogue or sound, performances through much of the silent era were broadly characterized by exaggerated body language and facial expressions to communicate thoughts and emotions, in no small part resembling theatrical productions in that capacity. Still, it's no less of a challenge to carry the spark of artistry by physical manifestation alone, but the cast manage to do so, conveying much while saying nothing. Enjoying the spotlight of the lead role, of course Lyda Borelli stands out most of all and is given the most opportunity to demonstrate her skills.Despite being so far removed from modern viewing experiences, the construction of 'Malombra' and the contributions of its cast are no less appreciable. The writing is another question. As a matter of comparison between eras the storytelling also comes across as a trifle peculiar, and even other films of the timeframe could boast a more nuanced hand: there's an unmistakable directness to some silent pictures, and this is one of them. The plot moves with a discrete \"A to B to C\" progression, slightly stilted for the fact of it, and expository intertitles between scenes somewhat emphasize this. It's a method that seems relatively unsophisticated, and that the approach became increasingly rare over time with the further development of the medium cements that notion. Yet even putting this aside, 'Malombra' is troubled. Maybe reading the original novel would provide some illumination, yet the fact remains that in my opinion Carmine Gallone's film pointedly lacks narrative clarity. Some characters are introduced with little or no meaningful explanation to be given at any time of who they are, what their relationship is to others, or what their place is in the story. The character arc of the protagonist advances in fits and starts, and within the last 15-20 minutes makes a leap that in my mind doesn't flow naturally from what preceded it. I'm not even sure what exactly happens at the climax. The broad strokes of the plot are decisive enough, and duly enticing; the details are heavily muddled. This is deeply unfortunate, as the end result is a feeling that we're seeing a puzzle that is missing several pieces.There are some great ideas here at large, and by all means no small amount of fine work went into it. Would that the writing of the feature we see were given as much attentive, mindful care as the other aspects. Why, between lacking articulateness and - at the same time - definite excess, this seems at times to drag even though it's a mere 75 minutes long. Needless to say, 'Malombra' isn't a picture liable to appeal to anyone who isn't already enamored of the silent era, and even for silent fans I think it falls short standing next to others. Even though it has undeniable problems, however, the feature bears value for having survived the ravages of time, and its flaws do not wholly overshadow the worth of the content. There's no reason to go out of your way to find this, and one should keep their expectations in check, but if you happen to come across it, 'Malombra' is still a passably enjoyable movie.", "A young woman obsessed with the story of another young woman who was driven to death by her uncle seeks to avenge her death.\nTedious, poorly told melodrama featuring some horribly overwrought emoting from leading lady Lydia Borelli. The rushed, fragmented ending suggests some scenes are missing, but the film would probably be a dud even if they weren't", "Malombra presents one of the most praised works of the great silent era diva Lyda Borelli. Being one of the first horror-mystery films ever (5 years before Dracula), this feature is a must-see for anyone who wishes to explore rich history of film.On one hand, the premise, plot and character foundation are comparable (if not completely equal) even to the modern horror movies. Extensive and efficient use of close-up enabled actors to achieve their full potential. That was especially true in case of the main actress, who can on multiple occasions be seen showing subtle shifts of emotions using only her facial expressions (yes, this phenomenon was still a rarity in this phase of film history).However, what this film lacks is maybe the director's greater understanding of how the effects of camera movement and montage language actually work. For example, more than once so happened that a viewer is left unsure of which character says what line. Also, it is not always clear was a given sequence real or just a character's dream. Furthermore, some shots are presented in such an order that suggests they are the part of the same sequence (that is, happening at the same time), while the storyline clearly suggests otherwise. Compared to, say, works of D. W. Griffith, this film shows noticeable deficiency in storytelling skills.All this being said, Malombra, with its somewhat complex plot, decent acting and creative montage attempts, still plays an important role as a stepping stone in the development of film as an art form."], "tt0008825": ["The first German film to bear the title ALRAUNE, this movie is a rather conventional ghost story about a woman whose life bears an amazing similarity to that of her ancestor, who was burned as a witch. The ALRAUNE of the title comes from a reference to the mandrake root, which the heroine employs to save her dying child. Aside from that, there is nothing at all to connect this film with the famous Hanns Heinz Ewers novel, upon which historians have mistakenly claimed this film was based. The film was released in the U.S. under the title SACRIFICE, and a print can be found at George Eastman House. The novel was filmed more-or-less straight in 1928 (the classic version, with Paul Wegener and Brigitte Helm), in 1930 (a talky, slow-moving remake, again with Helm), and in 1952 (with Von Stroheim).

Considering that it has people involved that are usually held in high regard by me. Ernst Lubitsch was to me one of the great directors of the 30s and 40s, and his early work is not as good but still interesting. Emil Jannings was always watchable and more (when it comes to silent films to me he's one of the greats), especially in villain and authority figure roles and his role here sounded perfect on paper.'Eyes of the Mummy' sadly was to me a seriously odd film. Not awful, but Lubitsch and Pola Negri are not well served and although Jannings is one of the redeeming merits he has also been better. Like others have said, don't be fooled by the title. Which indicates that it is a horror film. It isn't. 'Eyes of the Mummy' is more a melodrama and it unfortunately does not do that aspect particularly well at all. Worth a look for curiosity and completest sake, but not much else.Jannings comes off reasonably well compared to everything else going on. His performance is not at all a subtle one, he does try too hard, but he gives it absolutely everything and is a formidable and sinister presence throughout his screen time. Some of the set design is quite elaborate.The last 15-20 minutes are effective, the part that held my attention the most (shame that it took too much time to get there) and it was well staged and lump to the throat worthy. Jannings appearing in a mirror did give me the creeps too, the one part that resembled anything close to being horror.On the other hand, 'Eyes of the Mummy' doesn't work everywhere else. Even for this very early stage of his career, this did not feel like a Lubitsch film. He tried to adopt a change of pace here and is well and truly out of his depth here, as can be evidenced by the stiff and uninvolving direction. The story never really came to life apart from the climactic moments, before that it is very turgidly paced and emotionally dreary melodrama that one finds very difficult to connect with. Especially considering that it revolves around characters that are not easy at all to get behind, due to them not being at all interesting.Mostly, 'Eyes of the Mummy' looks cheap. Some elaborate set design aside. Otherwise, it looks very static and unfocused and like it was made in a rush. Negri overacts to an embarrassing degree, some of the worst silent film acting there's been in my view, and the dancing in general is far from exotic and is unintentionally funny today. The music also does not fit in tone, orchestration or use, it was like it was written for a completely different film and it was disconcerting.In summary, watch it once but not interesting or well done enough to warrant repeat viewings. A very odd experience indeed, a contender for Lubitsch's strangest. 4/10", "Here are Lubitsch, Pola Negri and Emil Jannings back in the year 1918 at the start and before they achieved their huge fame. Of course, this is a low budget movie. The Egyptian desert scenes were filmed in a Berlin quarry and the Egyptian tomb is of absurdly cheap quality. However we can see the evident skill of Lubitsch when working with his lead actors. The fascinating personality of Pola Negri shines . I certainly wish that we had more such real women in today,s modern movies. So please enjoy this nostalgic movie. Consider that if it was remade today with millions of dollars, special effects and huge publicity ,that it might be a box-office bonanza", "... but a tragedy... of sorts. The \"Eyes Of The Mummy\" refer to the eye-holes in a doorway with a face on it that Pola Negri looks out of to scare people out of the temple of Queen Ma. There is no mummy, there is no monster, there really is no horror. This is not a complaint, but this movie is often grouped in with monster movies merely because of it's title.It's easy to laugh at a film almost 85 years old, your grand kids and great grand kids will laugh at what you currently enjoy as well. The dance that Pola does may look strange to our eyes, but the desired effect was to be exotic. The acting is typically broad and melodramatic, appropriate to it's time. With the deterioration of many silent movies, we can sometimes be thankful that the actors seemed to be overacting, we can still see their expressions even when their films are fading away.Not Pola Negri's best work, or her worst. There must be a few different cuts of this film circulating. The one I saw was about an hour and ten minutes long, not the half-hour reported here or the forty-five minutes reported on the main page for this movie. I rather enjoyed the version I saw, maybe the shorter cuts leave too much out to fill the story out.Recommended if you enjoy the genre and it's stars. If you are looking for Halloween fare, stick with Universal's later horror classics, including..yes, the \"real\" mummy movies.", "The title refers to Pola Negri's eyes. Captured by the evil Arab, Radu, (well played by Emil Jannings) Negri, as 'Queen Ma,' is forced to be his slave and trick tourists in an Egyptian pyramid by hiding within a sarcophagus with her live eyes showing through its eyeholes. A visiting painter, Albert Wendland, (Harry Liedke) supposedly the hero, falls in love with her and takes her back to Europe.The film works as a kind of proto- 'Hammer Films' melodramatic thriller, as Radu follows her to Europe tracking her down and stalking her to seek his revenge on her having left him. Jannings is darkly made up, but we still get to see his menacing eyes and gestures that made him such a super star in the next decade after the film was made. (For some reason, it wasn't released in the United States until 1922.)Pola Negri does a good job showing her gratitude, devotion and love to Wendland, as well as her alienation from her new European environment and hesitation to participate in it. It's only when she performs a 'native' dance at her coming out party that she relaxes and begins to mix and fit into her new culture (as a popular exotic dancer). Woo! But her dancing! You haven't seen anything this funny since the Babylonian dancers in 'Intolerance' (1916)! All jerky hootchie kootchie motions which briefly profile the curves of her cello shaped body (actually this type of female body was popular in films and soft core during the teens and twenties).The action really picks up as all the coincidences have Radu closing in on Ma. The whole movie is pretty well edited, but the last fifteen minutes are especially well done. While the hero tries to rush to Ma's rescue, Radu exerts his hypnotic Svengali power over her, kills her, and then, after kissing her, out of remorse, kills himself. The hero rushes in, but...too late! This is the kind of tight little thriller / tragedy that Hammer would do so well in the sixties.The Alpha Video DVD I have features a continuous piano soundtrack by Rachel Guches that has some interesting dissonances, but also the pop tune 'My Reverie' (?).Even though the silent miming is a little too much, the film tells an interesting story, moves along at a good clip, and features good acting by Pola Negri and Emil Jannings. I give it a five.", "In the late 1910s, while Hollywood was focusing mostly on serious contemporary drama, their soon-to-be significant rivals in Berlin were turning more towards adventuresome flights of fancy. Myth, fantasy, exotic lands and a touch of horror were the hallmarks of German cinema. Although better known for his unique comedies, director Ernst Lubitsch was nevertheless a capable and versatile craftsman, and at this stage was at the forefront of the Germanic style.The approach to these pictures was all about space, and for Lubitsch the most important aspect of space appears to be depth. A lot of the movement in Die Augen der Mumie Ma is towards or away from the camera. Of course, Griffith and many others in the US had been doing this for years, but Lubitsch actually shuns horizontal movement, and his pictures seem designed to accommodate movement in depth. Often there is a large empty space behind the actors, or a doorway at the back of the set leading to another room. The bric-a-brac of Kurt Richter's elaborate set design tends to be concentrated at the sides of the frame, creating a kind of tunnel effect in some scenes.What is the point of all this? Well, I think first and foremost it was probably just a style that appealed aesthetically to Lubitsch and Richter, and there is no shame in that. Nevertheless it is one that they could use to great effect. Emil Jannings often appears to be advancing eerily upon us, while good guys Harry Liedtke and Pola Negri disappear worryingly away from us. In the few shots where the actors are backed up against a wall with no space behind them, for example in the flashback where Jannings first brings Negri to the tomb, the sudden change is palpable, in a nastily claustrophobic way. And depth plays a part in all the most chilling moments, such as Jannings appearing in a mirror at the far end of the room. We simultaneously see him in the distance yet are aware he is actually behind the camera, and thus behind \"us\". These are all moves towards a more interactive cinema, in which the audience are not merely external observers, but feel they are enveloped in the film's world.Die Augen der Mumie Ma is also notable for early performances by two giant figures of German cinema, the aforementioned Emil Jannings and Pola Negri. Like Lubitsch, Jannings's area of expertise was comedy, and his Radu is a hammy caricature. But Jannings's hamming was of a good sort, and just as his excessive mannerisms could make us laugh in pictures like The Merry Jail or Faust, here they come across as grimly macabre. Negri too is a little hysterical at times, but in fact far less so than many leading ladies of German cinema, and most of her performance is refreshingly restrained, comprised of slow, delicate movements.If there is anything significantly wrong with this picture, it is its na\u00efve silliness. For example, Jannings is taken to Europe to become Hohenfels's manservant, and yet still potters about the prince's palace in his native garb, clutching his dagger and muttering about getting revenge on the woman who wronged him, whereupon the prince pats him amiably on the shoulder as if to say \"There, there old chap\". Mind you, it would probably have looked equally ridiculous had the murderous Radu been given a haircut and shoehorned into a butler's uniform. Such moments are an unintentional source of humour for me, so I don't regard them as so much of a bad thing. It goes without saying that screenwriter Hans Kraly was another collaborator on this picture whose main field was comedy, and he was most adept at creating romantic fables for fast-paced farces, a genre that doesn't exactly demand logic and cohesion. And yet, in the hands of Lubitsch, Jannings and Negri, Die Augen der Mumie Ma becomes an atmospheric and reasonably entertaining short horror adventure.", "As a piece of movie entertainment, Eyes of the Mummy is dated and unremarkable seen through current standards.  There are a few nicely nightmarish moments (especially a scene when Ma sees Radu in the mirror while nobody else seems to notice) but overall, this is no Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.On the other hand, fans of cartoonist/writer Edward Gorey will be richly rewarded by a film that appears to have been designed and directed by the illustrator of \"The Gilded Bat\" and \"The Blue Aspic.\"  The effect is uncanny and curiously involving.  It's not just the melodramatic subject matter...every detail has the Gorey touch.  One almost imagines the hand-drawn texture lines.  Any Gorey fan will find Eyes of the Mummy to be well worth the time spent.", "As others who've seen this film have mentioned, \"The Eyes of the Mummy\" is not a horror film involving any mummies; rather, it's an insipid melodramatic tragedy. It was the first of director Ernst Lubitsch's dramatic films, after having started as a comedic filmmaker. They tend to involve exotic places (this time, Egypt), which is poorly exploited here compared to other such pictures. Pola Negri, in her first appearance as Lubitsch's star, performs some exotic dancing, too.\"The Eyes of the Mummy\" is a generally uninteresting relic. The acting, especially by stars Negri and Emil Jannings, is overdone. Lubitsch employs slight dolly movements to nice effect in the finale, but otherwise the direction is prosaic and theatrical--before he mastered continuity editing with \"Madame DuBarry\" (1919). From the sampling of Lubitsch's German films that I've seen, his dramatic pictures are generally less remarkable than his comedies. With these dramas, however, he received attention in the US--leading to his emigration to Hollywood.", "Considering that this film was directed by the famed German director, Ernst Lubitsch, starred the great Emil Jannings AND it's title talks about Mummies, I was certain that I would love this film--especially since I love silent films. However, in this dreary film, you see none of the famed \"Lubitsch touch\", Jannings is just okay, the film is NOT about mummies at all and the print from Alpha Video was so fuzzy that it was a chore to watch the thing! The film is set in Egypt, though you really don't see any mummies. Instead, it's an odd tale about a weirdo (Jannings) who has kidnapped a lady (Pola Negri) and has kept her locked inside a temple. When she's rescued by a Brit, he's smitten with her and takes her back to the UK to live with him. She is worried, though, that the crazed Jannings will follow her and exact revenge. No mummies, no curse and not a whole lot of action or excitement.I wonder. With a different title and different people responsible for the film, I would have had lower expectations and therefore liked the movie more. But, as it was, it was a HUGE disappointment in practically every way.PS--I've seen quite a few films from Alpha Video. While some of their offerings are rare and hard to find, their DVDs are rather consistently of dubious quality and are rarely, if ever, restored. They are inexpensive, but they're also no bargain thanks to fuzzy or scratchy prints. If you can find other brands, you may want to try them first.", "I'm surprised that I'd never heard of THE EYES OF THE MUMMY before I sat down to watch it as it turns out to be a superior and decent little chiller. It must be one of the earliest 'mummy' films out there even though the villain of the piece isn't a bandage-wrapped fiend but rather a sinister Arab character whose love for the film's heroine sees him pursuing her across continents.For a film made in 1918, THE EYES OF THE MUMMY feels surprisingly fresh and relevant. The lack of any real budget is quite obvious in the depictions of Egypt and the like, but the story packs plenty of incident into the running time and the characters are well drawn. Pola Negri is a good choice for female protagonist and convinces in her sympathetic part. Emil Jannings goes down the all-out pantomime route as the villain of the piece and is such a delight to watch. The climax goes down a surprisingly tragic route that more modern horror films would undoubtedly baulk at.", "I never expected to see a horror film directed by Ernst Lubitsch and, while this has been touted as such and is even listed in genre-related books, it's nothing of the kind\u0085and that makes it doubly disappointing for an all-round film-fan like myself! Actually, I've seen little of the director's work made in Germany (which includes only one major title, MADAME DUBARRY [1919], also starring Pola Negri and Emil Jannings) and none of his American Silents \u0096 which means that, to me, Lubitsch has always been a master of the Talkie medium, so, bear than in mindAnyway, the title is indeed incidental to the main plot which, once again, concerns the vicissitudes of a romantic triangle (Jannings, Negri and Harry Liedtke) which can only end in tragedy. Jannings and Negri are Egyptians involved in a scam milking tourists out of their money, by having the girl lend her eyes to the \"mummy\" from inside an empty sarcophagus! When a British lord and adventurer comes to visit, she falls in love and leaves with him to England. Needless to say, Jannings \u0096 who, naturally, has feelings for Negri himself \u0096 follows them (conveniently in the employ of another English aristocrat and friend to Liedtke) in order to exact his revenge. While the plot offers no surprises (except, maybe, the fact that Jannings has a Svengali-like hold on Negri), it's also rather ordinarily handled; indeed, here one finds scarcely any evidence of the much-renowned \"Lubitsch\" touch!To be fair to the film, the famed Curse of King Tut's Tomb hadn't yet taken place (that was in 1921) \u0096 so, in all probability, the film was never intended as a horror film at all. Anyway, Jannings \u0096 who's always worth watching in a larger-than-life manner \u0096 is the best thing about the entire film\u0085but the melodramatic acting of Negri, a great star of the period, has dated badly and, indeed, she seems to do little throughout but faint!! As a matter of fact, as a means of amusing myself to counter the tedium of the film itself, as I was watching I imagined the actress discussing the shooting schedule with her director:Negri: \"What's on the schedule for today, Ernst?\" Lubitsch: \"You faint!\"The next day.Negri: \"What's on the schedule for today, Ernst?\" Lubitsch: \"You faint!\" Negri: \"Oh\u0085\"The next day.Negri: \"Er--Ernst, do I get to faint today as well, by any chance?\" Lubitsch: \"Er\u0085I'm afraid so!\"", "First of all, in spite of its title, THE EYES OF THE MUMMY isn't a horror movie. At all. It's a silent drama about the life of an Egyptian woman named Ma (Pola Negri), who is abducted and held against her will by an unscrupulous man.After being rescued, Ma is taken to Europe where she becomes a dance sensation. Ms. Negri is quite good and the dance sequences are excellent.Alas, Ma's newfound fame is short-lived, since her former captor has tracked her down with eeevil intent.This is a worthwhile film that holds the viewers interest throughout its running time. It's also notable for its downbeat ending...", "Ernst Lubitsch was one of Hollywood's more prominent film directors during the early days of sound movies, specializing in comedies of manners. He established a pattern of sophisticated romantic comedies that earned his work the descriptive label \"The Lubitsch Touch.\"The German actor-turned-director Lubitsch concentrated his very early movies on light-hearted simple comedies. He branched out into the dramatic horror category in his fourth year of directorship by tackling dark themes for his earliest surviving feature film, which was also the first of his work to be shown in the United States, October 1918's \"The Eyes of the Mummy.\" The director selected Polish actress Poli Negri to play the exotic heroine, which proved to be the first of many dramatic collaborations between the two. For her evil counterpart, veteran performer Emil Jannings, the first actor to earn a Best Actor Academy Award, was given the role of a Svengali-type abductor who imprisons Negri in an Egyptian desert lair, only to see her rescued by a wealthy painter.Jannings follows her to Europe where she is performing on the vaudeville circuit. Towards the end, alone with Negri, Jannings is about to stab her when she passes out, falling down a short flight of stairs. The actress was scripted to stumble down the stairs before crumbling to the floor. To enliven the scene, Negri decided to take the tumble above the stairs, shaking up Lubitsch. Yelling at the actor whom he thought pushed her down, the director was told by Jannings \"How was I to know what she was going to do? Did I ask you to hire this crazy Pole?\"Negri claimed she tripped over her long dress, but clearly the film does not support her. The success of \"The Eyes of The Mummy\" did motivate Lubitsch to direct more dramatic films in the future. But he never did relinquish his favorite themes presented in social comedies.Around the same time he released \"The Eyes of The Mummy,\" the director was working on a daring featurette comedy co-written by him, October 1918's \"I Don't Want To Be A Man.\" Gender roles and frank sexuality are explored with actress Ossi Oswalda, whose tomboy character expresses herself desiring to be a male, a cross-dressing one at that.Oswalda, pegged as the German Mary Pickford, thinks men have it made, both for the independence they're granted as well as possessing the permissive masculine behaviorial habits such as smoking and drinking. She attires herself in a male suit and attends a formal ball, only to meet a male doctor. Both get drunk and are attracted to one another, insofar as becoming quite intimate.What's amazing is Lubitsch was able to work for UFA Studio, created in early 1917 under Germany's Supreme Army Command. The studio was originally intended to serve as a propaganda outlet for the country in the middle of World War One. But the heads of the consolidated companies merging to establish UFA disagreed with that approach. The studio's primary financier, Deutsche Bank, won the argument the large company was to be run as a business rather than an arm of the government. UFA would be completely privatized in 1921, releasing cinema's most influential movies on the international scene for the next decade.", "This 1918 film directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch is alleged to be the first mummy horror film although there is a claim of a lost 1905 film. The only problem is that except for the title there is no mummy! The plot, well here goes. An art student in Egypt goes to an Egyptian tomb to find Ma who may possibly be Pola Negri. I say possibly because the player of the lead character is NOT identified in the credits. Ma is being held as a slave by an Arab (beautifully over acted by Emil Jannings) who is beaten up by the student who then liberates Ma and takes her back to Germany. The Arab nearly dies in the desert but is rescued by a German prince to whom he swears to serve for life. He, the Arab, is then also taken to Germany. Ma in the meantime wows them with a hootchie kootchie dance at a party and gets a theatrical contract to perform on stage. The exotic dance is a hoot. Meanwhile Ma's former Arab master comes across her and in a fit of revenge kills her. The end and all in 30 minutes and no mummy. The overacting in terms of gestures common to silent films of the period is quite present. Jannings, in semi black face, is quite effective as the villain. His repertoire of sinister facial expressions is quite large. All in all the film is an historical curiosity that I am sure Lubitsch and Negri tried to forget when they became more well known.", "\"Die Augen der Mumie Ma\" or \"The Eyes of the Mummy\" is a German movie that runs approximately for an hour. It was made in 1918, so not too long anymore until its 100th anniversary. looking at the year when this was made, it is obvious that this is a black-and-white silent film and it is an early career effort by Ernst Lubitsch, a long time before his breakthrough in Hollywood and Oscar nominations. The cast includes actually a couple famous names, especially Pola Negri and Emil Jannings, who were great stars back in the day. And the most interesting aspect is probably the film's multiculturalism as it play in Egypt (and England) for the most part, not a surprise either if you look at the title. There is a touch of horror in here, a genre in which Germany was very prolific and successful back in the day, but it is certainly not the only genre. Supernatural aspects made this probably something fairly interesting to audiences back in the day. Unfortunately, I cannot say the plot or acting kept me too interested here, so this one is really only worth watching if you are a much bigger silent film enthusiast than myself. Otherwise, you should skip it.", "A lot to like about this film and also a lot that is pretty bad. Let my first start by stating some of the good parts, the soundtrack is very will fit for the movie, the movie was a bit interesting, the visuals were nice and it felt pretty artistic. But the story was kind of a dissapointing let down that didnt have much meaning or either any good of a story, its still a fine watch though, not the best silent. 5/10.", "What an egregious waste of talent!!  It's poorly acted, indifferently directed, and badly written; too bad THIS film survived when so many other more worthy silents didn't! It's hard to believe this was made in 1918--technically and artistically, it's more like 1909. This is the sort of film you should definitely NOT show to someone unfamiliar with silent film, as it confirms every awful stereotype about them--clownish makeup, hammy gestures, and cheesy plot--and, it's boring to boot. The great Emil Jannings looks more like Othello in search of Desdemona instead of an Egyptian in search of his captive, and this time his habitual overacting is annoying rather than bravura. And, you have to be a pretty maladroit filmaker to take Pola Negri, with her angular Gypsy beauty, and make her up to look like a pint-sized Little Egypt. Take it from a die-hard silents fan who will watch ANY silent film, simply because they are silent: skip this one.", "A young woman saved from a life scamming tourists in Egypt by an Englishman is followed to the UK by the crook who has some kind of hypnotic hold over her. A blacked-up Emil Jannings glares dolefully at Pola Negri's shameless overacting in an early Lubitsch movie that sounds like a horror but is actually a dreary silent melodrama that never comes close to making us care for its characters.", "In this effective German drama with exotic touches from director Ernst Lubitsch, Albert Wendland (Harry Liedtke) is a successful painter on holiday in Egypt when he finds lovely girl Ma (Pola Negri). She's been held captive by crazed local Radu (Emil Jannings), but Albert rescues her and takes her back to Europe with him, where her exotic dancing makes her a celebrity. Meanwhile, Radu is found dying in the desert by Prince Hohenfels (Max Laurence), who saves the Arab and takes him back to Europe, hiring him on as a servant. Radu remains obsessed with Ma, and will stop at nothing to take her back or keep her from living without him.This was a recommendation on YouTube, and I watched it on a lark. I was surprised that it had such a pedigree, with Lubitsch directing and Negri and Jannings starring. They're both entertaining, with Negri's dancing a kitschy treat and Jannings mad-eyed mugging enlivening the proceedings. While this is listed as a horror film, it's not, although there's a bit about a cursed tomb in the beginning that goes nowhere. Still, I found this entertaining enough, and at just under an hour, not a great demand on my time.", "I really had high hopes for this one. UFA produced this one, and most ufa films I've seem have been great. And with Emil Jannings I expected much more. But what I got was a bore. I did a crossword puzzle while I watched it. The acting was bad. The story was boring. And the whole movie was just blah. And where was the mummy? I can't believe this movie is considered horror.", "The more silent Lubitsch I see the more I think he's was a lousy silent director who managed to succeed only because he found his niche in sound and comedy.  His ANNA BOLEYN, SUMURUN and EYES OF THE MUMMY are just plain awful.  This is a very poor film technically and even the great Jannings is wasted as the villain.  Negri is effective but overacts badly.  Her dance is just plain silly.   Only for dyed in the wool fans of the director and the two stars.", "If there's one kind of film Ernst Lubitsch is known for it's...globe-trotting adventure stories? Okay, it's early in his career, well before he'd developed the Lubitsch touch much less made it his signature, but this is just so strikingly different from everything I know about him that it's quite a curiosity on its own. Unfortunately, that's about the end of the interest because the narrative limitations that Lubitsch had on display in the lightly amusing Shoe Palace Pinkus bite him harder here in a story that demands more plot-driven mechanics in order to deliver thrills.Albert Wendland (Harry Liedtke) is a painter who goes to Egypt to explore like wealthy young men do. In the desert he sees a young woman getting water, Ma (Pola Negri), who runs away at the sight of him (this makes less sense in retrospect). While sitting at his hotel the next day, he hears tale of the mysterious tomb of the Mummy Ma from a guide to Prince Hofenfels (Max Laurence), warning him that anyone who goes to it goes mad. Naturally, Albert decides to go, and upon finding a guide, he meets Radu (Emil Jannings) who seems to live just outside the entrance to the tomb, happy to guide Albert in. This is shady stuff, but Albert goes and sees the mysterious sights within. He sees a mummy's face that opens its eyes! Truly the stuff to drive a man mad. Well, when Albert isn't driven mad, he ends up fighting Radu and discovering Ma behind the door where he hears her story about how she was kidnapped by Radu two years ago and cannot escape (so her presence at a well alone and running from another man who might have been able to save her feels...unsupported). Anyway, Albert steals her away with her permission back to England while Radu pursues, collapses in the desert, and gets picked up by Prince Hofenfels who decides that yes, he will bring this random Arab man into his household back in England. Because why not?All of this is fine. It doesn't work very well, but it functions well enough to stand on its own as an opening. I get it. Nothing terribly exciting happens, but the set design of the temple may be cheap, but it still looks pretty good. There's some interesting lighting in there, and the desert scenes look pretty good as well. Nothing really exciting, but it's fine.In England, the movie pretty much just spins its wheels for about thirty minutes. Albert introduces Ma to English society...twice, and there are close calls between Ma and Radu where Radu almost finds out about her then does find out about her but can't do anything about it. There's a scene where Ma sees a vision of Radu in her bedroom and passes out. It seems like it's meant to just increase an overall sense of danger, but the characterization is so thin at this point and the storytelling so loose and poorly connected that it doesn't work.There's a final confrontation built around a painting of Ma that Albert does that leads to a tragic ending, and nothing is felt because it's all kind of silly and not really built very well.This really just wasn't Lubitsch's area. Maybe he could have developed more, but even at this very early stage in his career, it's obvious that he was more naturally inclined for light comic stuff rather than plot-driven thriller filmmaking. It's also funny to note that The Eyes of the Mummy could have been a title of the Mummy franchise from Universal a couple of decades later, especially since those mummies never had eyes of their own. It feels like a missed opportunity.", "This German silent film is not about mummies, so the title is misleading. In German it is DIE AUGEN DER MUMIE MA, which translated is THE EYES OF THE MUMMY MA, Ma being the name of a girl who is alive and very much not a mummy. The story begins in Egypt early in the 20th century. An unscrupulous Egyptian rogue has kidnapped an Egyptian girl whom he saw fetching water from the Nile. His name is Radu and he is played by Emil Jannings. The girl is called Ma and is played by Pola Negri. The director of the film was Ernst Lubitsch. All three of them had been making films for four years and were highly experienced. So one might have thought with their talent and experience the film would be good, but it isn't. Jannings take Negri to live in the ruins of an Egyptian temple, where they are camping in a rudimentary fashion, which in fact ordinary people had been doing for thousands of years. Radu has discovered a trick he and Negri can play to get money out of tourists. There is a concealed door leading to an inner chamber, which has a face carved in it, with two eye holes. He gets Negri to stand behind it when he brings a tourist in, she looks through the eye holes and moves her eyes and he tells the tourist that those are 'the eyes of the mummy'; hence the film's title. I watched this film with German titles only, and as they were visible only briefly, just for seconds in fact, I did not manage to grasp all of the dialogue, but it was not really necessary, because the story is so obvious and, frankly, banal. There were two German men, one being Herr Wendtland, played by Harry Liedtke, who is bewitched by Pola Negri and manages to abduct and 'save' her, and takes her back to Germany with him. This is very unconvincing because Pola Negri in this film at least is very far from being bewitching, and in fact I cannot imagine anybody getting excited about her in any way, but then tastes change, and she was popular then. The other man is an older German named Prince Hohenfels, played by Max Laurence. Radu manages to make his way to Europe and there finds Negri and tries to take her back. It is only then that we realize he has had a hypnotic Svengali-like power over her. So the question arises, will his spell be strong enough to reclaim her, or will Wendtland be able to save her? This film is mediocre and does no credit to the reputations of Lubitsch, Negri, Jannings, or the others.", "If, as promised, this movie was restored then the results are simply horrible.A company called National Film Museum gave this film to another company called Hypercube IIc, in New York to digitally restore the film.But, instead of a intelligent restoration what this people did was to tint every scene to red, probably with Photoshop, with disastrous results.Douglas M. Protsik music is as unremarkable as the bad restoration. His accompaniment does not enhance the images at all.In all, the available print shown on TCM is unwatchable and I had to turn off the TV set.", "I agree the film was not restored well at all. The music did not go along with the visual images. It seemed as though whoever wrote the score was just not paying attention to the movie. The music sounded rather chipper for scenes that seemed dark and a plot that is haunting. A new version is coming out March 28,2006 with a new music score. Hopefully that one will be much better. I heard that the new score is all piano and that the composer also did the score for The Mechanical Man. Which is a very rare old silent film that was found. Looking forward to seeing it. Hopefully the next version of Eyes of The Mummy will be much more better."], "tt0008875": [], "tt0008978": ["This film stars Francis Ford as an alcoholic.

This is very impressive film from French director Gance but I think it falls short compared to his two classic epics that would follow this one. I think this films biggest problem is its running time, which seems a tad bit too long especially a few of the talking scenes, which run on and on. On the technical side this film is nearly flawless with Gance taking the influence of Griffith and really pushing it to a new level. The most impressive thing in the film are the amazing war scenes, which are downright brilliant and they really make you feel as if you are a part of the action. The scenes with the men in the trenches contain some great atmosphere and the sense of dread runs throughout these scenes. The most famous sequence in the film, and in film history, is the \"March of the Dead\" sequence, which takes nearly twenty-minutes and comes towards the end of the movie. This is certainly one of the most eerie and haunting sequences in film history and the main reason this anti-war film is still remembered today. The way Gance points the finger at the folks who weren't in the war and either living it up having fun or making money off the war, comes off very creepy and the message is certainly right there on the screen. The effects used to show the dead walking are very well done and the atmosphere here is so thick that you'll feel as if you can feel them walking towards you. The performances are all very good with Mars and Joube really sticking out. As I said, I think the film runs a tad bit too long but this is still a very impressive film with one of the greatest sequences in film history.", "The only attempt to make a peace film during the war was in France, by the great Abel Gance...'J'accuse' is almost as large in scope as 'Intolerance'. The director said that: 'It was intended to show that if war did not serve some purpose, then it was a terrible waste. If it had to be waged, then a man's death must achieve something.'\"J'accuse\" is a triangle story of Edith (Marise Dauvray), her husband Fran\u00e7ois Laurin (Severin-Mars) and Jean Diaz (Romould Joube), a poet who is in love with Edith... The three, however, are puppets in the hands of war...Edith is taken captive and returns with a child... Fran\u00e7ois and Jean... Well you have to see the film!All this now seems excessively melodramatic and not entirely impartial, but visually \"J'accuse\" is an extremely powerful film and it certainly had an impact on contemporary audiences...The film was remade by Abel Gance in 1937 in an attempt to warn against the impending World War II...", "Before I start, I am a bit confused. If the newly restored version just debuted this year, how come there are reviews that predate this? Could it be that they saw an extremely abbreviated version? Could it also be that some have reviewed a movie they never actually saw (something that's happened with the first Marx Brothers film and many other lost films). All I know is that this movie was assumed lost until quite recently and you may want to keep this in mind--the reviews were based, at best, on an earlier and less complete version.UPDATE: After talking it over with one of the earlier reviewers, I learned that there WERE other extremely truncated versions floating out there on VHS. I am glad this cleared up my confusion and thank goodness we now have the fully restored Flicker Alley version!While writer/director Abel Gance made two films called J'ACCUSE, they are both very, very different even though they are about WWI. The 1938 version is much more watchable but dated stylistically for 1938 and the 1919 version is overlong and has a blurred message BUT it also was much more important historically speaking, as for 1919, it was an incredibly innovative film.Unlike the 1938 version, a very significant portion of this film is set before WWI--perhaps too much, as it seemed unnecessary and tended to make the film a bit overlong (at nearly three hours). However, the battle scenes were very good and until THE BIG PARADE and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, they were probably the best on film. Also, since it was made mostly in 1918, there is no post-war section to the film--the war had literally just ended. The 1938 film is MOSTLY set in the intervening years--including 1938.The overall message is that war is bad and pointless, which is the same messages as the later film, but since it was mostly filmed DURING the war, there also seemed to be a much stronger anti-German bias. In other words, while war was seen as evil, so were the raping and murdering Germans. It's natural that in the midst of the war that it be portrayed that way, but it's a shame this anti-German bias was in this film and not the 1938 one (since, in WWII, the Germans were actually \"the bad guy\"--in WWI the German people and soldiers were victims just like everyone else). So the film suffers from the \"blame it all on the Germans\" myth.As I mentioned above, there were multiple messages in the film. Another important plot in the film involves friendship and love--and in that sense it is a much more conventional story. Personally, I felt this aspect of the film was the least important.Overall, a spectacular and seminal work--though one that isn't as spectacular today since better war and anti-war films have followed. The biggest problems are the stagy style, too much melodrama and its length--but when the film debuted in 1919, it was STILL much better and more watchable than most films coming out in Europe and America.", "The print I saw required my full engagement; it was in poor shape, and the intertitles were in their original French (not my native language). I couldn't even clearly see the words of one. Fortunately, Abel Gance was a very visual filmmaker. And, I understood the gist of what was said. Originally, \"J'accuse!\" was some three hours, but the video I saw was about 107 minutes. I don't know if there's more footage out there, but I hope this film will be restored (and translated) someday and made more accessible. Its cinematic merits are clear, and the anti-war message is worthy of a larger audience.The Great War ended the expansion of French cinema, ceasing the international market dominance of Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res. Now, avant-garde filmmakers like Abel Gance rose to prominence, which he did with this film. The narrative of \"J'accuse!\", in the way of Impressionism, is dictated by the characters' emotions and thoughts, and the juxtaposition of images becomes what has been called \"psychological editing\". The montages become rapid at times. One of my favorite shots, however, is a tracking long take of Jean on his homecoming. The camera follows him and turns back when he stops to see what he is looking at. There are also many symbolic images of death and religious iconography. The fantastic d\u00e9nouement of the dead soldiers of war arising to accuse climactically binds the film's message and its impressionistic aesthetic.The story involves a simple love triangle, but which is analogous to the war: the peaceful friendship the two men attain makes the point well. \"J'accuse!\" is the earliest of powerful anti-war films. It's images and message are not encumbered by too much Christian allegory or over-reaching sentimental appeals, such as with Griffith's \"Hearts of the World\" (1918) or Ince's \"Civilization\" (1916). Neither is it overly artistically obscure, and as the popular appreciation of Gance's \"Napol\u00e9on\" (1927) attests to, a large audience of film enthusiasts is out there who would treasure this forgotten monument.(EDIT: Comments below added 4 November 2012)My above comments from over seven years ago were based an abbreviated version that was available on VHS from the distributor Facets during the 1990s. Another IMDb member questioned the validity of these and others' reviews that were written before this film was restored and made available on Turner Classic Movies and the Flicker Alley DVDs. I'll take the opportunity to assure everyone that despite some of my reviews being on obscure films, I watched all of them shortly before writing my comments. Just ask me, and I'll inform of the exact source (usually DVD or VHS). Additionally, this IMDb member was incorrect in stating, \"J'accuse\" was \"assumed lost until quite recently\". There've always been incomplete prints available. What we have now is the most complete and crisp version since its initial release, which, as I expressed in my original comments, was what I longed for.Having now seen \"J'accuse\" in excellent condition, I find the film ever more remarkable\u2014a masterpiece of its time. Its cinematic Impressionism and pacifist message are clearer. There is some outstanding cinematography and editing here for 1919, including chiaroscuro effects, moving camera shots, nighttime scenes, picturesque scenery aside brutal depictions of war and its consequences and ominous images of dancing skeletons. There are iris frames and transitions, good use of fades, split screen and matte shots. In addition to Jean's homecoming, which I mentioned in my earlier comments, other outstanding scenes include those of life in the trenches and a fast-paced montage of the marching on a village. Yet, \"J'accuse\" isn't about featuring great battle scenes. The greatest scenes take place on the homefront and show the effects of war, including the darkly-lit deathbed sequence of the mother and the finale where the dead soldiers accuse the living, as well as the narrative of the allegorical love triangle that is sacrificed by war.Enhanced by a good-quality print is the film's impressionistic emphasis on light. Beams of light symbolically shine into dark rooms. Scenes of sunrises and sunsets represent Jean's \"Ode to the Sun\". Superimposed images of Edith walk through Impressionist paintings. Poetry is also essential to Gance's message. The protagonist is a poet turned shell-shocked soldier, but the images and narrative are also poetically told. As Gance once said, \"To get the public enthusiastic, you have to get the same feeling into your camera-work\u2014poetry, exaltation\u0085 but above all, poetry.\"", "With this movie full of stunning imagery and stylish technique Abel Gance proved that he need take a back seat to no one when it came to mastery of the medium, in other words he forms a triumvirate with Sergei Eisenstein and David Wark Griffith, a triumvirate in which all are equal. The First World War was barely cold in its grave when Gance shot J'Accuse - a motif that recurs throughout from the visually stunning message spelled out by infantry at the outset to the child being taught to write it on a blackboard - yet remarkably what should now seem 'dated' is still potent - seventeen years later Irwin Shaw (who may or may not have seen or been aware of J'Accuse) utilised the concept of the dead protesting at the way in which their lives were squandered in his powerful One-Act play 'Bury The Dead' - and aspects of it were re-worked by others. Like most fine social documents it employs a 'normal' story - in this case our old friend the Eternal Triangle - as a way in to the exploration of political inadequacies and its message still resonates some 87 years later. A Masterpiece.", "The first thing to bear in mind is that there are actually two movies ,the 1919 silent film -and its watered-down editing of the twenties- and the 1937 talkie which is (and is not )a remake.The silent version was filmed when the war was just over ,using real pictures of that slaughter.That was first intended as an anti -German manifesto -but only the rape scene with the big German shadow on the wall shows it-.This is the work of a pacifist ,Abel Gance,the French David Wark Griffith .The director is in the film:he is Jean Diaz -even if he does not play the part- the pacifist poet who writes an hymn to the sun (Gance already displays his love of poetry :later in a duel in \"le capitaine fracasse\" and in almost the whole \"Cyrano and D'Artagnan\" ,the actors declaim verses);Gance's depiction of a small village has the beauty of a pastoral:this quiet nature haunts him as the final pictures of \"la fin du monde\" (1930) bear witness.He bows to no one when it comes to direct movements in the crowd : the inhabitants of the village gathering around the decree of mobilization is a great moment.As is the \"farewell scene\" : Gance uses only hands on the picture and emotion reaches unbelievable peaks.Two men are fighting in the trenches.They love the same woman ,one of them is her husband ,the other her lover (Jean Diaz).At times the movie might seem patriotic -which the remake was not at all- but Gance manages to show his disgust with war.The subtitles include moving real soldiers' letters to their family.His hero becomes mad and he thinks that soldiers should write lots of letters so that their wives would receive news long before they were dead.When he comes back to his village ,the film suddenly turns supernatural,and that's Gance's genius ,one of the most famous scenes in the French cinema,which will be even more impressive in the remake:here anger gives Gance the strength of ten.Let the Dead rise from their graves! War casualties' rise from the grave will haunt the viewer till his death.\"Your dead will come back,Diaz says,and they \"ll ask you for an explanation! Shame on you ,unfaithful wives, war profiteers , politicians and president!A dance macabre, a skeletons' dance in a ring had already warned us.The 1937 remake -by no means inferior to the silent work- had to be different:Hitler had come to power and as Jean Renoir said that very year ,\"we are on the verge of a \"grande illusion\" .So Gance 's snatches of patriotism had disappeared and been replaced by strength born from despair .The 1937 \"J'accuse\" was a distraught plea for an universal peace ,and, in spite of its grandiloquence,it still stands today as one of the greatest pacifist works of all time.Besides ,the coming of sound allowed Gance to include ferocious lines (such as : \"pretty soon ,there won't be enough wood to make crosses\" ) A question I will always ask myself:I wrote it in my comment on \"Austerlitz\" :why was a convinced pacifist such as Gance so fascinated by a warrior like Napoleon (to whom he devoted two works)?", "Abel Gance in my mind was a pioneer of not just French cinema but cinema in general. All of his work is well worth the look and are visual and technical marvels, some of the techniques being one he pioneered. Some of his best works, 'Napoleon' being one of them, are revolutionary in not just silent film but also film of all kinds and are towering achievements. Is his work for all tastes? Not all, tending to be very long and sprawling with a lot of patience required.'J'Accuse', released at a time where the First World War had just ended and where feelings were raw, is another great, near-masterwork, work of his. Not quite the towering achievement that is 'Napoleon' for example, but there is more than enough to show off what made him so great and important. Whether one likes it may be dependent on their opinion on war films, personally appreciate them a lot and while not one of my favourite war films (i.e. 'All Quiet on the Western Front') it is a genre milestone and important. It is still incredibly haunting and moving.Maybe it does run a little too long, but overall 'J'Accuse's' emotional power and technical brilliance cannot be denied.Visually, 'J'Accuse' looks amazing. Not just for back then, but also then. The editing is not as \"unlike anything seen before\" quality like the innovative editing in 'Napoleon' was, but it is still very fluid and the transitioning is practically seamless throughout. The sets are also beautiful to look at. The standout visually and technically though is the magnificent cinematography, very audacious with some very interesting and beautifully composed techniques. Also with some beautifully poetic shots in the more emotional moments. The music is haunting and fits well, not over-bearing or over-dramatic or sentimentalised.Gance's direction is near-triumphant and superbly controlled. The story is still hard hitting and poignant and the message still resonates without preaching or being muddled. The war scenes are bold, wrench the gut and brought a lump to the throat and the long final scene is unforgettable in its eeriness and emotion. The acting is very good, not static or theatrical, while the characters were ones worth connecting with.Overall, excellent. 9/10.", "Here's why I deem this the most important film of the first 20 years; DW Griffith also had a lofty message to impart in Intolerance, but his Victorian saga of humanism through the ages was removed from life, unfolding in the shadow of gigantic Hollywood sets for Babylon or in Judea at the time of Christ. It was comfortably nudged in its archaic pulpit. This is important to understand, by contrast. J'Accuse is not a historical epic on WWI. Gance was drafted in the French Army's Section Cin\u00e9matographique, was discharged for ill-health, but appalled at the horror of the experience, decided to re-enlist and make a film about it. He filmed actual war booming away through the country, actual soldiers on leave from the front and expected back within days.Oh, the bulk of the film away from the trenches is old-fashioned melodrama, likely to leave the modern viewer cold. What does hold power, is that it is about war inspiring Gance to make the film denouncing war.See, our protagonist is an artist. Like Gance, he is a poet committed to pacifism and blessed with the gift of granting vision, look at the poem he recites to his elderly mother, rendered in silent images, the sun rising over heaving seas. This is a great moment, later repeated for contrast in the midst of muddy war.So, the poet enlists in the army to save a girl he loves but is not his, not solely his at any rate, and is really the whole of France. This all preamble of course - a man who grants visions brought to where visions are possible, the mad theater of war. The most celebrated moment in the film is an actual vision, a poem he recites for an audience back home which has gathered to listen about life in the trenches.It is the rousing sight of the dead rising from the battlefield.Gance used for the scene 2000 soldiers who had come straight from Verdun and were due back eight days later. You have to appreciate the chilling significance of this. Gance was staging death for these people, and death that both parties could not have failed to know was a rehearsal for the real thing. Within weeks of their return, the majority of the soldiers were dead as presaged in the film.So death staged for an audience gathered round back home, at the behest of this poet - now raving mad - who conjures a vision of cinematic phantoms, the dead gaunt and in clutches and tatters getting up from shallow graves to march all the way back and haunt the living. They Accuse! ungrateful parents, wives, brothers, who have not honored the sacrifice.The maelstrom of self-reflexive notions was one of the most advanced things going on at the time, I was surprised really. Gance would go on to invent a new visual grammar with La Roue, and first inklings of that we see here in the rapid-fire cutting and agile camera in the battle scenes that reflect the anxious mobility tearing through Europe, that was really the fight for a modern world.", "A truly underrated gem if ever there was one, J'Accuse, which comes from now renowned film-maker Abel Gance, is a striking, powerful and deeply moving wartime drama that packs punches, dances with the roses and howls at the moon all in the course of 160 minutes. Now known for works that came in the decade following the first World War, Gance establishes himself here in 1919 as a director willing to learn from his peers and do one better. Indeed, audiences at the time were more than firmly on his side. \"Your name in England is, at present, more famous than Griffith's\", an anecdote that rings true after watching J'Accuse in its most readily complete form available today thanks to the brilliant work in collaboration by Flicker Alley, Turner Classic Movies and Lobster Films in doing a terrific job restoring the film to its rightful, stylised beauty on DVD and Blu-Ray.Set, produced and featuring actual footage shot on battlefields of World War I, Gance's seminal work here strives to do many things at once and while there are plenty who will argue he tries too much (or at least doesn't leave enough on the cutting room floor), I argue that with a few minor exceptions, J'Accuse is successful in its quest to marry poetry with war and terror with beauty, with a horizon that never seems to show itself. Sure, it's certainly guilty of being a bit overly-lofty at times. And yes, cutting back and forth between the film's two heavily-contrasted plots can be jarring, but I hardly think this was out of step with Gance's intentions. The film's theme essentially boils down to the blind getting in the way of each other and those lucky enough to have eyes thinking it best to ignore said unfortunates in order to get on with their own problems or indulgences in peace. By applying the juxtaposition of a serene, idyllic French countryside love-triangle against the harsh, cold grasp of war and death, the director sets up his idea, carries it forward and succeeds in bringing it to a very affecting close.I would be amiss in failing to mention two other key players in J'Accuse's success however, and those are cinematographer L\u00e9once-Henri Burel and the Robert Israel Orchestra who were commissioned for the restoration's soundtrack. Burel takes Gance's direction and runs with it. The battlefields are gloomy and frightening, the French countryside bright and warm to the eyes. Furthermore, whether it was under Burel's direction or not is unclear but, the film's various intertitle designs and abstract live-action imagery (the most striking perhaps occurring early on when family members prepare to leave their loved ones) make a profound emotional impact and showcase tonal photography techniques and styles not even Griffith had dreamed up yet, much of which is still utilised today in movies favouring mood and atmosphere. Lastly, the Robert Israel Orchestra punctuate Burel's photography with melancholic sweeping piano keys and piercing, wounded strings to round out one of the finest and most striking examples of silent-era cinema at its best.", "This film by Abel Gance was lost for many years but has now been restored from a number of sources and made available for viewing by the Nederlands Museum. Gance's later silent spectacular Napoleon is rightly revered for its innovation and inventiveness - but is the same true of his war epic, J'accuse?In three parts, this film is first a conventional love triangle between the tiresome and bullied Edith, her drunken husband Francois, and dreaming poet Jean. But when the great war strikes, it will affect them all in ways they can't imagine.With some great images, especially in parts one and two, and for the most part, restrained acting, J'accuse is a powerful plea against the waste of war. For a film made ninety years ago, it has a modern feel with numerous close-ups, overlays, and other camera tricks. Although a bit ponderous in places it does not flag and is still extremely watchable, and relevant in a world where war has not yet become a thing of the past.J'accuse deserves to be regarded highly, and shows Gance to have been a skilled and ahead-of-time filmmaker in the silent era.", "The 2006 restoration of this amazing 1919 film presents one of the very best opportunities to learn about the period from watching a contemporaneous film. Aesthetically, it stands on its own merit as a completely engaging and emotional piece, which on the whole deserves a much wider audience. The restoration drops whatever there was of a phony happy ending in the 1922 re-release, and adds an excellent score by Robert Israel. Israel scores are a quick tip that a silent film has been given a sensitive and elegant restoration that will be very palatable to modern tastes.The story is a complex family/romantic melodrama built around a poet in love with a woman trapped in a bad marriage to a violent man. With the war, the two men become comrades in arms, and complications ensue. (I really dislike reviews that go on and on telling the film's story. If someone is going to watch the movie, it is up to the director to tell the story in his own style and at his own pace.) I believe the film is mischaracterized as an anti-war film. No one is really for war, so a realistic film like this by a veteran and using real footage will include a lot of pathos that will serve the purpose of an anti-war message. But everyone is anti-war, the difference between a pro-war and and an anti-war film is that a pro-war film blames the war on the enemy and creates situations for nobility based on service of the just cause. An anti-war film turns the proponents of war into greedy liars, emphasizes the humanity of the enemy, and creates situations for nobility based on refusal to participate in the war. So defined, this piece (like The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse - 1921) is a pro-war film.", "I don't watch silent films quite as often as I should, but this one reminds me I should try harder once more. Most praises I've read about (this one), go out to the third and final act, which is absolutely understandable, but I was very impressed with the hour and fifty minutes before that also. How the relationship between Jean and Fran\u00e7ois changes was most impressively done, both by story and by acting (especially S\u00e9verin-Mars, who plays the latter, while Romuald Joub\u00e9 deserves special credit for his part in act three, when he loses his mind).This war- and love-story works on many levels. It deals with the horrors of war, but also how man (and woman and child) can overcome - though obviously not without scars. The part of the child that was conceived through rape is especially harrowing, but the love of Jean and Edith helps even the raging soldier Fran\u00e7ois to gain understanding of true love - though the scene in which the child must play a German soldier with the French kids is again hard to watch.The words 'J'accuse' return many times in the film, but who is really accused in the first part of the film? The war ministers in their safe retreats, one would say? When we witness one them being struck personally by a (war) tragedy, we must conclude no. The words 'I accuse' are more likely the perfectly logical way of expressing one's desire to blame someone - anyone - for all miseries that may come about in life; in war, \u00e1nd in love. When finally Jean looks out his window and blames the sun, this seems to substantiate that idea; it is an angry, desperate rant against a 'thing' which will burn no less when it is addressed. Of course I do not mean to dismiss here the part just before that, in which the returning dead army ghosts accuse their close ones of betrayal in various ways, but their accusations are instantly cathartic to all, and both the survivors and the dead may carry on. So, I'd like to doubt the reviews I've read about this film being anti-war, Abel Gance 'simply' seems to say that horrors of these kind had better be worth the while...? Just my two cents after this first viewing.Then there is an owl (symbol of the night) who acts as the prophet of war, someone resembling 'Ast\u00e9rix le Gaulois' as a symbol of bravery on the side of the French soldiers, beautiful visualizations of a book of poems called 'Les pacifiques', and so on. I can't say I fully understood all of it, but I did enjoy pretty much all of it; who is then really bothered when someone looks into the camera now and then (accidentally, I presume) or when there seem to be some wrongly cut short bits here and there (again, accidentally, I presume)? And, perhaps strangely, but it worked somehow, there is room for some humourImpressive, to say the least. A big 8 out of 10.", "I wish that we could read a comment from at least one of the 91 persons who gave a \"1\" rating to this silent film masterpiece. What were these 91 thinking? Do they hate all silents? Did they object to the length? If \"J'Accuse!\" is a \"1,\" why did they suffer through its almost three-hour duration? If they gave up watching after 10 minutes, why bother to vote and muck up the weighted average, now standing at an absurd 6.4? Thank you, Turner Classic Movies, for making \"J'Accuse\" available to a wide audience. That network is most capably helping fill the void left by the shutting down of most of America's repertory film theaters.", "J'Accuse (1919) :\nBrief Review -A Landmark in the Movie-Making! The Greatest French Film of All Time and Third Greatest Film of the Decade in World Cinema. I am saying it loud and clear that J'Accuse puts all War/Anti-War Classics at shame. Let's just go back to 1919 and have a look what we have got in Cinema World that can be called 'Masterpiece'. So, i see two D W Griffith films 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915) and 'Intolerance' (1916) on top of the table, but what's next or something on same the level to be compared coming from World Cinema? Here's the answer from French Cinema- 'J'Accuse'. If you are a real movie buff with a tremendous knowledge and great taste then i think you don't have to read the this review anymore. You must have understood what 'J'Accuse' is when i put it on a same level of those two Legendary films of Griffith. In addition i would like to mention one more thing that will increase the importance of this film even higher that, Abel Gance arranged the screening of this film for D W Griffith and the Legendary Film-maker was greatly moved by the film. Now tell me do you really need anything else? J'Accuse is story of two men, one married, the other the lover of the other's wife, who meet in the trenches of the World War I, and how their tale becomes a microcosm for the horrors of war. This is next level thinking when you put three extraordinary storylines in one narrative, War, Love Triangle and Anti-War. These are the elements who are individually enough to make one Classic film at a time and then you get to see all three combined in one film that means you actually get to see three classics at one time. Incredible, isn't it? For some time till the intermission i thought i am gonna witness the same legendary stuff like 'Casablanca' (1942) as the love triangle was shaping very well and the sacrifices were being made from both the sides and then suddenly in the third part it turned into a thought-provoking seminar which caused many people to change their behaviour in real life. I have seen many classic films based on War theme, Love Triangles, Sacrifice, Friendship, Anti-War concept and Thought-provoking material but i haven't seen any film which has all these properties combined together in one Cinematic Experience until i met J'Accuse. If you think i am exaggerating things then believe me i am not. I have watched more than 4000 films till date made between 1902 to 2021 and hardly 7-8 films have managed to get 10/10* rating and J'Accuse was about to become a new member of this rarest club.. but then i realised one or two things are missing and reduced that 1* mark. However, i wouldn't have mind to make J'accuse a Pride member of my 10/10* club but the couple of facts really needed a clarification. Rest, it has everything just perfect to whatever we call a 'Landmark Movie'. The two things i would like to counter are, one is the love triangle being little silly and messy and two is the continuation of it by all three characters even after having a great sense of reality. What more to talk, i don't know, i don't really have much to praise when i have already said that everything is just Perfect. Acting, writing, intertitles, cinematography, production design, socialism and direction everything is beyond greatness even when I consider it for today's time. Putting everything in brief, Third Greatest Film of the Decade in world Cinema and The Greatest French Film Ever made. Period.RATING - 9/10*By - #samthebestest", "With the French losing almost one and a half million soldiers during the Great War, some of France's citizens deliberated whether the great cost in lives was worth the loses. Included in that group was Abel Gance, who wrote and directed the first anti-war movie in cinema, April 1919's \"J'Accuse.\" The film, graphically displaying the carnage that took place over four years in his home country, was an instant classic and was heralded worldwide as accurately describing what shocks civilization sustained from 1914-1918.A bout with tuberculosis decided Gance's fate in the war when, after being drafted into the French Army, he was shortly discharged for the illness. During the tail end of the war, after hearing the sad stories from his friends on the Western Front, he yearned to produce a movie about the trials they went through--as well as those of civilians far behind the battle lines. He received funding from Pathe, which became surprised at Gance's astronomical final production costs. But in the end, the box office success throughout continental Europe as well as D. W. Griffith's, who had viewed the film and was so impressed by it, control of its lucrative United States distribution, the film studio made an enormous profit from \"J'Accuse.\"To give the movie its authenticity, Gance re-enlisted in the French Army in its Section Cin\u00e9matographique and filmed portions of the September 1918 Battle of Saint-Mihiel with the United States Army. His footage interweaves with other portions in the last third of \"J'Accuse,\" which focuses on the front lines of the war.As critics have pointed out, the first two-thirds play out as a melodrama, introducing the main protagonists, two men vying for the love of Edith, who is married to one of them, an abusive, jealous husband. The poet, who can be Gance in disguise, is the other, a pacifist who has been discharged from service due to illness. Ask if \"J'Accuse' is more a pacifist film than an anti-war one, Gance replied, \"I'm not interested in politics... But I am against war, because war is futile. Ten or twenty years afterward, one reflects that millions have died and all for nothing. One has found friends among one's old enemies, and enemies among one's friends.\"\nThe two love interests of Edith end up comrades on the front when the poet re-enlists. Several sequences in that last third of the movie stick in viewers' minds: the soldiers, during a lull, write letters to loved ones at home (these are actual letters written by battle-hardened soldiers); the phantom of death walking among the soldiers preparing for an assault; and the recreated hand-to-hand encounters between the two opposing armies.The \"J'Accuse's\" highlight, and the one studied in film schools today, is the \"March of the Dead\" sequence towards the film's conclusion. Gance was able to get two thousand French soldiers on leave to volunteer their time in acting as corpses from the battles rising from the ground. In what can be technically termed as the first depiction of zombies walking among the living (except these dead aren't the flesh-eating ones), \"L'Accuse\" shows the soldiers walking to the local village where they judge whether their death was worth their ultimate sacrifice. Hearing about a few scattered profiteers who unscrupulously made large sums of money from the war, these soldiers deliberate on the villagers' fates. Gance noted that out of the 2,000 soldiers in the film returning to the front, 80% became casualties in the last months of the war.Film historians claim Gance's \"J. Accuse\" was 10 years ahead of his time with his unique lighting illustrating the French Impressionistic moods of delving deep into the emotions of the movie's characters, and his use of mobile camera movements. The financial success of the 1919 film allowed the director to produce even more ambitious movies in the future such as 1923's \"La Roue\" and 1927's \"Napoleon.\" Gance even made an later talking film called \"L'Accuse\" in 1938, warning on the tensions developing as a prelude to World War Two.", "It's hard to describe the images you will see in this film.  They cut to the very core of the most horrific results of war.  It is a fantasy which will leave you with images that will not leave you.Any mention of the particulars here might spoil the experience of this great silent offering.", "In connection with the showing at this German Count's private cinema of the film \"Mater Dolorosa\" (1917) by Herr Gance some months ago, this Teutonic aristocrat had praised and even eulogized the good film work of this important and essential French film director. \"Mater Dolorosa\", with its superb cinematographic technique, was a great definitive leap forward in Herr Gance's career.\"J'Accuse!\" confirms aristocratic suspicions about Herr Gance's ability. Because it's without any doubt another great film in which those pioneer cinematographic techniques mentioned before are carried out. Again an excellent example of technical experimentation to achieve a film narrative, J'Accuse is superbly developed\u0085 achieving an unquestionable masterpiece.\"J'Accuse!\", besides it's perfect technique, is an emotive antiwar message filmed during the I World War great disaster and with wounds still open. It's a film that denounces the absurdity of war, its uselessness and the terrible consequences that society suffers. It demands the viewer to take note of the great sacrifices and injustices of many broken lives that never will be the same through the fault of the war.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count when mentioning those old wars plenty of lost battles, is slightly Teutonic.", "Last Saturday -- December 12, 2009 -- was the actual North American premier of this wonderful film in its entirety at the winter edition of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival. The Nederlands Filmmuseum and Lobster Films' fine efforts have resulted in a restoration of the European release print as Abel Gance intended for the movie to be seen; indeed, as it was seen in France and Britian in 1919. They combined six different prints including one original camera negative and one print with original tinting to produce a truly stunning cinematic triumph. I, as many of you have, had seen the version edited for American release, but this print simply took my breath. It is rich and full. The additional material fully advances the narrative. Gance's strident message of the uselessness and futility of war comes to full flower and is even more disturbing than was evident from earlier,incomplete releases. The expanded performances of Severin-Mars, Marise Dauvray, and Romuald Joube fill in the previous gaps in the story. Young and pretty Angele Guys is all the more angelic in this version which includes the heartbreaking taunting she receives at the hands of playmates when they discover she is the bastard product of a German soldiers' gang rape. Gance's use of quick-cutting and montage presages that of Eisenstein and with this release it is even more apparent that Gance was certainly one of the handful of early pioneering geniuses of the cinema. All in all this restoration is truly wonderful. If you don't have the recently released DVD in your library, you do not have a complete collection of the greatest silent films. As I've written before on these pages, if you've never attended the San Francisco Silent Film Festival you are -- as our teachers used to say --only cheating yourself! It is very well run and held in the Castro Theater, a beautifully preserved movie palace. The Festival is indeed one of the premier film events in the world.", "As is true of cinema generally, some silent films put trust in a fluidity of storytelling more closely resembling what modern viewers are familiar with following the advent of talkies; some especially concern themselves with detail and nuance in scenes to enrich the experience. This title isn't specifically lacking in either regard, but it strikes me that filmmaker Abel Gance above all approached his magnum opus with a mind for stark, unblinking imagery to propel his story with heavy, emphatic beats. Not every movie could necessarily adopt that tack and make it work, but with the purity of Gance's vehemence comes a poignancy in discrete scenes that might fall flat elsewhere. Thus are glimpses of tranquility, memories of another time, juxtaposed with mobilization, or death; what scenes of wartime violence lack in absolute grisly realism, the make up for with an air of grim, despairing isolation. Still images, overlaid tricks of the camera or editing, and words or ideas portending nastier business that the lens would not dare show all raise a specter of inevitable gloom; happier times feel like waiting for the other shoe to drop. Every notion of the plot, and every emotion, from love, friendship, and hope to hatred, fear, and hollowness, are painted with broad strokes. Yet those strokes form a tableau that is no lesser for it, not least given the breadth and scope of the feature - and certainly, too, in light of the unflinching zealousness with which Gance uses his picture to lash out in the face of deep-seated outrage at the madness of war. 'J'accuse' may tower at a little less than three hours in length, yet for the potency of its tale and its craft, those three hours pass quickly.In some small measure I think the narrative is a tad imbalanced between the romantic drama binding Jean, Francois, and Edith together, and the conflict that looms large in the background. The two aspects aren't entirely given equal treatment, to the point that the film comes across for much of its duration as being more about the drama away from the battlefield. Then again, in fairness, one part intrinsically informs the other, and Gance obviously had loftier intentions. As much as this is a movie about war, it's more broadly about the passions and violence of the human heart - all the great wonders they can achieve, and also the great horrors, destroying lives in myriad terrible ways. Moreover, just as the saga of the home front becomes more engrossing (and dour) over time, in the last stretch depictions of the war front are increasingly gnarly and distressing. Layered with accents of humanity, and primed with our knowledge of the realities of World War I and of the background of the production, the last act of 'J'accuse' is more powerful and impactful than what many, many other war movies (or even movies of other genres) in all the past one hundred years have been able to accomplish. And where Gance does take the time to broach a moment with a more delicate, minutely calculated hand, well, the intended effect is only amplified. As writer and director the man unmistakably had a sweeping, far-reaching vision, and for as relatively straightforward as the story is it nevertheless plumbs depths that seem rare for not just the silent era but perhaps the film industry at large. It's a lot to take in, but the profit as a viewer is momentous.From the iconic opening scene in which the name is displayed, to the extended sequence at the end that drives home with unfettered animus Gance's boiling ire, 'J'accuse' is an extraordinary, captivating viewing experience. And it benefited from the utmost skill and attentive ardor from everyone who participated in its creation. The editing and cinematography are extra sharp at select points; particularly (but not exclusively) in the most grandiose of instances, Gance's orchestration of shots and scenes is plainly masterful. The production design and art direction are very easy on the eyes; the hair, makeup, and costume design are sometimes less so, but only in the best and most meaningful of ways. The use of soldiers as extras, and footage captured on the real-life battlefront, are gratifying as a cinephile and make the movie all the more vivid; those effects and stunts that are employed look just as swell. Of course none of this is to count out the cast, whose performances are characterized by considerable range, poise, physicality, and even nuance. Naturally Romuald Joub\u00e9, S\u00e9verin-Mars, and Maryse Dauvray stand out most, each getting plentiful opportunity in turn to demonstrate their acting abilities, but all others appearing before the camera contribute just as much to what the title ultimately represents. It's readily apparent that all on hand believed wholly in what Gance was doing, and that shared passion produced tremendous results in every capacity.What more is there to say? I can understand why older films don't appeal to all modern viewers. I firmly believe this picture far surpasses any such qualifications, however, and the immensity of its storytelling and craft is so absorbing and compelling that any passing thoughts bent toward subjective criticism easily melt away. The themes and ideas herein are sadly, infuriatingly all too relevant even one century later, and the feature resonates with a thrumming, undeniable electricity and emotional reach. It's a lot to sit through, in more regards than one, but well worth the time and effort it takes to watch. 'J'accuse' is an outstanding, revered classic, and deserves far greater recognition and remembrance."], "tt0010323": ["Made in 1919, \"The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari\" was literally years ahead of its time and remains a triumphant accomplishment in the genre of German Expressionism. Remembered mainly for its stunning sets, which featured crooked buildings and twisted landscapes, \"Cabinet\" also boasts one of the first attempts at a twist ending, something quite new and shocking for its time.Told mainly from the point of view of Francis, a young man who lives in the small village of Holstenwall, Germany, \"Cabinet\" tells the tale of murder and madness which seems to accompany the arrival of a carnival. Francis and his best friend Alan go to the carnival and are presented with the sideshow attraction Cesare the Somnambulist, a gaunt and hideous young man who spends his life sleeping in a coffin-like cabinet and seems able to predict the future when awake. Cesare (played by a young Conrad Veidt, who later went on to play the evil Nazi general in Casablanca) informs Alan that he will soon die, and indeed, Alan is found murdered the next morning. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange keeper, a man called Caligari. As Francis desperately tries to solve the mystery and find his friends killer, it seems that the beautiful young Jane, beloved by both Alan and Francis, has been targeted as the next victim.This is a genuinely creepy film which delves deep into the mysteries of the abnormal mind...an uncomfortable journey to say the least. Everyone is suspect and, in the end, we must ask ourselves: \"who is really the mad one here?\"Subtle and ingenious, we see the world the way an insane person might see it; warped and confused, a nightmarish terrain where nothing makes sense and balance is not to be found.The impact of this film is still being felt and seen today, and for good reason. It is a shocking, disturbing masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.", "Like so many of the films from the silent era, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari gets overlooked (if you can even find it!) for big budget duds, and runny romantic comedies. Directors of the period like Griffith, Lang, Eisenstien, and Caligari's Wiene, are never given the credit they deserve. And if credit is given, it is in small cultish circles in various pockets around the world.The set design here is amazing, not a single right angle can be found in any one of the sets. This may not only apply to the disjointed and distorted characters in the film, but also the state of Germany at the time. After all, the film was made in the dark ages in Germany between WWI and WWII. This point is validated by Siegfried Kracauer, with his notion of how the main character of Dr. Caligari can be easily interpreted to Hitler, and vice versa. Both controlled subjects with a form of \"brainwashing\", both were upset with current forms of society and government, and both were masters of deception. In a period where Germans were looking for direction, and let's face it, authority as well, Dr. Caligari embodied it fully.In the area of the players, all the names in the film turn out a literally \"speechless\" performance. Dagover, Krau\u00df, and especially Veidt as Cesare (pronounced Chez-a-ray) are excellent in the use of gestures and motion to get their point across without using words. The camera, stationary as in most early features, uses the mise-en-scene effectively, letting us identify with characters such as Francis and Jane, and disjointing us from Caligari, and the Criminal.The use of lines and stripes, not only in the sets but in small places like in the good doctor's hair and on his gloves, adds to the telling of the character. Colour tints of the B&W film also play a special part in bringing the whole film together. An amazing sequence where Caligari reveals his true madness, pits Caligari stumbling through the unequal streets of Germany while being haunted by textual ramblings written in the air. A marvelous achievement for it's time. And it adds so much.The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari has changed the way I look at horror films, and even films in general. I urge anyone reading this to pick up this film. The DVD offering is utterly fantastic with the restored print, an audio essay of the film, and production notes. Bypass the overblown \"motion picture events of the year\", and pick up Caligari, quite possible the greatest motion picture event in the history of motion pictures.", "I know this film is a masterpiece, one of the most influential films ever made and a prime example of German expressionism. And the sets still look amazing. But compared to some other silent films from the same period, I think Das Cabinet is a bit of a slow movie at times. Sometimes this work to maximize the tension, such as the scene where Cesare sneaks up to the girl. But most of the time it makes this 114 minutes film feel longer than the 2,5 hours of Intolerance (made around the same time). It is a must see classic, just a bit too slow for my part.", "With a story as twisted, buckled and demented as the scenery and set design, and a tortured score to boot, was the lunatic in charge of the asylum? Must have been a moment to remember coming across this cinematic marvel back in 1920. I wonder how many of today's pieces of cinema will stand the test of 100 years, albeit with a lot more competition.", "It struck me last night that I've never seen a serious silent film. Everyone's seen a silent comedy: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Keystone Cops... They've all been immortalized in the minds of every film viewer, and I enjoy them as much as anyone. But it seems a strange and almost disrespectful lack to never have seen anything but comedy; so many silent films were created, and the only ones I've seen starred waddling tramps.It was partially for that reason that I rented this movie. I had read about it on a film review site (the name of which escapes my memory) and decided it was worth the half-hour drive to the video store. The basic premise is that of a man relating a story that happened to him and his friends - their unnerving discovery of a crazed mountebank, Dr. Caligari, and his prophetic sleepwalker. It follows a series of murders and growing madness, keeping you in constant suspense and confusion until the very last scene.There's a period of adjustment when watching it - unfortunately necessary for a modern audience. The titles seem too slow. The camera seems to hold on scenes too long. The makeup on the actors' faces seem ghostly and horrible - even on the hero.But before long, the movie has you in its grip. You spend time staring at the architecture - buildings, doors, and windows that would have been funny in a Dr. Seuss book. In the film, they make you uneasy. The whole atmosphere is of a world gone wrong; like a dream worthy of Salvador Dal\u00ed. Nothing is square or straight. The buildings loom in on you; windows sweep upward, slanted or curved; doors are obscenely angled holes beckoning you to enter and be trapped inside.Throughout, the story defies expectations. Small plot twists confuse and mislead you until the final surprise, completely tearing down everything you thought the movie was about. Strange shadows and shots from inside alleys paint the film's world as something terrible, never allowing you a normal look at the village, never allowing you to enjoy the quaintness of it. Through it all, the grinning, hunched figure of Dr. Caligari hangs in your mind, pushing out rational thought.The movie is well worth your time; there's a certain pleasure in trying to capture the feeling of terror an early audience, unaccustomed to the visual effects we see every day, would have had the first time they saw this movie. It's an intellectual terror in the grand old style, giving you the same thrill you get from reading Frankenstein or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. At the risk of sounding clich\u00e9: two thumbs up!", "Francis (Friedrich Feher) and an old man are sitting and Francis begins to tell him a story, hoping to top the one the man just told him. The story is about a fair that came to his hometown of Hostenwall and a man, Dr. Caligari who was one of the vendors. Caligari's submission to the fair is his somnambulist, Cesare (Conrad Veidt) who has been asleep for 25 years and, under Dr. Caligari's willing, is about to awaken. He does and Dr. Caligari tells the crowd to ask him a question, for he knows the future. Francis is there with his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), and Alan walks up and asks Cesare how long he'll live, to which Cesare replies that he'll be dead by dawn.Alan and Francis both long for the same woman, Jane (Lil Dagover) and after they all three go home, we see, inside Alan's house, the shadows of he and his killer fighting on his bedroom wall. Francis goes to tell the police after he realizes the somnambulist's prophecy has come true. Back at Dr. Caligari's place, we see him feeding gruel to Cesare as he lay in a coffin. Another attempted murder takes place but turns out to be the work of a common crook not involved with Cesare and Dr. Caligari. More happens that's not really important. Francis goes to an insane asylum to see if the fled Dr. Caligari is a patient there but the worker he speaks with tells him he must go see the head of the institute for patient information, as he's not allowed to divulge that sort of thing. So Francis goes to the head's office (a skeleton stands upright in the corner) and it turns out to be Dr. Caligari himself.Francis gets the police over there and after looking through his books, they discover a historical book about the mythical Caligari, who did just what Dr. Caligari is doing now, back in 1093. When Dr. Caligaru arrives he goes insane, saying he must become Caligari and doctors in the institute put him in a straight jacket. Then the telling of the story is done. The film adds a framing device, though, in the present with Francis and the man he's told the story to.The two go back to the institute, Cesare is in the corner and Francis warns the old man not to accept one of his prophesies, for he should surely die. Jane is there also, and when Francis asks her to marry him, she says she cannot marry someone not of royal blood (huh?). Then down the stairs comes Dr. Caligari, whom Francis quickly gets in a scuffle with. He's grabbed by the doctors and taken upstairs. Dr. Caligari comes to the conclusion that Francis is manic and that his mania is caused by his delusion that Dr. Caligari is in fact the mythic Caligari who would wander from town to town with Cesare killing townsfolk. The last scene is of Dr. Caligari saying he has a sure-fire cure for Francis' mania.So was Francis the real Caligari? Did Francis kill Alan in the hopes of getting Jane to marry him? (After all, we never do see his killer.) With this appended narrative twist, the entire story comes into question. I have a feeling a lot of people would hate this but I found it very interesting, maybe even historic.The film is very dreamlike. All silent films are sort of spooky, but this one is more otherworldly. Everything is distorted and the camera, with that strange blackening, gives it an unstable touch like our most vivid dreams have. It's like something's been placed over the lens in order to highlight certain characters or visuals and cover up something else. I'm assuming the film used on-set camera tricks.The expressionist sets consist of slanted walls, crooked doors, weirdly misshapen glasses, paint splashed on stairs that bend. A background that is clearly a wall with painting. Trees that look like wires. The characters' faces are all pale white and the blacks are all stark. Cesare, specifically, looks like a cross between Frankenstein's Monster and Edward Scissorhands. The houses don't look like houses, they look like pieces of wood painted to look like a stage set.I can see influence from this film in the set designs of Tim Burton especially, and the narrative twist at the end must have influenced David Lynch in \"Mulholland Drive.\"The print I saw was from 1992 and for a movie that's 83 years old, I was very impressed. There was very little grain and the lighting was fine. The only complaint I had was that some of the handwriting from Dr. Caligari's writings was a bit difficult to read and that has nothing to do with the print. The music is all organ that comes booming in whenever something evil -- usually Dr. Caligari -- is onscreen.It's hard to judge movies like these, but the visuals are wonderful, the music is spooky, the acting suitable and the pacing fine (it's a little over an hour). I would say this is an essential film, and unlike many \"groundbreaking\" classics, it's like nothing else you've seen.***1/2", "A young man, Francis (Friedrich Feher), recounts the story of Dr. Caligari, proprietor of a unique fairground sideshow: Cesare, the somnambulist. When the fair arrives in the town of Holstenwall, it marks the beginning of a series of brutal murders. Is the mysterious Caligari responsible, waking his sleeping attraction and sending him into the night to kill?At the risk of sounding like a philistine, I think that Robert Wiene's silent horror classic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari drags a tad too much. There's no denying the occasional brilliance of its expressionist set design and the ingenuity of the surprise revelation at the end (almost 70 years before Shyalaman made twist endings his thing), but I believe that the story would have been better suited to a shorter runtime. Wiene has a tendency to linger on scenes, and while this admittedly gives the viewer more opportunity to drink in his bizarre, angular visuals, it also allows boredom to set in.If you're a dedicated horror nut, I'd say that watching the film is a no-brainer, worth a go if only to witness iconic imagery such as Cesare (Conrad Veidt) carrying woman-in-peril Jane Olsen (Lil Dagover) over the town's zig-zagging rooftops. Just expect to be a little underwhelmed and a tad stupefied by the film as a whole.", "This 1920 film gets extra points for originality. A young man, Francis, tells a stranger an odd tale of a carnival man, Dr. Caligari, who comes to town to show the locals his \"somnambulist\", Cesare. Cesare has been asleep for twenty-five years and only comes awake on the command of Dr. Caligari. Cesare sleeps in a cabinet resembling a casket. During the show, Francis wakes the somnambulist. Cesare then answers questions from the audience and predicts the future.When Francis' best friend, Alan, asks jokingly how long he, Alan, will live, Cesare answers, \"The time is short. You die tomorrow.\" Big joke -- except that Alan is stabbed dead during the night, just one of several mysterious murders that have taken place since Dr. Caligari and his infernal cabinet waltzed into town.I don't know how much I want to get into the plot itself. The ending isn't really predictable, so let's just say Francis manages to convince the police that Caligari and his somnambulist are responsible for the murders and there is a chase.However, the first thing one notices about the film is not the characters, all of whom overact according to the standards of silent movies -- and Cecil B. DeMille's sound movies.After Francis launches into his tale, what one notices are the sets. This is one cockeyed world that he and his friends inhabit. It's a cartoon world. These are all indoor sets that seem built of plywood. The backdrop is a complicated suggestion of a mountain with a village on its slopes, but it's sloppily drawn, like the rest of the decorations, as if by a child with a set of finger paints. The carousel at the fair spins at 45 degrees from plumb. What passes for streets, buildings, roofs, chimneys, and interiors are all drunkenly askew, leaning this way and that, each on its own trip and totally indifferent to the leanings of others. One might say there isn't a right angle in the joint. I've never seen anything like it.The characters, their dress and grooming, fit right into this insane landscape. When we are first introduced to Cesare, when Caligari opens the door of the upright casket, we're treated to a close up of Conrad Veidt's face with its black eye shadow and the thin glossy smear of what looks like paste across his thin lips. And when he opens his eyes, it's pretty spooky -- the equal of Karloff's monster when he first appears and slowly shuffles around toward the camera. Caligari himself is adorned with an unruly aura of white hair and thick, goggle-like eyeglasses. He wears white gloves with three thin black strips on the back, just like Mickey Mouse.It might be possible to argue that this is expressionism for expressionism's sake -- but that's not the case. The framing story takes place in sets that more closely resemble the world that you and I are familiar with. The Boschian garden of earthly delights in which most of the story takes place is as crazy as it is for a good reason, which I can't explain here.There's no other film quite like it. Expressionism been pretty influential over the years, but the dark shadows and crooked streets of most later films are only dry, dead leaf echoes of this original.", "I vowed to see more horror films this year, and this was recommended to me, initially I was a little dubious with it being a hundred plus years old, and a silent film, but I have to say I have a real appreciation for it.Without a doubt, this film must be the inspiration for the whole horror genre, a genre that scares and shocks people to this day, you can only I shine the profound effect that this film must have had on viewers back in its time.Hugely atmospheric and creepy, if I'm honest, it is slow, and you do need to concentrate, or you'll lose it, no texting or phone play, it is a fairly intense watch, best of all is the ending, which really does come as a surprise, it's something of a twist.It is definitely not for everyone, and if you're used to modern horror, you may find ten minutes of it an arduous task, but having watched Nose earlier in the year, I have a real appreciation for this early gem.An admirable film, 8/10.", "Spoilers herein.Most commentors remark on the `expressionist' sets and lighting. But these in fact were already common in contemporary stage productions, and just represented here as if they were stage sets. It is true that these have odd angles. But notice how the camera is always rectilinear: stationary, it shoots straight from eye level. That part isn't novel at all. The consciousness of the camera as a character comes from Eisenstein.But what is novel is the framing device which is the first example I know which plays with the veracity of the film's eye. And in THIS respect, the film is important. It is the progenitor of many experiments in folded, shifting narrative from `Rashomon' to `Mullholland Drive.'", "Many people consider \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" the first horror movie ever made, and I don't feel tempted to debate that. It all begins when Alan and Jane go to a carnival. They go to Dr. Caligari's (Werner Krauss) booth. He has a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who can predict the future. His prediction that Alan will die proves accurate when the latter is found murdered.Who is the perpetrator is not the important point. The movie, incredible beyond anything imaginable, relies heavily on surrealism and the depths of the mind. It is one of the many great movies produced in Germany during that country's Weimar era. You will walk away from this movie questioning everything that you've ever known and ever been taught.", "\"The Cabinet of Dr Caligari\" is upheld as one of cinema's greats, and in a number of regards, I can understand why. It is hauntingly beautiful and wonderfully stylised. It's Expressionistic cinematography is wonderful and suspenseful; it's no wonder that this film has influenced many subsequent directors and producers many years later.However, whilst it surely wouldn't have seemed like this back in 1920, it is rather boring through contemporary eyes. I'm sorry if this makes me sound ignorant, but today it plays rather slow-paced and un-scary, even compared to some of the other greats of Weimar cinema (such as \"Nosferatu\").Not a bad film by any means (I would recommend it), but \"Caligari\" seems more something of historical value and academic study to me.", "As someone who appreciates silent film and films in the Expressionist style(think FW Murnau), I simply love The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. True, to some people the acting may seem exaggerated and some of the movements stilted. However I felt these added well to the paranoid and sometimes weird(in a wonderfully strange way) atmosphere and also to the titular character psychopathic state of mind. Werner Krauss is the epitome of creepiness as Caligari and Conrad Veidt also makes a memorable impression. The story is interesting, and Robert Wiene directs beautifully. But it is the way it was made that makes The Cabinet of Dr Caligari so unique and a milestone of its genre. The scenery is appropriately sumptuous and their lopsidedness added further to the atmosphere, while the camera work, sometimes deliberately odd, is the best aspect. In conclusion, a great film and a milestone. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the \"total work of art,\" or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.This film is best seen at night, alone, and with the modern soundtrack which is available on the fully restored version. If the DVD you're watching does not have (a) choice of two soundtracks (traditional music and much-scarier modern track), (b) tinted inter-titles set in a surrealistic (actually expressionistic) font, and (3) is fairly high quality, then send it back and get the restored version. The quality and completeness of silent films are a major factor in experiencing the art form as it was meant to be experienced. The modern sound track in Dr. Caligari makes the film much more accessible for modern audiences (the eerie effects in the modern track heighten the feel of the film for the modern viewer) - try both tracks, you'll see.It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.Anyway, I think the film is best viewed with NO NOTICE. You don't really want to know the plot (the meaning of the end of the film can be interpreted in radically different ways - keep that in mind when it happens). Only one note - artistically the German Expressionist movement is worth reading about after you see the film - you'll notice the theme of \"death and the maiden\" woven into this artwork. Also, this film is the direct ancestor of films like \"Nightmare Before Christmas\" and a lot more - you'll recognize the Expressionist look in many presentations in television and film.WARNING - I would NOT show this film to children. It's very subtly and psychologically undermining - you'll be thinking and freaking about this thing for months to come - such a thing shouldn't be experienced by children - it's an adult, art film (no, not that kind) made for adults.", "Having only started discovering silent movies recently, I don't have more than a handful of other non-talkies to compare it to. This however was not only one of the best, most compelling and unique silents I have seen, but also a great flick overall. It's all been said before, I'm sure, but I'll say it again: this is a milestone of German Expressionist cinema. It is also a class-A mind-phuck movie (excuse my French), one of those stories that'll leave you eternally scratching your head trying to figure out what you've seen, what to believe and what can be a plausible explanation for most of the creepy mysteries you've just witnessed. Right from the very opening scene, seemingly suspended in an otherworldly dimension, maybe somewhere in between life and death, in which the first line spoken is: \"There are spirits everywhere\", you realise you are in for a spooky ride (this is the ultimate Halloween movie, come to think of it!) Having studied theatre set and costume design at Rome's art school for a year before going to university, I was obviously completely fascinated by the set design choices here. Buildings and furniture, props and painted backdrops are elongated and deformed into blocky, savage, expressionistic, perspective-defying and proportion-less forms. Even the intertitles weren't of the traditional sort. The result is obviously one of unsettling the viewer further into believing themselves suspended in a reality where anything could happen - anything horrible or nightmarish, obviously. Nothing is as it seems, right to the very end. Btw, on a more frivolous note, I thought the character of Cesare the Somnambulist looked uncannily like something that might have influenced Tim Burton into creating Edward Scissorhands, or maybe even more, the look of some of the characters in Rocky Horror Picture Show.", "The original message of this film is fairly pedestrian (an outcry against the weak authority in Germany at the time), although the political intrigue surrounding the production led to a fascinating framing story which re-established \"the authorities,\" and in turn made the UFA happy enough to distribute the film. This suggests that in its own time the political message of the film was fairly powerful, but compared to the work done in such films as The Golem, Nosferatu, and Metropolis it is not so far-reaching.What sets this film apart from its contemporaries is its absolute commitment to the expressionist movement. Mutated sets, heavy dark/light makeup, light and shadow, and a Gothic storyline are classic expressionism. The photography is beautiful and so crisp that it creates an eerie sense that this hellish scene is actually the real world, and that our everyday lives are the delusional Technicolor dream of a madman.While there are many better movies made in this period, I feel that this one is the pinnacle of the imagery that is characteristic of the expressionist art form. It is an absolute must-see for anyone who is interested in the Expressionist movement.", "Oh what a tangled web the world of the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is. It may all be sane in the focus of a madman, or it may just all take place in a crazy world. We see this story in the context of a guy telling a story to his friend or someone on a bench- following the sight of a 'spirit', perhaps, drifting by, a woman in a white dress who is in a complete daze. The story is that of what we would assume is Dr. Caligari, who in a town that could easily be called a geometrical nightmare (all those shapes and curves!), goes to a fair with his own exhibit: a Somnambulist, a person who has been asleep for quite a long time and is just about to be awoken. The question he's asked is right to the point, and the response is too: \"When will I die\" \"Tomorrow at dawn.\" This is not just a cryptic message, we see, as people start to be killed by a mysterious murderer, brought on (or just directly because of) the doctor and his Somnambulust.This is basically the story, and it's a very good one, even a great one in its dimensions of a mad scientist and his quarry. And of course when we suddenly get that great big twist (or is it a twist?) at the end, it gives the rest of the film a whole other perspective to read into. But what you go to see the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is not for the story, per-say, but for its unique perspective as a work of cinema. Despite the imitations, and despite (or in spite) or those who would dare to be inspired by the work (Tim Burton springs to mind without a flinch), it stands tall as a mammoth work - surprising since it's only 70 minutes long - by creating its own view of humanity and the world, of the way a civilization and houses and roads and places can or should or would ever look, and giving its own characters a mood of dread and the Gothic. If you ever need to drag someone to show them how to get \"fantastical\" with a set, this is it.Robert Wiene, along with being a competent storyteller, is just a superb director of his actors in these sets. While it would be a little much for me to go on and on about how glorious the staging is within these seemingly un-navigable roads, and how the walls sometimes seem to be closing in or giving an extra edge that you only get in a nightmare, its important to note how well the actors come off here. It's because of them, as much as Wiene and his crew (Willy Hameister especially), that one will remember Dr. Caligari long after it ends. One such example is just seeing Conrad Veidt, as the somnambulist, awaken the first time in front of the audience - it's so chilling and gradual that it draws one in completely, and looking in Cesare's eyes becomes all the more frightening. In fact, it's hard to tell which actor gives off the more horrifying aura: the scientist (Krauss, with a great crazy head of hair and catalog of evil facial expressions) or Veidt's cool demeanor.Another scene I should mention, which is simply one of the greatest scenes ever filmed and should be seen by anyone with a pulse: it's when Cesare, after seeing Jane Olsen come into the doctor's place to try to find her father and the two make bizarre eye contact, drifts into her bedroom at night. There's the contrast of dark and light, white and black, for one thing to note, how staggering everything is lit and staged in this setting, and with the walls and windows off-kilter and deranged. Then there's the body language of Veidt as he comes up to the window and into the bedroom towards Dagover - it's seemingly supernatural, out of this world, but still in it, which gives it a whole other dimension. And then the shock of when she awakens, which gives the scene full-blown suspense and danger. I would watch this scene over and over, though it's not the only one that would continually fascinate.Cabinet of Dr. Caligari doesn't carry the same weight of its director's name as Murnau or Lang in German cinema (sadly, Wiene made only a handful of other films seen outside of his native country), but with one film and its standing in the expressionist movement (or, I would also add, surrealist to the degree of its importance in dream/nightmare cinema) it's just as important, and potent today. Watch it in the dark, and hopefully not alone.", "This picture is a masterpiece ! How could someone think in something like this at that time ? The film has really good casting ! Werner Krauss is excellent playing Doctor Caligari and Conrad Veidt (Cesare) too !This movie has an obscure and bizarre mood makes the film looks really scary sometimes ... The painted scenario gave the film the touch that it needed ! It puts you in a nightmarish world , gives you the sensation of claustrofobia , depression and madness ! The objects have a strange shape and an irregular geometry that collaborate for the maintenance of the dark mood !But the most important thing in this motion picture is the open ended story ! You\u00b4re never sure about the end ! It has so many ways of interpretation... It\u00b4s useless to try to define \"one end\" to this movie. You\u00b4ll be always asking yourself about the legitimacy of the man\u00b4s vision of the story.It\u00b4s not scary , just sometimes , as I said. But it\u00b4s dark and it uses the shadows and lights effects so well that I was amazed the first time I saw and I still amazed ! German Films of that time were really good !Congratulations to Robert Wienne and his cast ! It\u00b4s a masterpiece of madness and paranoia!Rating : *****/******", "World War One sent a shockwave through the arts and one of the results was expressionism. The term is difficult to define; in a general sense, however, it refers to a type of art that makes a statement about internal emotion and psychology. Often linked to surrealism and cubism, in the 1920s expressionism became one of the dominate styles in visual and performing arts and was particularly associated with Germany.The 1919 THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is perhaps the only film made in a purely expressionist style. As directed by Robert Wiene and designed by Herman Warm, Walter Reimann, and Walter Rohrig, everything about the film is exaggerated, off-center, and disorienting. The sets are strange, deliberately artificial constructions of flat surfaces in odd angles and broad strokes of paint; the make-up and costumes are equally exaggerated. The result is a unique look that has the paranoid essence of nightmare, and the story links with the visuals to remarkable effect.A carnival has come to a small German town, and among its attractions is Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) and \"sonambulist\" Cesare (Conrad Veidt). When awakened from his sleep, Cesarea makes predictions of the future--predictions of death! And through his power over the sleepwalker, Caligari ensures that the predictions come true. It is frequently described as the first true horror film. But while the story was shocking by 1919 standards, it was really the visual style of the film that outraged critics and the public alike; many described it as \"degenerate,\" and it proved extremely controversial where ever shown.It also proved incredibly influential--so much so that it is virtually impossible for any one serious about film as art to avoid it. But there are quite a few releases that you should avoid: the film is in public domain, and the result has been a series of DVD and VHS \"budget\" releases that are dire to the nth degree. It is a matter of getting what you pay for, and while the KINO release is the most expensive print available, it is also the only one worth having. The picture quality is as good as it can be short of digital restoration and the film has been restored to its original tints as well.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "This is the way movies should have always been done, right from the start until now.I first saw this film 1 year ago. I bought it on DVD based on recommendations of a respected A/V magazine, since they said it represented \"the best transfer to DVD from a B/W movie we have ever seen\". So I expected to calibrate my tv set with it, and to stash it with the other DVDs I never watch.But from the beginning, I was hooked. Why was everything so normal, then imagery became so... astounding? The first minutes of the film were crucial, since I really began to see that these movie was trying so hard to convey a meaning far beyond that of being an expressionist film. So I followed, and followed. And marveled at the weird angles, incredible set design, and at the story that was unfurling on screen. A feeling of nervousness began by the second half of the movie, since (I think) the sets had worked their magic on my imagination, and I was sucked deep into the movie. And when I thought the movie was over.... there was an ending any modern movie would love to achieve. Terrific!Watching the running commentary only made things even better, since every detail and nuisance was explained, tracing paralels with Germany of the 1920's, and exploring the motivation and inner workings of every character. What a movie!Highly recommended for late night viewing. Not a movie for watching with friends, though. This movie is like the finest of the fine wines: sip it alone, at your own pace, and you will find it well worth the price of admission.", "This film is a must-see for lovers of silent cinema and is the first great film of the horror genre. That does not mean it was the first. While among the earliest horror tales, I say it is the first \"great\" one because it is a full-length film and has excellent production values. In fact, in many ways it's a wonderful film because it has such strange and over-the-top scenery representing the German Expressionist movement--with very surreal scenery and fantastic geometric designs. You just have to see it to believe it--it's that weird and original, plus it really adds to the dream-like quality of the film. Also, it rises to the level of greatness due to the fact that the film is not just a horror film but goes much deeper. I have always felt that great sci-fi or horror always has this greater depth and is usually a metaphor for modern life.The story is about the evil Dr. Caligari who is a traveling showman who uses his \"somnambulist\" (i.e., guy in a permanent sleepwalking state) to do his evil bidding. The account is given by a man who is trying to warn everyone about the doctor's evil plans. But, what more plot there is I will leave up to you so as not to spoil it.The only negative about the film at all is that it is a bit plodding here and there and the emotion is a little over-the-top even for the silent era. But, you also must understand that when the movie was being made in 1919-1920, this film STILL represented an improvement over the standard drama of the day and over-acting was more tolerable then than it is now.", "I've always been a fan of Edward Scissorhands, but after watching this film, I realized where Tim Burton may have gotten the idea for his film. One of the great displays of German Expressionism, I especially felt the score (though added years later) was quite moody, bringing out all of the emotions one should experience in a film like this. The sets were so unusual, so strange, that the film felt more like a stage production coming to life on the screen. A milestone in film, and one which should be continued to examined even after all of these years.", "`The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' may not be the kind of film that would shock today's audience, but its fascinating and horrific use of surrealistic atmosphere clearly had an influence on modern filmmakers such as David Cronenberg and David Lynch. While the story is not as involving as other German masterworks of the era, such as \"Metropolis,\" it can be appreciated for its unique vision.The thing that really strikes me about this film is the way the set design reflects the unstable mind of the narrator. The exterior scenes often include painted backgrounds featuring houses with sloped roofs and jutting edges, along with mountains that seem to twist and curl upwards into the sky. Although these backgrounds are not three-dimensionally realistic, they convincingly depict the gothic, surrealistic atmosphere with imagination and verve. The interior scenes have a claustrophobic feeling that generates from the walls, which are often at odd angles and slanting inward as they rise. Much of the design appears to be influenced by cubism; even the sinister Dr. Caligari looks square-shaped. The lighting also reflects the chilling mood, with shadows haunting the nooks and crannies in the background.The characters in the film sometimes seem equally freakish. All the actors wear makeup that make them appear as pale as a ghost, and the men are decked out in dark suits and capes. Ominous figures approach the camera directly in two haunting sequences early on: in the opening scene, when we see Jane walking towards us in a ghost-like white gown, and in the initial carnival scene, when Ceasre steps out of his box. In the end, we learn that it is really Francis who was insane the whole time; thus, the sets during the story, which is told by Francis himself, reflect his disoriented mind. Not surprisingly, the bookend scenes where he tries to tell his tale to an old man in a garden are the only ones to involve natural surroundings, such as trees and grass.For a one-hour horror film, \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" requires a lot of concentration on the viewer's part, especially since the story sometimes seems fragmented. Nonetheless, it will no doubt prove fascinating for years to come.", "Because this somewhat weird, German-Expressionist film (with its original colour tinting) is now 94 years old, I really did try to be lenient and cut it some slack with my overall rating of it.But, with that said, I'm sorry to have to tell you ('cause I'm not going to lie), the best that I could ever possibly give as a score for this silent-era freak-show would only be a measly 3 stars, and that's all. Regardless of its old age, it just doesn't deserve more than that.For one thing, at 75 minutes, this picture was about 20 minutes too long. And, when it came to its rather bizarre and deliberately distorted set designs, I found them, before long, to be quite boring, and literally under-whelming.You can be sure, had this fantasy film been made in the USA (circa. 1920), I highly doubt that all the snobs-of-early-cinema would still be falling all over themselves with absolute, undying praise for it, right to this very day.From my point of view, this vintage film's story was so simple that it came across as being downright simple-minded in nature. And, as far as the Dr. Caligari character goes, he was far from being convincingly sinister and treacherous. On the contrary, this dumpy, old fart struck me as being nothing but a stupid, senile, windbag who couldn't even scare a child.", "I saw this film on the same day that I saw Trainspotting, and those two films made me realise what cinema can really do. This is a film that tells it EXACTLY as the film makers see it. The warped visuals say more about its subjects than words ever could. The travelling fair is as twisted and ugly as all travelling fairs seem to be, and the expressionist sets and lighting sum up perfectly the sense of urban alienation in a very unnerving way. It's story is simple enough to be accessible, but don't expect a straightforward film - just let it speak to you."], "tt0010356": ["I'm inserting reviews for items I've seen that lack one...

Watch out for the high priest's toothless facial expressions.", "Die Pest in Florenz (aka The Plague in Florence) (1919) is an early adaptation of Edgar Alan Poe's Masque of the Red Death made all the more intriguing by a script from Fritz Lang that foreshadows many of his later, more famous motifs. Telling the tale of a rich temptress who enters Florence and immediately starts corrupting its piety and peasants, she casts her bewitching spell of lust and revelry on the leaders of the city, not to mention the local hermit monk. After the church leaves town the place literally goes to hell (where Lang gets his first crack at a dragon), ultimately becoming the target of a vengeful black death to settle the score for the papists back in the Vatican.More D.W.Griffith that Robert Wiene, it's clear that director Otto Rippert (of Homunculus fame) is no Lang but there are some elements that keep one entertained. Visually, there is some shot 'matting' that is quite well developed and adds interest but, for me, the most fun was had seeing all the elemental story prototypes that Lang would develop more fully in his own Niebelungen films or Metropolis, particularly the lone woman coming in and destroying the well-ordered society by driving the men nuts. The Murnau restoration is first rate and, while it might not be everybody's cup of mead, I thoroughly enjoyed the modernist score by Uwe Dierksen.", "One of the usual ways Weimar cinema is written about is as a product of a country devastated by war, inflation and, ultimately, Nazis, but there are surely worthy research topics for the effects of the 1918 Influenza pandemic on the film industry. Not only Germany, either--there seems a surprising dearth of film scholarship (and, perhaps, historical writing in general, but I know less about that) in regards to that misnomer \"Spanish flu.\" Most film books I've read on the time period don't even mention it (recently double checking the indexes of some of my library, I found nothing), and those that do tend only to mention theatre closings. Historian Richard Koszarski, for one, corrects in an article for \"Film History\" his own error of omission in his addition on the era to the otherwise thorough \"History of the American Cinema\" series. A thread has emerged on the subject at Nitrateville, a website of message boards devoted to silent and classic cinema. Anyways, I bring this up because \"The Plague in Florence,\" while about a past epidemic, was made during a time of another plague, and, of course, in 2020, I'm reviewing it as still another pandemic rages. I doubt this is a coincidence.A striking conflation in the film, I suspect, is found in the dead. In recently learning more about the Influenza pandemic, it seems unusual in how it largely killed young, otherwise healthy people and also for how symptoms reportedly would strike them suddenly. Just about the only contemporary film I've seen on the subject, a public-information picture, \"Dr. Wise on Influenza\" (1919), indeed, depicts a young man abruptly collapsing in public from the flu. \"The Plague in Florence\" nominally concerns the Black Death, the plague. The bodies in the streets and even the vision of rivers of bodies here may be attributed to this historic bacterial disease. The most commonly attributed symptom of plague, however, are the buboes (hence, \"bubonic\" plague), the inflamed lymph nodes scarring bodies. That isn't seen here; characters are simply infected and collapse. They tend to be young and otherwise healthy, too. We don't see the so-called Council of Elders succumb in such a way.Also interesting is how the plague infects the political dynamics in the picture. In the film, there's a, let's say, war between the lovers of orgies and repressive fanatics, some of the latter of who are quite rapacious themselves. The free-love republicans come to power, but then the Pestilence comes to upend this political, religious and sexual situation. Sounds of its time in the tumultuous Weimar Republic for a costume drama, or Kost\u00fcmfilme, as the revisionist German film history books in my collection dismiss it. Such past historical interpretations seem as though they'll be challenged, though, if they haven't yet been, especially in light of the current pandemic. Silent-film enthusiast Fritzi Kramer, of the Movies Silently website, has already written a good review of \"The Plague in Florence.\" For the U.S., Koszarski and others have mentioned how cinema closures likely aided Adolph Zukor's plans to vertically integrate Paramount--leading to the system that would dominate Hollywood for decades. (Likewise, today, we've at least seen a hastening of the upsurge of streaming and the market share of China's theatrical market.)As historically interesting as all of this is--following a thread through three pandemics--until I'm able to see a nice print and restoration of a 1919 silent film by way of Blu-ray on a large TV screen in my own home, none of this is to say that \"The Plague in Florence\" isn't a flawed and, even for its day, dated picture. The reason it's available at all, in a collection of his silent works from Kino, is that Fritz Lang, early in his career, is credited as scenarist. Directing was Otto Rippert, otherwise seemingly only known for another rather obscure, but conceptually-intriguing silent film, \"Homunculus,\" a Frankenstein-esque serial from 1916. Part of the problem is that Lang's scenario is meandering. The Black Death doesn't arrive until an hour and 20 minutes in, and, then, more than a loose resemblance to Edgar Allen Poe's \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" it largely serves as obscene evangelizing; or, as a couple title card puts it, \"The stones begin to speak. And nature revolts against the lovemaking that is abhorrent to nature.\" The scenario also seems to shift the protagonist between three characters in a lackluster love triangle, one an unfortunate siren trope of a woman who's blamed for the lust of the men who chase after her, one a dandy dressed in the usual flamboyant fashion one imagines of a Florentine man of the Medieval and Renaissance times and the other a grave monk prostrating himself beside a crucifixion idol before constructing his own cross.The so-called orgies, too, that the monk at first laments, are hardly more than kissing-and-hugging parties of lounging about to music. Had Germany not imported the Babylon sequences from D.W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916) by then or what? I wasn't expecting \"Caligula\" (1979), but even by 1910s standards, these supposed orgies are tame. This is some of the worst timing I've seen of party planning, too: in one scene, the woman is saved from being almost raped and so decides it's a good time for a festival and, later, as soon as the plague enters, they decide to throw a masquerade ball! Rather undermines the city's closed-wall quarantine, one would think.It doesn't help, either, that the acting is dated in the stilted fashion before the likes of, say, Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford or, across the Atlantic, Asta Nielsen and Pola Negri offered more naturalistic or, at least, cinematically, as opposed to theatrically, intended performances. There are a lot of broad gestures--raising of arms and whatnot--in this one. To be fair, such acting does correspond to an often distant camera, and, in that respect, there is some admittedly fine work done in deep stagings, including interiors divided into up to three planes to accentuate the extreme depth of field and crowded long views of enormous sets. Yet, these tableau stagings seem dated by 1919, when classical continuity cinema had already emerged, including in Germany as Ernst Lubitsch's \"Madame DuBarry\" (1919) will attest. Overall, the crosscutting and scene dissection--particularly for interiors--is relatively scant here. Maurice Tourneur was already editing conversations into over-the-shoulder shot/reverse shots in \"Victory\" (1919); meanwhile, the camera sits in the same place here for entire or almost entire scenes and returns to the same seat for scenes in the same locations, such as that pathetic fight scene where one guy appears to faint from flexing his own muscles as the other guy merely holds his shoulders and arms.Nevertheless, and even though the moralizing of the picture is self-defeating, the notion itself of lovers battling the Church is amusing. The vision scene of the \"place of lost souls,\" including that river of corpses, a dragon and other weird stuff, is a highlight, and it reminds me of a Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s f\u00e9erie, where a fairy godmother type--replaced here, then, by the monk--would often guide the hero with such fantastic spectacle of stage and trick effects. Earlier, there's a torture scene. Ultimately, it's the plague that interests most here, though, especially in 1919 amid another pandemic... especially now in 2020.", "'Seven chapters from the Italian Renaissance as told by Fritz Lang' an opening title card tells us, thus getting one chapter up on the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt's book, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy from 1860. In the film, the youth of Florence are chafing under the yoke of Church and State power since they just want to have fun. Along comes the seductive courtesan Julia, who halts the Corpus Christi procession and whose entertainments are soon giving the young people what they've been looking for. Church and State strike back, as does the hermit Medardus, whom Julia converts to her ways. The plague begins making the rounds and Medardus, seeing the error of his ways, brings the Black Death into the city, ending his life, Julia's life, and the film. Lang's philosophy in constructing the plot seems to have been, 'If in doubt, keep it in,' so there's a bit of everything in the plot: Susannah and the elders, Masque of the Red Death, etc., and the film might have been more effective had Lang not ranged quite so widely afield. The sets and settings are especially well done and the photography very good. The acting may seem quite mannered to us, but Cesare and the Cardinal have formidable faces and Medardus, the tortured hermit, is sympathetic."], "tt0010793": [], "tt0010821": ["Half a century before Amicus popularised the horror anthology here in Britain, and a good quarter of a century before the Ealing classic DEAD OF NIGHT, Austrian-born director Richard Oswald made UNCANNY TALES. It's a five-story anthology from Germany in which screen stars Conrad Veidt, Reinhold Schunzel and Anita Berber play Death, the Devil and a ghostly prostitute respectively. They emerge from old paintings in an antiques store overnight, kicking out the owner before reading five very different stories in which the stars also take the lead roles. In the first, Veidt begins an affair with an abused wife only to have her mysteriously vanish on him; the twist ending is a great one and later repeated in the British film SO LONG AT THE FAIR. In the second, Schunzel and Veidt play rival suitors. Schunzel loses a bet and bumps off Veidt, only to be haunted by the ghost of his creeping hand. I was reminded of the Christopher Lee segment in DR TERROR'S HOUSE OF HORRORS here; the effects are far more primitive but the chilling effect the same. The third story is an effective reworking of Poe's THE BLACK CAT with all the right ingredients, while the fourth tells of the 'Suicide Club' and a fatal card game, with Veidt made up as Roderick Usher. There's another decent twist at the climax. The final story is a slight comedic effort in which a haunting is deliberately staged. It's a strong film, very atmospheric and with a good pace to sustain every story, episodic though they are.", "An aspect of this film that amused me was that four out of the five stories involve romantic triangles of one sort or another. A man picks up a woman who cries on his shoulder, and pretty soon he's kissing her in her bedroom, though he is pushed out because she has a headache (oops, the plague). Two men decide that the girl who has left them at a club to dance with somebody else must belong to one of them, so they throw dice for her; she is surprised to find one of them lying on her couch when she comes home and not pleased that he's a corpse; when she meets the other a few years later, they seem ready to take up where they left off. A drunkard takes a stranger home to his wife and within 30 seconds the stranger is kissing the wife (Conrad Veidt gets to do all the kissing in this movie). A wise French marquis encourages his wife to snuggle up to an amorous stranger, then shows her that he himself is a much better snuggle. All this (plus another story) in a version that only lasted about 95 minutes.Because the segments are so short, each seduction takes at most a few minutes. There is no time for anyone to be sentimental or even fall in love--it's lust at first sight in every case. True, usually someone in the story dies before fornication or adultery can be committed. But there is something about the galloping pace that brings the horror--the deaths, the hauntings--right up against the sexy parts in a balder way that is usual in the early horror movies I've seen.The film is fun because each actor gets to play a wide range of characters. Reinhold Schunzel particularly gets to play a crazy sadistic brute, a sly drunken brute, a jealous but gentlemanly brute, a masterful cop, and a charming but cowardly 18th-century marquis. Anita Berber has a scene in which she (or a double? there was more costume around her head than around her legs) performs a fairly lengthy piece of modern dance--this character is a proto-flapper, but she also does quiet little 19th-c American wife and \"the Strumpet\" with great energy and sweetness. Veidt--well, as I said, he is the guys who get to the kissing as fast as possible in 4 of the stories, and a sadistic monster in the fifth. Who could ask for more?", "2003 review:Richard Oswald directs a fascinating selection of tales co-starring a youthful Conrad Veidt, Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel and Anita Berber.SLIGHT SPOILERSAs others have said this film has a rather casual feel to it, accentuated by the opening shots of the three actors, gathered for the camera, almost as though taking bows before the film proper. A framing sequence has the three emerge from old paintings in an antiquarian bookshop,and read the stories which the film illustrates Through most of these, Veidt and Schunzel play rivals over Berber, and the stories include Poe's \"The Black Cat\" and an excellent run through of Stevenson's \"Suicide Club\" Played for the most part in real time the latter builds a real sense of unease as the clock inexorable approaches midnight. However the best story is \"Die Hand\" in which Sch\u00fcnzel murders Berber's husband, Veidt, in order to have her to himself and is then haunted by the latter during a s\u00e9ance.Playing somewhat like an Amicus compendium 50 years before the event, Weird Tales may be a modest affair, but it's fast moving, atmospherically shot and occasionally stylish. The version I saw was a beautiful 2002 restoration with an evocative score and German title cards (not a problem except in the last and weakest story where the titles are in verse)Whilst it's not a great film it's fast moving and enjoyable and stands up well 84 years later.2014 update:But it's in its central trio of performers that the film holds it's real interest \u2013 each illustrating a different aspect of how art and culture in Germany would evolve in the turbulent years to come.Most familiar is Conrad Veidt - the versatile and expressive star of German and international cinema. Here, as always, he is fascinating in what seems like a warm up for his great roles in the 20's.He became a favourite German actor, starring in dozens of films across Europe and in America. An avowed anti-Nazi, yet one who believed in the essential goodness of people, he relocated to England in 1932 but continued appearing in German productions until a notorious incident in 1934. He had just completed the remake of \"William Tell and was due to return to England for \"Jew Suess\" a tale of a Jewish 18th Century financier who tries to ease his people's oppression through his influence at court.Knowing of this, Goebels had Veidt placed under house arrest and he was forced to write a \"sick note\" to the UK producer, Michael Balcon. However Balcon was suspicious and being diplomatically connected, threatened to create an international incident of this unless an approved doctor was allowed to examine Veidt.Of course Veidt was perfectly well and the Nazis were forced to release him. Veidt was subsequently vilified in the German press and from then on only worked in England, France and America and 71years after his death is remembered with particular affection by his British fans.The rather obscure Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel also excels, a protean figure here, and similar in life \u2013 alternating between acting and directing throughout his career. His directorial style was influenced by his two mentors (Richard Oswald and Ernst Lubitsch,) and several of his films (Viktor und Viktoria (1933) and Amphityron (1935)) show an unmistakable light and risqu\u00e9 touch.Despite his Jewish background, Schunzel's success as a director was such that he was awarded the dubious distinction of Honorary Aryan and permitted to continue in Germany. But he grew frustrated by the increasing interference on his projects and left for America in 1937.He directed a few films at MGM (none with particular success) but his career stalled with the failure of \" Ice Follies of 1939\", a disaster of such proportion that star Joan Crawford was labelled \"box-office poison\".After that he returned to acting - notably as the sly Nazi doctor who suggests slowly poisoning Ingrid Bergman in Hitchcock's \"Notorious\". He continued in smaller parts through the early 50's before attempting to revive his directorial career in Germany.But he discovered that his association with Nazi era cinema had indelibly stained him. He was fired from his comeback film \"Die Dubarry\" (1951), had difficulty finding further work and died penniless in 1954.Then there's Anita Berber \u2013 resembling a 19th century version of Nina Hagan. Berber is the femme fatale at the centre of each story and in the prologue she satirises the dewy eyed heroine most leading actresses played in those days.She's an enthusiastic and energetic presence throughout the film and a good match for her co-stars.In one sequence we catch a glimpse of her dancing on stage - and it was in this guise that 19 year old Berber came to director Oswald's attention.Berber had undoubted star quality and was busy in the following years - even appearing opposite Veidt and Schunzel again.But Berber's acting was eclipsed by her real life notoriety - as artist, writer and avante-garde dancer whose performances (often nude and overtly sexual) shocked the more conservative factions. In addition her open bisexually and prolific drug taking marked her as one of the most controversial figures in 20's Berlin and she can be seen as a vampire type figure in a famous Otto Dix portrait of 1926.Berber would have perished under the Nazis - Hitler apparently described her as the \"Devil's spawn\". But her decadent lifestyle ensured she didn't live that long, contracting TB whilst on tour and dying at just 30 in November 1928.So watch and enjoy this little compendium, marvel at the stranger than fiction lives of those starring in this, and wonder at the dull as dirt people we think of as \"stars\" today.", "Any devotee of vintage horror films will want to see Conrad Veidt in an anthology of fantastic tales, but will be disappointed if he expects another \"Waxworks\" or \"Destiny.\" This looks as if it had been tossed together rather casually, as an actors' lark, and the actors, especially Veidt, mug exuberantly. The five tales, sketchily told, are \"The Black Cat,\" \"The Suicide Club,\" stories of hauntings real and fake, and the old anecdote about the man whose wife disappears from an inn where everyone swears she was never there. These are read by three figures who have stepped out of paintings in an antiquarian bookshop and driven off the (exceedingly odd) owner. The three appear in all the stories, usually with the two men as rivals for the woman. The tone of the framing story and one of the tales from the books is comic, and that of the others deliberately exaggerated. The prevailing weirdness tends to neutralize the scary moments, and so does the Wagnerian music with which the version distributed by LS Video has been unwisely scored. This version doesn't look bad compared to some old films on video (one can clearly make out the actors' faces), but the condition of the print makes it impossible to tell how the film looked originally. It's no classic, but an entertaining view of a young Veidt running the gamut of extreme emoting.", "Unheimliche Geschichten is an anthology of five short \"Uncanny Stories\" read by Death, the Devil and the Harlot who step out of three life sized paintings in an old bookstore after closing. Though really none of these tales are very frightening, Conrad Veidt's menacing looks and dramatic performances in each, undoubtedly helped him secure the role of Caesar in The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari (1920). Oswald's use of the anthology format may also be the earliest in the history of the horror genre of cinema.", "The original negative of Eerie Tales is lost; what remains is a partial restoration.The film, an anthology, begins with a prelude in an antiquarian bookshop. After the shopkeeper turns out the lights at night, the characters in three portraits -- the Devil, a prostitute, and Death -- come alive and read scary stories, each tale depicted featuring the same actors (Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel, Anita Berber and Conrad Veidt) who play the living paintings.In the first story, the Apparition, a man falls for a woman who is being stalked by her abusive ex-husband. When the woman disappears, the man discovers that the woman died of the plague. Or at least I think that is what happened. I have to admit that I was little confused, the lack of adequate title cards for the dialogue making this one difficult to follow.Next up is The Hand. Two men play a game of dice to decide which of them will romance the beauty that they both have the hots for. The loser of the game promptly strangles the winner, but is haunted by the dead man's ghost. A mediocre tale of the macabre, although the ghostly footprints and the spectral hand effects were fun.Director Richard Oswald tackles Edgar Allen Poe's The Black Cat next. I am sure you know the story to this one, suffice to say that this version holds few surprises but is still reasonably entertaining.The penultimate story is Robert Louis Stevenson's The Suicide Club, in which a man is inducted into a club where the members gamble with their lives. This one is a lot of fun, as the man draws the unlucky Ace of Spades from a deck of cards and is given only a few minutes left to live. Both The Black Cat and The Suicide Club would be revisited by Oswald for his superior 1932 talkie Tales of the Uncanny.Lastly, we have The Spectre, a rather weak tale to finish with. A married woman is romanced by a baron, her jealous husband pulling some spooky pranks to frighten the bounder.Having read their stories, the three characters from the portraits resume their places within their frames.4.5/10, rounded up to 5 for all of the heavy black eye make-up.", "One of the finest and most underrated film's from the Weimar Era, \"Eerie Tales\" (Unheimliche Geschichten) is a watchable and entertaining mix of horror, suspense and fantasy. When portraits in a bookstore come to life and enact stories from classic literature then one knows one is in for quite a unique treat. With its modernist touch despite the standard theatrical acting of the time, the creepy atmosphere that pervades throughout the film, the striking black and white and its unsettling plots the movie foreshadowed the fabled Expressionist genre that was shortly to come. I watched this primarily to view Anita Berber and it was interesting to see Weimar Germany's most notorious femme fatale in action. Though no conventional beauty she had a charm with a tough knowing look that reveals the complicated personality she was known for. Although long and seeming to go on forever the film moves at a consistently steady pace despite its age. A distinct artifact from a fascinating time this is one relic from history that's memorable and worth the watch.", "\"Unheimliche Geschichten\" (and I could list a dozen alternate titles here, in English and German) is a German black-and-white silent film that run slightly over 2 hours in the original, but slightly under 100 minutes in the DVD version. Actually, this is not really a movie, but rather a collection of 5 short stories told to each other by creepy horror creatures. Anita Berber, Conrad Veidt and Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel play all the major characters in here and, in my opinion, the only one who makes it somewhat worth watching is Veidt. He was still pretty young here just like the other two, so this was a bit of a film by the new generation of actors. But this Richard Oswald movie was never a rewarding watch. It was not emotional, not engaging, not dramatically relevant and certainly not scary. There are many better German silent horrors from around that time. I do not recommend watching this one. Thumbs down, it dragged on several occasions. And the intertitles as poems were simply bad. They should have been normal text and a lot more frequent.", "\"Richard Oswald's \"Eerie Tales\" debuted with a length of 2318 metres, July 16, 1920, after a premiere on November 6, 1919.

In \"The Hand,\" based on the Robert Liebmann tale, two men - Veidt and Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel, who plays the devil - engage in a duel that continues past one man's death. \"The Black Cat\" is the Poe story, with Schunzel murdering his wife (Berber) and walling her up. In the film's take on Robert Lewis Stevenson's \"The Suicide Club\" is about a detective who tracks down a secret society just as they pick him as their next victim.

The Dark Mirror may indeed have been ahead of audience tastes; it cost $135,992 to produce, and grossed $192,222. The nearest precedent was Ince's The Family Skeleton, but that film had opened in a seemingly light-hearted fashion, only gradually revealing the abyss of alcoholism into which the protagonist would be drawn. By contrast, The Dark Mirror began in medias res, compelling the viewer to immediately begin to sort out the strange events that unfold.Dorothy Dalton stars in a dual role, but only gradually is this apparent. The Dark Mirror opens on the \"Street of Strange Faces\" with a femme fatale Apache, Norah Omore. She has attracted the love of an honest Spaniard, Mario (Pedro de Cordoba), who wants to marry her, despite knowing her affiliation with gang leader Red Carnehan (Walter Neeland). They barely escape the police, and this turns out to have been the nightmare of Priscilla Maine, whose family regards her as odd for preferring to spend time in her studio. Priscilla asks her friend, Dr. Philip Fosdick (Huntley Gordon), a \"psycho-analyst,\" to help explain her strange dreams. Like her father, Priscilla is a painter, but she knows nothing of her mother. As Fosdick leaves, a newspaper boy sells him an \"extra\" with the precise gangland incident Priscilla dreamt the night before.Priscilla awakens in this world, as events follow one another in the patchwork manner typical of dreams. One of her confederates takes her to Red, but it turns out to be Mario, although a few minutes later, she turns around to find Red menacing her, only to be saved by the returning Mario. Getting into a cab with Mario, Norah is spotted by Fosdick, completing a deeply surreal sequence.Increasingly aware of the \"lowlife\" character she plays in her dreams, Priscilla is learning to impersonate \"Norah,\" and these episodes may become exciting wish-fulfillment. Their names reflect this ambivalence, Omore, approximating the word for love in Mediterranean countries, contrasting with the \"Maine\"-stream surname.At a showing of Priscilla's self-portrait, one of the gangsters mistakes her for Norah. Then, as she sleeps, Priscilla's ghost-like spirit transfers into the body of Norah, now in the Jersey countryside with Mario. Red drowns her in the nearby lake.Fosdick has learned that Mario and Norah were married a week earlier, but she is abducted by the gang. Red is dismayed when he suddenly sees the woman he has just killed. Priscilla wakes up beside Fosdick; they have driven out to Mario's residence. They look for Norah's body, while Red is guiltily doing the same, returning to the scene of his crime, mystified that she is apparently still alive. Seeing Priscilla, he drowns himself.The Dark Mirror, having mixed dream and rational states throughout, leaves open possibilities until the final shot. Fosdick explains to Priscilla that her father married one of his models, a gypsy, and they had twin daughters. When separated, his wife took Norah, and \"The strong psychic affinity that exists between twins explains all the mystery of your dreams.\" Mario, although realizing his wife has died, and planning to return to Spain, asks to see Priscilla. Fosdick is clearly nervous. However, he need not be, for she now realizes that she has always loved him.While achieving closure, by this point, the dream imagery has overlapped with what must have been experienced \"out of body\" in almost a supernatural way. The alternating dream and reality are not susceptible of rational or Freudian explanation. (According to an article in the April 1919 issue of Photo-Play Journal, star Dalton was a believer in the prescience of dreams and collected information on psychic phenomenon). As Priscilla notes after Fosdick's explanation, \"From the dreams something seems to be calling me\u2014always calling.\"Released in May 1920, The Dark Mirror (based on a novel by Louis Joseph Vance) is a startling document, revealing homegrown tendencies in the Hollywood cinema toward surrealism and a fractured narrative customarily attributed to later foreign influences. It was simply one of the star vehicles Thomas Ince had contracted with Paramount for in 1917, and Dalton had been one of the stars, but this series allowed Ince to create some extraordinary and unusual productions."], "tt0011108": [], "tt0011130": ["This silent-era classic stars the one and only John Barrymore in the lead role. Barrymore's performance is clearly the one since most imitated by others. It is likely his performance as Hyde here that influenced later cartoon versions and what have you. The menacing stare, those creepy large hands held high ready to strike, the crouched over position, the evil intent in the eyes and the brow. Barrymore is simply fantastic and he pulls this off with much less make-up than many others. It's amazing how he can also pull off playing the tormented Dr. Jekyll-the complete opposite of Hyde perfectly and shows his tremendous range as an actor.", "As a medical doctor, Henry Jekyll (John Barrymore) maintains a human \"repair shop\" for the poor and destitute at his own expense. Generally acknowledged as too good to be true, Jekyll is challenged by socialite Sir George Carew to experience more of life for himself, before he marries Carew's daughter Millicent (Martha Mansfield). \"Think what it would mean! To yield to every evil impulse - yet leave the soul untouched!\"After meeting night club dancer Gina (Nita Naldi), Jekyll becomes consumed by obsession, spending day and night in his lab developing a drug that will give him the freedom to explore his baser nature. Jekyll's early transformations are almost comic in their execution, he flails his body wildly and even falls down completely as his body transforms into the hideously deformed creature Mr. Hyde. As Hyde plunges deeper into vice, his evil nature threatens to overcome Jekyll's entire life. Jekyll even creates a will leaving his effects to the sinister alter ego in case he's unable to come out of one of his mutations.A particularly well done scene explores Jekyll's psyche as he lies in bed contemplating his fate; he imagines a huge hairy spider crawling up on his bed and bonding with his own body. Symbolically it cements the viewers understanding of Jekyll's transformation into a creature of evil and monstrous intent.As Sir George confronts Jekyll, he changes into the most gruesome countenance of Hyde yet, and beats Sir George to death. Without the drug that will keep him normal, he's no longer able to control his transformations. Despondent, he takes his own life, or should I say, Mr. Hyde kills Dr. Jekyll to put an end to the reign of terror in his Soho neighborhood.At times over the top, John Barrymore's performance is well presented, his portrayal leaves one with an appreciation for his art and his interpretation of the John Louis Stevenson character. Martha Mansfield is demurely pretty as the pining lover who patiently keeps her love for Dr. Jekyll alive, even though she has no idea what a monster he has become. Though a silent film with occasional word screens, one has no trouble in following the details of the story to it's dramatic conclusion. The only mitigating factor for the print I viewed was the musical score that at times did not match the on screen drama, seeming instead to be more upbeat than it's subject matter.", "Through countless adaptations, including movies, the gist of Robert Lewis Stevenson's \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" is familiar to those who have never even touched the novella. The doppelg\u00e4nger, or doubles, theme of its battle between the good and evil within oneself are shared heritage, even though the Victorian age it was set in, the suspicions of invention and science and some of the psychological notions have since passed. This 1920 filmed version, the first highly regarded one, presents the story as it has been most commonly handed down: the narrative is simplified, removing the original mystery, and it takes the perspective of Dr. Jekyll, reducing the role of Mr. Utterson.There are some interesting parts to this adaptation, especially when comparing it to the later 1931 and 1941 versions. The competing beliefs between Jekyll and Dr. Lanyon are well rendered, as are those between Jekyll and Sir George, who is, apparently, based in Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". Additionally, the rationale behind Jekyll's experiment is altered more illogical by concerning it with one's soul, instead of the hypocrisy of the two-faced upper classmen who present themselves respectably for the public but also want to visit the prostitutes at night.Anyhow, for better or worse, John Barrymore is restrained (considering the role and the film era). There's an odd giant spider nightmare in this one, too. The best aspect of this version, I think, is its horror atmosphere, with the studio sets of the fogy, lamp-lit London slums and even the detailed interior designs add something--production values that make this early entry stand out. Barrymore contributes to this, especially with the makeup to create his deformed Hyde that could rival Lon Chaney's creations.To see a major point of difference between the three major Hollywood adaptations, as well as an indication of Hollywood's evolution and how this 1920 version stands out, compare Barrymore's horrific and grotesque Hyde with that of Fredric March and Spencer Tracy: notice how Hyde becomes easier on the eyes with each subsequent decade.", "I have not seen this film for quite some time though I can always conjure up the face of John Barrymore as Mr.Hyde. Bent double with hideous pointed features and spider-like hands he is still truly frightening after all these years. When will producers understand that effects are no match for a talented actor with only himself the clothes on his back and make-up. Barrymore distorts himself is the same manner as Lon Chaney performed and conjures up the dark side of Jekyll's personality. A chilling film that seeps into the mind and is still the benchmark film version for Stevenson's classic tale.", "DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (Paramount, 1920), directed by John S. Robertson, ranks the best known silent screen adaptations from the famous 1886 story by Robert Louis Stevenson and the 1897 stage play starring Richard Mansfield. Featuring the then unlikely John Barrymore, a matin\u00e9e idol better known as \"The Great Profile,\" this early horror film features the young actor to good advantage in portraying two entirely different characters in one motion picture. Those familiar with the Stevenson story, especially with its latter remakes during the sound era, whether starring Fredric March in 1931 (for which he won an Academy Award as best actor) or Spencer Tracy in 1941 (a very good film but often dismissed due to its miscasting) the story itself has its alterations.Set in 19th century England, Henry Jekyll (John Barrymore), \"an idealist and philanthropist, by profession a doctor of medicine,\" spending his time not only conducting experiments in his laboratory attached to his home, but treatinghis patients at a free clinic for the poor at his own expense. He's engaged to Millicent Carewe (Martha Mansfield), but their relationship appears to be mainly platonic. Arriving late at a dinner gathering at the Carewe home, Sir George Carewe, (Brandon Hurst), Millicent's father and Jekyll's mentor, soon becomes Jekyll's evil influence when he suggests the possibilities of man living by his instincts, yet having another side to his nature. Carewe later accompanies Jekyll to a London music hall where they are not only surrounded by a class of patrons beneath their status, but watch a flirtatious young dancer named Gina (Nita Naldi) perform. \"For the first time in his life, Jekyll had awakened to the sense of his baser nature.\" Spending days and nights in his lab with his experiments, Jekyll, after drinking down his invented formula, soon transforms into his evil self. Becoming the uncontrollable person he names Edward Hyde, Jekyll's evil self begins a relationship with the sultry Gina, eventually making her life miserable. Hyde goes on a murderous rampage, taking control over Jekyll's immortal soul. Jekyll's experiment gets the better of him when he keeps changing into the evil Hyde against his will, returning to his gentler self through an antidote, becoming a recluse and spending more time away from Millicent. When Jekyll's antidote supply runs dry, he tries to fight the urge of evil. After murdering a child of the streets in the poor district of town, and later Sir George who witnessed the evil change in his future son-in-law, Jekyll realizes that he's unable to undo his evil deeds, and suffers more as he tries to prevent himself from making Millicent his next victim.Supporting Barrymore in the cast are Charles Lane as Doctor Richard Lanyon; Cecil Clovelly as Edward Enfield; Louis Wolheim as the music hall proprietor; and George Stevens as Poole, Jekyll's butler.Produced shortly before what future star Lon Chaney would have achieved in a role such as this, Barrymore's performs his most memorable moments during his transformation scenes. Every transformation captured on film shows the viewer a more hideous manifestation of Jekyll's other self. Quite theatrical to say the least, but what's amazing is Barrymore's constant jerking of his body with his hair flopping about before the closeup of that hideous facial expression, which must have been quite intense for 1920 audiences. It's been reported that Barrymore changed into the evil Mr. Hyde without the use of makeup, unlike Chaney, who would have done his transformation similar to Fredric March's 1931 sound version, looking more like a hideous animal than a grotesque human creature. For Spencer Tracy's 1941 performance, like Barrymore, he's still in human form but his facial gestures appear inhuman. More added touches of evil include Jekyll's somewhat pointed head as well as close up of Jekyll's hand becoming a withered claw. Something worth noting is one where Jekyll sleeps in his bed and imagines a ghostly giant spider crawling upon him. Because of Barrymore's \"great profile\" image and matin\u00e9e idol reputation, the camera takes full advantage in his numerous profiled closeups, yet this was the film that firmly establish Barrymore's movie career.DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE became one of the final thirteen movies aired on public television's THE SILENT YEARS (1971) as hosted by Orson Welles. Accompanied by an organ score by Gaylord Carter, the film runs at length to about 62 minutes. In later years, the silent version to DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE was distributed on video cassette, with the print shown on THE SILENT YEARS released through Blackhawk Video in the 1980s. At present, the length of the movie varies. It could be as long as 75 minutes or more, depending on the projection speed. Shorter prints could be the possibility of a deleted sequence or two taken from reissue copies. For the Blackhawk edition, a sudden cut is noticeable as Millicent (Martha Mansfield) is seen sitting sadly alone, longing for her fianc\u00e9, followed by an immediate cut showing Millicent, surrounded by some people, running happily up the stairs with a letter clasped in her hand. Besides JEKYLL AND HYDE's availability on video, it's also been recently distributed on DVD.DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE consisted of several earlier American-made versions (1912, 1913, and another in 1920 to compete with the Barrymore film), but for whatever copy is available for viewing, this 1920 production featuring Barrymore is the only easy access for viewing. Out of circulation on the TV markets since the 1970s, it finally resurfaced on Turner Classic Movies October 24, 2004, as part of its annual Halloween fright feast. The print with the Gaylord Carter organ score has circulated on TCM until its March 6, 2011 presentation consisting a new orchestral score composed by Al Kryszak that's one I would not recommend after listening better scores in the past. (***)", "I'm afraid this is my favourite film version of the tale. I say afraid because I think all the versions following this were technically better, but I still come back to this one. It's faults are legion, mainly from the technological standpoint, and you can also sometimes shake your head at the acting talents displayed, but the atmosphere of the film as a Victorian melodrama is unbeatable. The age of the film itself actually helps in this case (in these digital times), with plenty of blurred smoky foggy images to contemplate. As in the case of Hitchcock's 39 Steps, I preferred the film to the book.Barrymore/Hyde's convulsions can be mirth inducing, but you can't argue with the fact that if you saw him in real life you'd cross the road to avoid him. Watch his expression after he kills Carew!This DVD version ran a sedate b&w 82 minutes - after a lifetime of watching a tinted 59 minuter it took some getting used to, and the music was totally unsympathetic to the action too. Therefore the next time I trot this out it really will be silent! But well worth watching seminal stuff especially if you're interested in seeing the best film (that survives anyhow) from 1920.", "This is one of the earliest (but not the earliest) movie version of the famous story of Jekyll & Hyde, based on the novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, the man who also wrote the novel Treasure Island, among other works. It's one of the best movie versions but at the same time also probably the least known. Movies from the '20's don't really reach a wide audience. People probably only know the '31 and '41 versions of this movie. A shame, since lots of '20's deserve some more recognition from a wider audience. They're artistic, style-full and overall also well written and impressive. The images themselves had to be speaking for itself and had to be impressive of course since the images basically were the only tool to tell the story and all its emotions with. \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" is one of those '20's movies that deserves more credit and fame than its currently getting.The movie is very well made and the story is extremely solid written and features some interesting elements. The way Dr. Jekyll is torn between his evil and good side is brought effectively to the screen. The movie is basically about the battle between good and evil, only this time set into the mind of one man. It is mainly due to the solid written story that this premise works out so well and effective.Of course also the acting helps a lot to tell the story with. Conform '20's style, every actor goes over-the-top in his performance, with exaggerated movements and facial expressions. Especially Cecil Clovelly goes way too over-the-top in his role. Also of course John Barrymore does this, especially when he is turned into Mr. Hyde. But nevertheless every actor feels well cast and plays his or her role with lots of profession. The still very young looking John Barrymore is good in his role as both Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward Hyde and he plays both roles convincing, despite going a bit too much over-the-top at moments.The movie only features a bit too many unnecessary characters that don't add enough, or anything at all to the story. On top of that there also are some needless sequences, which don't seem to serve a purpose. Such as the Italian historical sequences, told by Gina. Yes, it serves a purpose later for the story but it could had easily been done in a more simple and shorter way, to make the movie flow better.Perhaps the most surprising thing about this movie is its look. The sets look impressively detailed, although the entire movie is obviously filmed on a stage. Also the costumes and make-up are good, as are the impressive looking early special effects, which also adds to the horror of this movie.Yes, as an horror movie this movie also works well. It's atmosphere feels dark and the Mr. Hyde character makes sure that the movie always remains unpredictable as well as both tense and scary.The ending is very well written and also works very effective. It's well thought out and handled and provides the movie with an impressive and memorable ending, which might also come quite unexpected, since it's not an happy one.A must-see for the fans of the story and horror fans in general.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "Nearly everybody has seen the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in one of the more modern versions,  but nobody has ever portrayed it as successfully as John Barrymore did.  This movie, a silent classic, has amazing special effects for its day.  Specifically I refer to the metamorphosis of Dr. Jekyll.  You will literally not recognize or believe that the same actor playing Dr. Jekyll is also playing Mr. Hyde.  The make-up, the lighting, and Barrymore's excellent acting give you the feeling that this is truly a different, darker, more evil man.  Berrymore completes the transition from clean-cut Doctor to dementedly violent madman so naturally that you almost forget it's not real.  You have to see this!  It'll still scare you after all these years!", "Early silent version of the classic horror tale holds up incredibly well more than eight decades later. John Barrymore is the well-to-do doctor who concocts a serum that allows his dark side to find a home in his alter ego. But how long can this double identity survive before one of the personalities absorbs the other?DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE works as well as it does thanks in no small part to Barrymore, the early screen legend. His amazing performance transcends the lack of sound, scratchy picture and obvious limitations. He is the definitive Dr. Jekyll and a suitably creepy Mr. Hyde. Barrymore's co-stars more than hold their own, proving that acting is an inherited talent, not something that is necessarily developed through years of schooling. Brandon Hurst in particular stands out as the upperclassman Sir George Carew.The film also benefits from its strong script and dialog, though much of the credit there must go to Robert Louis Stevenson, who authored the book on which it is based. What could have easily been a mediocre man-turned-monster outing is instead smart, thought-provoking and imaginative. Director John S. Robertson is to be highly praised.I went into DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE prepared to cut it heaps of slack given its 1920 production date. But not once did I have to award it brownie points for trying. This is a screen gem from which the Hollywood of today could learn some valuable lessons.", "Dr. Jekyll has a grand idea... what if he could harness man's evil in two distinct forms? His colleague says no, that would cause man to be both god and devil. But Jekyll presses on and creates a serum that transforms him into another being entirely, that of Mr. Hyde. The experiment seems fair at first, but quickly spirals out of hand as Hyde's violence cannot be contained. How can Hyde be stopped and what will happen to the budding romance between Jekyll and his colleague's daughter? By itself, this film is pretty amazing. The makeup effects are ahead of their time and there's a special effect involving a tarantula that impressed me greatly. The acting is good -- a bit exaggerated at times, but that was simply the style of the day. Even the picture quality is impressive... clearly a lot of love and funding went into this project and it paid off in spades. Any future Jekyll/Hyde film would have to be compared to this one, and it would be a tough film to beat.I had the special treat of catching it at the Music Box Massacre festival at the Music Box theater in Chicago. What made this great besides a silver screen presentation? Live organ accompaniment. For the entire length of the film, the organist kept us and our emotions moving from the romantic to the terrifying... without missing a note. Silent films may have faded away and will likely never regain any level of popularity, but if you do get the chance to see one, this is the proper way. Prerecorded music has nothing on the sound of a live organ. I have to give full credit to organist Mark Noller for such an amazing and inspiring performance.This version of \"Jekyll and Hyde\", more than any other, stands out as a historic plank in the annals of horror and film. While it could be argued that other versions are better or more in touch with a modern audience -- and there are dozens of remakes and reimaginings to choose from -- this is one that should be seen by any serious horror fan or film scholar. Techniques used in it, such as the makeup, could still be influential today. Newer is not always better and while we today think of \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" as the early horror masterpieces, this one should not be ruled out.", "That this famous film version of the Stephenson classic, perhaps the first really great American thriller, was enormously aided by John Barrymore's extraordinary abilities is universally appreciated. Nearly forgotten now, however, is the fact the movie's success was also due to the exceptional beauty, marvellously captured, of Ziegfeld Follies showgirl Martha Mansfield in one of her first leading screen roles, that of the ingenue love interest to Barrymore's Dr. Jekyll incarnation.The picture's period setting provided the ideal backdrop for Mansfield's delicate blonde looks and delightfully coy demeanor. It also gave the budding favorite ample excuse to wear the romantic chiffon creations of the couturiere \"Lucile\" (Lady Duff-Gordon), which are seen to best advantage in the dinner party scenes. To coincide with the release of \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (March 28, 1920), Martha Mansfield was sufficiently publicity-savvy to pose in her latest Lucile gowns for a double page photo-spread in \"Harper's Bazaar\" (March 1920).Mansfield's popularity in the Paramount horror film lead her to be chosen by producer David Selznick to succeed Olive Thomas as the studio's top star upon the latter's shocking death in Paris. Tragically Mansfield was destined for a similar end, for only four years later she died of burns sustained when her costume caught fire while shooting a movie on location in Texas.", "Today, John Barrymore is best known to those who know his name at all, either as a drunken buffoon who got a lot of bad publicity during the last decade of his life or as the grandfather of Drew Barrymore, who was born many decades after he died. But if you look at his theatrical and screen career prior to those sad last years, you will find that he was a definite superstar, once the most popular actor during his heyday. This film version of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel is very different than other \"Jekyll and Hydes\", similar in plot to the very popular Broadway musical that has gained a cult following, but with very noticeable differences.The character of Dr. Henry Jekyll is presented as a very noble man who takes care of the poor and downtrodden, and whose desire to do good for his fellow man results in his downfall due to his experiments studying the psychology of the good and evil in everybody. The film doesn't take long to turn Dr Jekyll into the hideous Mr. Hyde, and for special effects that are now over a hundred years old, the film is quite impressive in many ways. While there are some comical elements in how Mr. Hyde first appears, it's obvious that in 1920, those effects would scare the bejeebers out of its audience. Mr. Hyde is a hideous villain, lascivious and perverse, and his crimes quite gruesome. The women involved with both characters truly have to deal with monstrous actions by Mr. Hyde, even though there are very subtle clues about how tortured the evil side of Dr. Jekyll really is.This film truly stands the time as a brilliant piece of cinema, filled with visuals that are stunning, with Barrymore giving a performance that undoubtly in 1920 would have won him an Oscar had they been around at the time. The supporting cast is filled with unknowns, but they are all brilliant, and even the minor roles show off a dark society at the time that wasn't at all romantic or beautiful. The print that I saw of the film, in the public domain, has a beautiful music score, and it is very easy to watch even for people who are not fans of silent movies. The ending certainly haunted me, and I must call this one of the greatest silent movies ever made, not to mention one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Arachnophone should be aware that there is a scene involving a giant spider, one quite frightening in its nightmarish presentation.", "My above comment is NOT because I dislike silents--in fact, I have probably reviewed more silent films than just about anyone on IMDb. No, this is just a case where the later version is just more interesting--probably due to its \"Pre-Code\" sensibilities that gave a lot more psychological depth to the story. However, none of the versions I have yet seen really come close to the quality of the original book--a common problem when you adapt classic stories to the screen.This is a very famous horror film starring John Barrymore. I have heard and read raves about his performance and how great he was without the use of significant amounts of makeup. Although I love Barrymore, I really don't agree and think he overacted. Now this didn't ruin the film--for a silent it's still very good. It's just that other silent horror films such as NOSFERATU or THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA are just better and the acting is a bit more restrained. However, despite this, the sets are good and action just fine, so this would still be a decent film to watch.By the way, there are MANY versions of this film since it's in the public domain. I have a videotape with no accompanying music (yuck) and got a DVD from the library with BAD organ accompaniment. If it's available, try to find one with a better score--the music I heard was just very flat and uninspiring.", "This is one of the earliest of many, many (better say endless) Jekyll & Hyde adaptations, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the best. The main reason why this version pales in comparison with the celebrated 1931-version is because the narration of Robert Louis Stevenson's story never at one point rises above the basics. The film opens terribly slow and you have to wait long and patiently before it gets to the essence of Stevenson's legendary writings, namely Dr. Jekyll's growing obsession to bring out the dark side that hides in ever human being. However, and this is truly remarkable, off ALL the Jekyll & Hyde movie-versions I've seen thus far, this 85-year-old piece of cinema strangely brings forward the spookiest Hyde-monster ever. In fact, John Barrymore simply dominates the whole movie and he clearly enjoyed the sequences where he turns into the malicious and long-fingered monster. The transformation scenes are amazingly uncanny for their time and the camera-work is pure Expressionism. With a slightly more creative approach of the story-material, this could have been the greatest silent horror film ever.", "This has just about everything you could ask for in a silent screen version of the classic story \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". John Barrymore was a fine choice to play the dual role, and the detailed production is capped off by special visual effects that are very good for 1920. The mood is built up slowly and effectively from the beginning, and a good supporting cast helps out, especially Martha Mansfield and Nita Naldi as the two very different women who are affected by the doctor's bizarre experiment.One of the challenges involved in filming the story at the time would have been the difficulty of communicating Stevenson's very interesting thoughts and themes about the two contrasting sides of human nature. Although of necessity much of this is communicated here with the use of inter-titles, Barrymore's performance (particularly as the doctor) and the visual effects are also often used to emphasize the key ideas.Barrymore must have enjoyed playing the role, especially the part of Hyde, and the detailed makeup job on Hyde makes him look hideously sinister. But the part of Jekyll, though less flamboyant and less eye-grabbing, probably demanded even more skill, in order to depict his descent into temptation and his torment afterward.This version also has a period look and feel to it that fit in very well with the story. There have been many other movie versions of the popular story, and there are several good ones to choose from, but this one can still stand with just about any of them.", "This is one of those movies I watch every so often. I was impressed with it the first time I saw it. It wears very well. It showed that what many find laughable in silent film can be quite dramatic and well done. The acting here is subdued and very persuasive. John Barrymore carries off the transitions to Hyde very well. He uses his body and his face to made this work. An old coat, a slouch hat, and a distorted face do the job. There is also the famous scene where Jekyll must force himself to drink the potion that will release his evil side. He moves toward it and then away; finally, he drinks it. Some find his gyrations and anguished expressions to be a bit much, but we have to remember what actors were trying to project at this time. Much of what takes place is in front of the apartment of Jekyll. Eventually, the evil takes dominance and Henry can no longer control what he is becoming. This is when he begins to lose his immortal soul, his greatest fear. If you see this, you will be captivated by what a good story it is and what a good actor John Barrymore was.", "This 1920 production was the work of Famous Players (later Paramount) and the studio's early style of imitating a stage look limits this film visually and in terms of its acting, which is not subtle.  However, Barrymore delivers with panache and flamboyance as the dual personality doctor.  His makeup and mannerisms as Hyde are really grotesque, providing reason enough to watch the film.  The sets are also very well done; you can almost see the slime of grunge coming off the pedestals and door posts, very similar to the look of Universal's later \"Phantom of the Opera\" w/ Lon Chaney.  But what with the static camera, this film comes off as quite a sleep inducer, and seems a lot longer than it is.  Still, wroth seeing for Barrymore's performance and excellent makeup.", "The story itself is classic status, with an iconic titular character that is been imitated many a time but rarely equalled and a story that still chills me to the bone every time I read it. This 1920 silent film is very effective. For my money the best Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is the 1931 film with Fredric March(I was disappointed in the 1941 film with Spencer Tracy personally). This still doesn't stop me from really liking this though. Some of it is rather slow, and not helped by some sequences that could've been shorter or excised. However, the costumes, sets and photography are wonderful and not at all dated, all the pivotal scenes are done with the correct atmosphere- true the transformation sequence is overdone slightly but it is also quite scary- and the ending doesn't disappoint either. The direction is skillful, and John Barrymore is superb and genuinely frightening especially with the eyes and the hands. Overall, very effective. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "I find it interesting that this classic & 'nearly' definitive motion picture of Robert L. Stevenson's short novella, STRANGE CASE OF DR JEKYLL & MR HYDE was made in Long Island New York financed by Paramount/Famous Players-Lasky. Thus it's not 'really' a Hollywood movie in the literal sense. The financial cord of Paramount, as with all of the big studios, was also situated in New York City. However the legend of this film has come down through the decades intact withstanding it's comparison to later versions of which it undoubtedly influences.How personal this film must have been to John Barrymore. It seems to have been more than an assignment for him. He brought plants from his apartment to use in the film, he transported sets & costumes from one of his hit plays to be filmed in a flashback sequence, he was miming a story that had been done by the great stage actor Richard Mansfield whom was acquainted with his late father Maurice Barrymore. Interesting enough Barrymore would film another great Mansfield stage success four years later, BEAU BRUMMEL, which was Barrymore's first truly Hollywood made film. One wonders whether the choice to cast Martha Mansfield as Jekyll's love interest had anything to do with her name being Mansfield. There has never come up any evidence that she was related to Richard Mansfield but her name on movie theater marquees for the film must have looked familiar to older movie goers at the time who remembered the great theater actor who died in 1907 and never lived to film even a primitive version of DJ&MH himself. It must have been a good selling point. So John Barrymore as well as the Drew-Barrymore theatrical clan must have known Richard Mansfield on an intimate level at one time or another. I've always counted this film & JB's performance as an homage to Richard Mansfield and the acting profession in general. Perhaps, though it is not on record, a young JB might have seen Mansfield on stage doing Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde.The film's directorial credit is officially given to John S Robertson and writing credits to Clara Beranger(Wm DeMille's wife) but certainly J.Barrymore added touches here and there to spark up the production such as the above mentioned items he brought or transported to the film set. And also JB's winning portrayal at the time on the Broadway stage as Richard the 3rd performed at night while he filmed DJ&MH during the day. The make-ups for Richard the 3rd & Mr Hyde are strikingly similar when viewing photographs of JB as the two characters. Hyde, while favoring Richard, is truly the more severe of the two roles, and needed to be to put the character over on film. Another plus this film has is that it is made closer to the 1886 timeline of Stevenson's Victorian novella than the later feature length productions of 1931, 1941 and on. The sets where Hyde cavorts look nothing but like an inner London Victorian slum. Also some of the sets where Dr Jekyll has dinner with his elitist friends are accurately Victorian.Director Robertson along with cameraman Roy Overbaugh keep the production flowing along especially when Hyde is on the screen. The first transformation is a classic, and pretty well known by historians & silent movie buffs. For those who haven't seen the movie I wont disclose no spoilers about the first transformation. Later transformations are accomplished by cameraman Overbaugh with stop-motion-photography and some very smooth double exposures such as in the spider-on-bed sequence. And also some good acting from JB.Lastly if the original music score could be resurrected and performed with the film today, then a close approximation as to what 1920 audiences saw & heard could be experienced by today's audiences. Most home video copies put accompanied music or awfully scored music that is wrong for the film. Some video releases, wisely don't put any music score on the video which oddly forces your attention to the movie.", "Directed by John S. Robertson and starring matin\u00e9e idol John Barrymore in the dual title role, 1920's DR. JECKYLL & MR. HYDE is sometimes described as the \"first American horror film.\" That description is more than a little problematic, but whether it was or it wasn't, DR. JECKYLL AND MR. HYDE certainly put the horror genre on the Hollywood map.Whether or not you happen to like this particular version of the famous Robert Louis Stevenson tale will depend a great deal upon your tolerance for the change in acting styles that has occurred between the silent and the modern era. Some silent stars--Lillian Gish, Ramon Novarro, and Louise Brooks leap to mind--were remarkably subtle and worked to create a new style of acting appropriate to the screen, but most actors played very broadly. John Barrymore, considered one of the greatest actors of his day, is among the latter, and was noted for his larger-than-life performances on stage. He brings that same expansiveness to the screen, where it inevitably feels \"too big\" to the modern viewer.At the time, Barrymore's transformation into the evil Mr. Hyde was considered shocking in its realism, but today these celebrated scenes are more likely to induce snickers than thrills--as will much of Hyde's make-up, which seems excessive to the modern sensibility. Even so, there are aspects of the film which survive quite well, scenes in which one is permitted a glimpse into the power this film once had. For Barrymore's Hyde is, for all his bizarre ugliness, a remarkably seductive creature--and Barrymore uses his hands and eyes in a remarkable way. One feels the sexual pull as much as one feels the revulsion.The 1920 DR. JEKYLL & MR. HYDE is available in several VHS and DVD releases. Some of these are quite good, but I generally recommend the Kino version, which offers a good picture, good soundtrack, and several interesting bonuses. Although other releases may seem attractive in price, it's been my experience that you generally get what you pay for.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, reviewer", "I've always thought that the popularization of Sigmund Freud's theory of the ego and the id helped directly with the popularity of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde. Nowhere will you see it better expressed without voice than by John Barrymore in the silent screen version of the classic.In fact no player since Richard Mansfield who originated the acting role on stage was better acclaimed than Barrymore up to that time. Even without the use of his magnificent vocal instrument along with some superb makeup he carries off both the decent scientist Jekyll and the beast within he calls Hyde. No accident Stevenson chose that name. Hyde is something we do with that part of our nature.This is a short feature film for its time, still all the elements of the story are contained. The women in Jekyll/Hyde's life are Marian Mansfield as the decent girl he's engaged to and Nita Naldi as the Music Hall entertainer who Hyde tortures beyond endurance.One of John Barrymore's best silent films. Do not miss this version of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde.", "This 1920s version of Stevenson's famous novel \"Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" has flashes of brilliance, particularly in John Barrymore's portrayal of Mr Hyde, the depraved doppelganger of uptight scientist Dr Jekyll.The transformation sequences are not as technically complex as in versions to come, but Barrymore does a good job at twisting his features grotesquely before a dissolve into full make-up occurs. What is striking and quite surprising is that unlike the modern depictions of Hyde in films such as \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" (and also it's graphic novel original) as a huge, muscular Hulk-like creature or even the were-wolf like creatures in later versions, here he is more akin to the ratlike Nosferatu memorably played by Max Schreck in Murnau's 1922 classic. This is fitting as Mr Hyde is not a literal monster, but the manifestation of the id.What is quite surprising, although this may be very naive on my part, is the way the film deals with this idea of Jekyll's suppressed sexual and hedonistic desires. Jekyll creates Mr Hyde with the help of science in order to be able to frequent the bawdy dance halls and back street bars and brothels which he can't do as Jekyll. Hyde, like Nosferatu, exudes a primal sexuality shown in one scene where he seduces two prostitutes in a bar, maybe hinting at some of Jekyll's repressed fantasies. I was surprised just how clear this was in the film, although I think Hollywood censorship began well after this era.Visually, there aren't many exceptional moments, though the London streets of Mr Hyde's world are suitably murky. I did like the way the opening title cards introduced each character separately as they entered the story, complete with the actor's name, and many of the title cards had expressive pictures surrounding them which complemented the story. The supporting cast is pretty average, although Martha Mansfield is suitably pretty as Jekyll's beloved. Worth a look as an example of early American horror.", "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920)Don't let the flat beginning to the movie turn you off. Once Barrymore begins taking on both roles (Jekyll and Hyde), with the famous first transformation about 27 minutes into the film, it only gets better and better. The fear within him, his inability to cope, the hiding and general mayhem, and the gradual awakening of the good doctor's friends builds to a terrific second half.It's silent, yes, but it doesn't need too many intertitles. The lighting and sets are really nice, there is a lot of solid, parallel editing, and the results both in the narrative and in the spatial construction of the film from set to set is complex and sophisticated.Look for a classic (and simple) use of warm toned and blue toned sections of film, as characters move inside and out (inside is yellowy as if from lamplight). This not only adds mood, it helps you keep track of where you are. The locations are limited--no roaming the streets of old London here--but they work to advance the ideas.John Barrymore's performance is energetic and fearless. The famous first film appearance of 1920s vamp star Nina Naldi is a landmark, too, though she appears only briefly. The rest of the cast is fine, though in some cases noticeably stiff. Director John S. Robinson is not known for any landmarks besides this one, and even this was not the first adaptation of Stevenson's short novel (that was apparently a 1910 Danish version). But the stakes were raised here, only to be matched and bettered, overall, by the Moumalian version of 1931, an early sound movie with Frederic March in the main role. John Barrymore was a ham, at heart, and this was a role where you didn't have to worry about overdoing the part, so the 1920 version is pretty amazing just to see him act full tilt.The meaning of the story goes beyond the duality of human nature, and the inability to control pure evil. Toward the beginning, Dr. Jekyll is accused of being a studious bore, and he needed to have a life. The only way to win over temptation was to fall into it, said a friend, and this is the crux of it, really, the idea that you need to follow your own sense of good. Peer pressure never had such fast, awful effects as it did on the tender hearted, experimentally minded young doctor.", "Man going against the natural order is a common subject for books. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in the 1880s, about 60+ years after Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.\" Instead of a created outside entity, however, Jekyll and Hyde deals in a split personality.Jekyll and Hyde has been done in every imaginable medium, many times in film. Of all of them, perhaps the definitive J&H is John Barrymore in the remarkable 1920 version. There is also the 1932 version directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Frederic March, whose Mr. Hyde was somewhat simian-looking.And then there is the MGM version, where Somerset Maugham, on the set, turned to director Victor Fleming and asked,\"Which one is he now, Jekyll or Hyde?\"The Barrymore film is silent. Handsome, noble-looking, with ramrod straight posture, John Barrymore makes the transformation to the bent- over, hideously ugly and cruel Mr. Hyde by going into horrific contortions. By today's standards, these may seem over the top, as acting style has become more subtle. For Barrymore, this is unusual, as the majority of his performances appear modern even today.What the 1920 film achieved before computers and CGI is amazing, so smooth are many of the Jekyll/Hyde transformations. And make no mistake, this Hyde is genuinely terrifying.The rest of the cast isn't as good as Barrymore. Again, it's difficult to judge especially in silents, where widening eyes, an arm across a mouth is the start of a scream, twisting lips indicate cruelty -- all very different.Nita Naldi plays a music hall performer. Dressed in a Spanish-type costume and showing some cleavage, she does what is supposed to be dance, waving her arms and turning around, occasionally taking a step right or left. Pretty Martha Mansfield is Millicent; sadly, she died from burns when she was 24.John Barrymore performances are always worth seeing, and this one firmly established him as a film star. Don't miss it.", "I'd never seen a silent movie in a theater until last night. The Usher Hall in Edinburgh screened this 90-year-old horror to a large, nearly sold-out, audience with live music. It was a digital projection made from a composite print that hadn't been restored. The film was full of nicks and dirt and scratches, but it didn't bother me, it added to atmosphere I guess.John Barrymore (Drew's granddad) plays Dr. Jekyll, a man who has devoted his life to good. His friends tease him on his purity and encourage him to let his hair down once in a while, perhaps with a hooker or two. Instead of taking this sound advice Jekyll creates a potion that turns him into Mr. Hyde, a monstrous character who is supposed to represent man's inner beast.The \"horror\" didn't really have much of an effect on me. Hyde doesn't do anything considerably evil, but I did find him creepy to look at. The performances are all about theater and overacting in the absence of dialogue and the actors did a good job in this regard. The photography and set design was impressive too but rather undermined by the decrepit nature of the composite print.Though we should be grateful that the film still exists in good enough condition to screen publicly. This was the 3rd screen adaptation of Robert Lewis Stevenson's novella, the first two have been lost and will likely never be seen again.I guess you could say that they are \"Hyding\"."], "tt0011135": [], "tt0011221": ["This was a film that I don't really recall hearing about before looking into horror films from the 1920s. For my podcast, I'm doing Centennial Club episodes of pairing two films 100 years apart and so I was knocking off the next film from 1920 here. The synopsis on the Internet Movie Database isn't that good, but it is about a woman that uses her charm to persuade men to do things they normally wouldn't.We start this movie in the room of a painter, William Percy (Harald Paulsen). He just completed his masterpiece of a famous heathen priestess from a legend. Percy has been moody since it has been completed. His friends are worried about him and want him to rid himself of his creation. Lord Melo (Ernst Gronau) inquires about purchasing the painting, but he's denied. Percy's two friends inform him they'll convince him to change his mind. Percy then falls asleep and the painting comes to life behind him.It takes us to telling the story of Genuine (Fern Andra). She was the priestess of her tribe, but they're conquered by rivals. She's taken and sold into slavery. It is then she is purchased by Lord Melo, who falls in love with her. He keeps her hidden away in a room in his basement. He is doing this though to protect her, as he feels the world around them is ugly and brutal.Every day at noon, Guyard (John Gottowt) comes to his home to cut his hair. Lord Melo doesn't have much, so it is pretty much getting it shaved where no hair is present. Guyard draws the attention of those around him and they start to inquire. The barber goes home one day inform his nephew, Florian (Hans Heinrich von Twardoski), that he's prepared for him to be his apprentice. Percy (Paulsen) also wants to visit with his grandfather he hasn't seen in some time. Lord Melo agrees, but is curious to how Genuine will react.It all comes to a head though when Guyard is summoned before the magistrate due to the townspeople being nosey. He sends Florian to cut Lord Melo's hair for disastrous results. Genuine discovers how to escape and she involves herself in everything that is happening where she uses her charm to make Florian as well as Percy do things they normally wouldn't and it gets out of hand.Now my original viewing of this was a 44 minute cut I have on DVD. I happened to check YouTube to find the full 88 minute cut available and have now watched both. I'm glad that I did, because some of my problems were resolved with that second viewing. Not all of them though.I would have to say that my issue with this movie is that I don't really think this woman is a vampire. There's a scene where we see that after Percy's encounter with her, he does look quite wild and pale like he could have had blood drained from him. We don't get any indications that happened. It is possible that she could be more of an energy sucking vampire. I actually think though it is more that what he did bothers him so deeply as well as his love for Genuine and fearing he's lost that. The men that she messed with do seem to be at their wits end after their encounters for sure. If anything, I would say that she is more of a witch. It makes more sense as the priestess of a tribe of people that were wild and she has the ability to make these men do what she says or they lose their mind for not doing so. I really just think she's using her sexually as a weapon and this is how the men that created this are explaining it.Regardless of what Genuine really is I think this movie does a really good job of creating a dream like atmosphere. This doesn't do as well in creating that dream-like atmosphere with the sets like the director Robert Weine did with his other film from this year, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Both are German Expressionism, but I just think that other film is stronger in what it's doing there if I'm going to be perfectly honest. That's not to say this doesn't do similar things though.After my second viewing, I did find this a bit more entertaining. A lot of it now is that I understand what the movie is getting at. I like this idea of telling us this legend through a dream that Percy is having. Everyone that is at his place before he goes to sleep is players in that story. I do think it is a bit problematic though. I still found myself bored during the latter half of the film. I also didn't like the ending to the legend that is being told. It really is a tragedy, but I still believe my misogynistic take on it stands. I was satisfied in having the book-end to how things start and where things end.That will take me to the acting, which I thought was okay. I do think that Andra was really good here. She is taking on a strong feminine character and I really liked it. She has a good look about her and I think the costume choices also helped there. Twardowski and Paulsen play similar roles, which I thought were good. They both lose themselves in Genuine and I thought that worked to show her strength. Gronau and the rest of the cast also rounded this out for what was needed, but no one really stood out to be honest.I've already touched on the effects slightly. We don't really get any in this movie, which doesn't surprise me with how early into cinema we are. They could do things, but this movie didn't necessarily require that. I did think that we got some interesting backdrops to some scenes, but nothing as strong like from Dr. Caligari. There is a dreamlike feel to some of the scenes, especially where Genuine is kept. I did think that her look as I said showed how wild she was. There is also a scene where we get superimposed images that are haunting someone. It is a common technique from the era, but it worked for what they needed. The cinematography was fine in my opinion as well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I'll once again say that I don't know if the selections we're hearing are the ones that the movie intended, but I dug what was used here. They did get a bit repetitive, as it felt like they used a couple of them over and over again, but I do have to reiterate that it worked. The selections were unnerving and really made me feel uncomfortable. This also seemed to help the atmosphere of the movie.Now with that said, this isn't my favorite from this year or from Wiene. I do think there are some interesting aspects to it. I like how strong of a character that Andra is with her portrayal of Genuine. This does have a misogynistic take on it, which I can't fault the movie too much due to how long ago it came out. I had some issues with character development and story, but that was cleared up by viewing the longer version. I still found it to be boring though during the latter part. The visuals are fine and the DVD I have has a solid soundtrack to accompany it. I would still say that this is above average though. There are some good elements, but just lacking a bit.7.5/10", "First off, I am reviewing the \"43 minute condensed version\" that is found on KINO's \"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\" so this is the longest version currently available on video.It's hard to talk plot line since I have no idea how the somewhat tenuous plot of this version compares to the apparently complete version locked up in Germany, but I can say that the subtitle \"A Tale of a Vampire\" is erroneous as there is no vampire in this film. The original subtitle is \"Tragedy of a Strange House,\" which is much more accurate to the film in the version I own.While there is very little to go on story-wise, the set design and imagery is fantastic! While of course, the sets look like painted cardboard (because they are), one must ignore that fact and look at the pure artistry put into the set design. There are some truly disturbing images, such as a skeleton with a clock for a head. And while actual camera movement is absent, this is an early example of a film that allows some action to occur at the fringes of the lens instead of dead center (like you are watching a play). This allows for some interesting and startling entrances from Genuine herself.Speaking of startling, there is a scene in a slave market that features two women in a gauze-like material. You can see their breasts clearly, one of the earliest examples of nudity in a mainstream film. The nudity isn't highlighted and isn't used for eroticism, but I was surprised to see nipples so clearly in a movie from 1920.I also must mention the brilliant score. While it is repetitive, it isn't annoying. It seems a perfect fit for such a strange little film. I found the score to be quite complementary to the imagery, and very beautiful as well.This may not be \"Caligari,\" but it shouldn't be dismissed as it seems to have been by others on this forum. And in its full form--if we ever get to see it--it may just be another \"Caligari.\" Short on plot, but a hallucinogenic, dreamlike, and fascinating trip into a strange world. Try it!", "I\u2019ve been wanting to give this a whirl ever since acquiring it six years ago \u2013 as part of the Kino edition of the same director\u2019s THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1920). However, the result (without taking into account its obvious narrative gaps, being incomplete in this version) is nowhere near as groundbreaking or even compelling as that earlier classic \u2013 despite the comparable Expressionist look (including a clock standing in for the face of a skeleton[!] and which is still its best quality).The plot revolves around a femme fatale called Genuine \u2013 hence, the vampire of the title is not of the blood-sucking variety \u2013 who had actually been the high priestess of some cult. Due to a clash between factions, she ends up in a slave market (featuring surprising but discreet nudity) and is eventually bought by an eccentric old man (among other things, he likes to doze off while being shaved daily!), who keeps the girl in the cellar of his \u2018notorious\u2019 mansion so as to shelter her from the vices of modern life; incidentally, one is never quite sure in which era this is all supposed to be taking place \u2013 since the dapper but doddering old man has an Arab, with painted bare chest, for a servant! The irony, then, is that the girl\u2019s own nature \u2013 she has a feral countenance and wears a skimpy striped outfit! \u2013 is infinitely more dangerous to the young men she enslaves (one of whom sports a highly anachronistic Duran Duran hairdo!). These, in fact, are somehow driven mad (as it stands, the details aren\u2019t very clear \u2013 particularly with respect to the old man\u2019s nephew); when the son of his exclusive barber is similarly afflicted, the latter rouses the populace against her and \u2013 in a scene which basically replicates Cesare the somnambulist\u2019s fate from the aforementioned THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI \u2013 she dies in the ensuing pursuit.In conclusion, the treatment afforded the film isn\u2019t sufficiently gripping to rate it higher than a mere curio at this juncture; besides, it\u2019s all the more disappointing coming from Wiene (who, besides CALIGARI also made the equally influential THE HANDS OF ORLAC [1924]). By the way, another interesting effort of his \u2013 the Dostoyevsky adaptation RASKOLNIKOV (1923) \u2013 will soon be released on DVD by the budget label Alpha (under the alternate title of CRIME AND PUNISHMENT)\u2026", "The same director, cinematographer and writer of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" made this subsequent picture, \"Genuine\". Likewise, it is also an Expressionist film (one of the few made during Weimar Germany, contrary to what Lotte Eisner and the use by some of \"expressionism\" as an umbrella term for almost all German cinema of the period might suggest). Additionally, similar to \"Caligari\", the main body of \"Genuine\" is framed as a dream. Yet, I wasn't engulfed into the universe of it as I was with \"Caligari\".The story, although just as peculiar, isn't as involving, which is unfortunately probably, in part, because the Kino release is only a condensed version. The framing of scenes is just as prosaic and theatrical as that in \"Caligari\"--if not more so. As well, the stylized acting seems more overdone and obtrusive this time. But, more importantly, the problem is the sets, which I can't see the entire version improving much upon. The Expressionist set designs are equally strange, with odd angels and geometric shapes. The production, however, leaves too much space open and unfilled, which is the largest reason that \"Genuine\" isn't as involving, or captivating, as \"Caligari\".", "partial nudity This film is currently available from archive.org, as it's in the public domain. And, it is the 43 minute version.Apart from the unusual set and costume design that has been influenced by the German Expressionist movement, there isn't a lot to this film I would recommend. In fact, I think it's all kind of silly and trite. The story is about an irresistible woman named 'Genuine' and she apparently is so hot and wonderful that men MUST do her bidding. And, when she asks them to kill others or themselves, they do in order to prove their love and obedience towards her. This strange plots combined with LOTS of overacting (especially in the lovemaking scenes) make for a movie that is bizarre and pretty silly. I was not all that impressed and think the film won't interest anyone but the most ardent silent movie fans. Now I am probably among the most prolific reviewers of silents, and it didn't interest me a whole lot either! By the way, like many films (particularly European ones) of this era, there is some partial nudity in this film that might surprise you. Sadly, even this wasn't enough to generate any excitement in this film!", "For director Robert Wiene, he yearned to duplicate his success by hiring \"Caligari's\" writer, set designer & cinematographer for his next project, September 1920's \"Genuine: The Tale of a Vampire.\" Using the same framing structure, the tale has a former painter falling asleep while reading a horror novel. His dream is about his portrait of a high priestess, Genuine, hanging on his wall above him. The dreamlike quality of the movie is similar to \"Caligari\" with its surreal sets and tone.The term vampire in those days in cinema meant a woman taking the financial pants off of unsuspecting men. Such was the femme fatale Genuine, the subject of Wiene's film. Unfortunately for the director and Decia Studios, \"Genuine\" was a colossal flop. But that didn't stop him from directing well into the 1930's, producing some classics along the way.", "...yes, it's from the same director, Robert Wiene, whose landmark THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI was released earlier the very same year, 1920; and, yes, much of the same cinematic technique created for CALIGARI was used here as well. The main differences between the two utterly defeat any chance that GENUINE, at least in the 43-minute \"condensation\" that appears on the 2002 Kino DVD release, would ever be a tenth as watchable as CALIGARI (or, for that matter, THE HEARTS OF AGE, Orson Welles' self-described \"amusement\" that spoofed all the surrealist silent European cinema concocted by Wiene, F.W. Murnau, Salvador Dali and the like). First, the sets and makeup of the players are not as flamboyantly odd this time around. Second, the pacing is far too slow for the story. Third, the story is itself far too bizarre and convoluted for a casual viewer to find any interest in; CALIGARI's is relatively straightforward in comparison. If you want a pre-NOSFERATU take on vampires, track down the DVD of LES VAMPIRES instead...", "Robert Wiene repeats the techniques he used in \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" with far less success in \"Genuine\".  His looming architectures and broad swaths of darkness are glaringly at odds with the utterly ridiculous story of the seductress-priestess-wild girl brought to unsuspecting Europe.  There are some striking visual effects, such as the jungle of branches where Genuine climbs up and up to escape from her prison, but they don't add up to anything. (I should note that only fragments, adding up to about a half hour, survive of this movie; but I suspect that the parts I didn't see wouldn't have added any deeper meaning.)", "I caught this years back at the Paris Cinematheque hoping to find something of interest from the director of Caligari. It was a disappointment in just about every way for me. First, the film at its original length seemed to go on forever. The elements were there, granted, but they didn't combine as they did in the previous film. I had the feeling of watching a film that was going through all the necessary steps but missing all the points. It was more an exercise in style which blindly followed all the guidelines but missed going anywhere. On the other hand, and perhaps unfairly to subsequent films, \"Caligari\" was a one-of-a-kinder that left no space for a sequel. Period.Curtis Stotlar", "GENUINE, THE TRAGEDY OF A VAMPIRE (1920), a German expressionist horror from director Robert Wiene - who brought us the classic CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI - isn't really a vampire film at all despite that title; in fact, I'm not quite sure what it is I've just watched. There are two versions, feature length and half that, and I watched the full version of this rarity on Youtube. The story is about a painter who dozes off in a strange house, at which point the subject of his painting - a wild woman called Genuine - comes to life and her bizarre story is subsequently narrated. There's quite an exotic feel to this one, with imposing figures and surprising nudity at times, but it's also testing stuff, with some nice spooky visuals but lacking the kind of concrete narrative and weird dream-like atmosphere that made CALIGARI so interesting to watch. There's some macabre set design and inventive direction, but the main character is a bit of a dullard, the female villain isn't really a villain at all, and certainly not a vampire, and of course the ending turns out to be a cop-out. Not one I enjoyed; perhaps in a better print things would be different, or maybe the shortened version plays better.", "Watching this late at night, I kept dozing off and then rewinding to see what I'd missed. This woman who is sometimes seen as a vampire, has incredible power over men. She can get them to do what she wants, even to the point of killing themselves or others. She was kidnapped and sold into slavery and has this rage and craziness in her eyes. Men can't resist her and fall into her traps. We don't know what her motives are other than to seek revenge on those who put her in this position. There is a lot of overacting (a hallmark of the silent cinema anyway) and very little plot. Robert Wiene (\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligary\") is just getting started and some of the cinematography is interesting. But over all, it just doesn't do much to captivate the viewer.", "\"Genuine\" or, in the longer version, \"Genuine: A Tale of a Vampire\" is a German movie from 1920, so it soon has its 100th anniversary. It is still silent and, even more obvious, in black-and-white. Director Robert Wiene and writer Carl Mayer have worked (together) on a couple more fairly famous silent film classic, especially \"Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari\", which also came out in 1920. Their effort with \"Genuine\", however, seems quite forgettable to me. The vampire did look scary I must admit and we have to give them thumbs-up because this was actually done before Nosferatu, bit still the action, story and acting were just not too interesting. There are 2 versions out there, a long one that runs for almost 90 minutes and a 44-minute version, the one I watched. Actually, I only found the short version. But I am perfectly fine with it as, like I wrote before, this was a mediocre film at best and **/***** is almost still a generous rating. No need to watch another 45 minutes of it. I do not recommend \"Genuine\", a genuinely uninteresting film,", "Genuine was directed by Robert Weine, and released the same year as his more much famous film The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari, which vastly overshadowed it.This is much more of an abstract fantasy artfilm, as opposed Caligari.And the background scenery just doesn't have that stylistic pop that the latter film did.So it's not surprising that this film has since become lost in obscurity.The story centers around a tribal priestess who was captured and sold as a slave to a wealthy hermit.The hermit keeps her locked away from the world in a basement oasis...but she yearns for love and freedom.Things take a turn when the estranged son of the wealthy \"barber\" returns home.He and Genuine immediately fall in love with one another...and, well...the old man ends up dead.Now, they control his empire together...but the townsfolk have become suspicious.So their fate lies at the hands of the lynch mob that is forming at their doorstep...It's a bit hard to follow along with, which might be another reason it failed to garner as much popularity as did Caligari.I think it is have been suggested that everything was going on in the head of the guy in the white suit...the guy whose father claimed Genuine was a witch...which inevitably leads to the formation of the lynch mob at the end.There are a couple of odd scenes incorporated into the film that I didn't really know what to make of...which led me to become slightly confused about certain aspects of the narrative.And the \"vampire\" subtitle doesn't make much sense, either.Because she doesn't seem to be a vampire in any way shape or form...and noone ever accuses her of being a vampire...though I suppose you could argue she does have a lustful allure akin to most of the classic cinematic vampires.When all is said and done, it's not necessarily a bad film.But it's not great either.I feel like if they had lengthened it a little, in order to develop the story a little more...it would have been better.Because as it is, it's really just kind of mediocre...especially in the shadow of a beast like The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari.The highlight here, for me, was the actress playing Genuine.She is pretty badass.But the whole fantastical otherworldly quality that the film has is cool too.In the end, however, you can't help but feel like you just sat through a relatively \"meh\" experience.4.5 out of 10.", "Genuine, die Trag\u00f6die eines seltsamen Hauses (Genuine, the Tragedy of a Strange House) was Robert Wiene's follow-up to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, with writer Carl Mayer, cinematographer Willy Hameister and production designer Cesar Klein returned to work on this vampiric film.Genuine is not a true vampire, but instead a succubus that drains the souls of men, even destroying the life of the man who has painted her as this movie begins. Before the movie ends, she will cause men to murder one another and drive others to nearly kill themselves with her charms.Genuine was played by Fern Andra, an acrobat whose physical acting is incredible. She's a mystery of a woman who destroys men simply because she enjoys doing so. At first a savage captured from a tribe and kept by a rich old man, she soon takes over the man's home and earns the ire of everyone in the surrounding area.Is Genuine real? Is she an idea? Is she art? Is the story in the film a dream? While Dr. Caligari was a success, this film was seen as too much art for art's sake. I think even back in 1920, popular audiences could often be quite dumb.", "I've just viewed the Image DVD of CALIGARI, with commentary by Mike Budd. This DVD also includes excerpts from GENUINE. While the snippets included are pretty strange and disconnected, they show a major similarity between the two films -- that is, the \"frame\" structure of the story. CALIGARI's frame is that it is a story told by a madman. In GENUINE, it appears that the story is a \"dream\" experienced by a young man who has fallen asleep reading his favorite novel. What I saw of GENUINE makes it seem the young man's favorite author was Sacher-Masoch. See also how Genuine messes up the young man's hair in a rush of passion -- shades of John Barrymore's transition scenes from DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE?", "Regardless of this silent-era picture now being almost 100 years old, it's still not worth more than a 2-star rating, in my books.Believe me, this German export was pretty bloody awful (even when I took into account it being a product of cinema's by-gone days).For one thing - Had the leading actress, Fern Andra (who played the title character, Genuine) been even marginally attractive, then, yes, that would've certainly helped this nonsensical film at least rise above its sub-par mediocrity.But this actress (with her frizzy hair and bug eyes) had to be one of the absolute, most dog-ugly dames imaginable, regardless of the era of fashion that she represented.It's especially when you take into consideration that the Genuine character was supposed to be an irresistible seductress (aka. vamp-ire), where all the men were literally falling head-over-heels in love with her (and actually quite willing to commit murder, if she so commanded) that her decidedly cheap and somewhat creepy looks rendered her (along with the rest of the movie) as being repulsive rather than attractive.Besides not being even slightly entertaining (even from a nostalgic point of view), I found this moldie-oldie, with its ridiculously exaggerated acting, to be nothing but a stale, old joke told in very bad taste.Thank goodness this film only had a running time of just 43 minutes.", "I thought this movie was pretty enjoyable, the atmosphere was unique and cool, the cinematography was great, and the visuals were amazing but what it failed in was story, it didnt really have such a great story, the ending was so anti climactic and dissapointing, theres a lot good about it but theres lots of bad to it too, i thought it was alright though, 5.8/10.", "FYI, there is a longer 89 minute version with French intertitles. The story is allowed to develop much better, it's worth seeking out.", "Since watching 'Genuine' in its entirety is essentially impossible at this point, we are left with a 45-minute condensed version which is possibly the main issue with this film.Genuine, released in 1920, was director Robert Weine's immediate follow-up to the successful 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'. A film that successfully showcased Germany's rising expressionist movement. Genuine follows a similar set design to Cabinet, with sets consisting of contorted shapes and lines as well as colourful tinting.While is may be visually intriguing, this is really the only thing going for this film. Since almost exactly half of the footage is missing in the condensed version, the plot becomes quite difficult to follow, although the basic synopsis is simple - Genuine is essentially a succubus-type 'vampire' who seduces men in their dreams.Other than Genuine, the other characters are more or less completely forgettable unlike those in Caligari. This really could have been a great film, but the plot isn't all that strong (the cut footage doesn't help this) and the characters are forgettable. The visuals are interesting however - especially for fans of Caligari or German expressionist art.4/10"], "tt0011234": ["I add a review if a film has no yet received one. I recently saw this at the Gothique film society screening at the Cinema Museum in London, it should be noted the intertitles were live translated as they are in Italian (it's the only known print), this is my review...\nOddity, the first film to feature a human brain transplanted into a gorilla, however this is only a minor sub-plot, in the main it's a story of newspaper rivalry, with skulduggery afoot, and a junior reporter as hero. It's a plot that's way too narratively driven to work as a silent, there are endless intertitles to try and explain what's what, the only cinematic bit of the film is some crazy stunts near the end, which don't make sense from a story point of view. In it's favour, it's rare and there is a man in a monkey suit.I waited a bit before posting this, as I hoped someone would beat me to it with a more positive review."], "tt0011243": ["David Devant was one of the three great music-hall illusionists of Victorian England. His near-contemporaries Nevil Maskelyne and George A. Cooke specialised in large-scale effects that took up an entire stage (usually the Egyptian Hall in London) and which could be viewed from the most distant seat in the gallery. Conversely, David Devant often worked in miniature: many of his magic tricks involved small props such as newspapers, balls, hats, rabbits and doves.Devant's career peaked during the 'spiritualism' craze, when self-described clairvoyant mediums made money with their alleged ability to summon the departed spirits of their gullible clients' dead loved ones. Devant used his experience as a conjuror to expose these frauds, often duplicating their effects with no supernatural help.'The Great London Mystery', a silent serial, is one of the very few chapter plays produced in Britain, although many American serials were exhibited in British cinemas. (I have my own fond memories of a tiny cinema in Victoria Station which, as recently as 1979, was still showing American serials from the 1930s: one chapter each week, in proper sequence, with a full programme of short subjects.) I was recently able to view an incomplete version of 'The Great London Mystery' which was discovered in Cornwall, near where this serial was originally filmed. One surviving reel, identified as \"Chapter 12\", has end titles which imply that this was the serial's final chapter.Devant stars as a character named 'the Master Magician', although it's established early on that he's a conjuror, an illusionist: he doesn't claim any supernatural abilities. Much like Mandrake the Magician in the American comic strip, this fellow uses his fake magical powers to stop real spies and criminals. Devant gets a chance to use his magic wand against a French femme fatale named Froggie the Vampire. (I well and truly LOVE that name!) Mam'selle Froggie is a vampire in the Kipling sense, not the Bram Stoker sense. In this role, a sloe-eyed and slow-motioned actress named Lola de Liane (who?) vamps until ready and slinks like a minx. The head villain in this serial is a downmarket Mister Wu knockoff named Ching Ling Fu, played by a white actor with sellotaped eyelids. Ching Ling Fu claims to be a master of Oriental magic, but all of his sorcery is fake ... and easily exposed by Devant.The only genuine touch of supernaturalism here (at least in the incomplete chapters which I screened) is supplied by the victim of one of Ching Ling Fu's surgical experiments: a man with monkey glands, who has naturally acquired some simian characteristics. Lester Gard (who he?) overacts horribly in this role, although his makeup is interesting. Have a banana!I had difficulty following the plot, as the reels which I screened were non-consecutive. The three villains (he, she and it) pool their talents to rob and debauche Lady Doris Stapleton, whose hairstyle leaves much to be desired. As in many serials, the plotline is extremely episodic, without a continuing story arc. In several cases, I couldn't verify the proper order of the reels which I screened ... but it didn't seem to much matter. Most of the set-pieces in this movie are concerned with fake seances or some other 'supernatural' event which invariably turns out to be fraudulent: the script was clearly written to play to Devant's strengths and his personal crotchets.This movie has a dodgy sense of England's geography. Lady Doris seems to live in the Home Provinces, judging from how quickly the Master Magician travels back and forth between her manor and his headquarters in a theatre in London's West End ... but the exteriors in this film were clearly shot in Cornwall. There are exquisite exterior sequences, showing the beautiful Cornish countryside as it was in the days of George V's reign. There are several extended shots of beautiful craggy hills and rolling valleys, and I think I even glimpsed a chough (a native Cornish bird) winging across the screen during one sequence. The scenes which take place in London are much less convincing: mostly some interior sequences which could have been filmed anywhere, and some very brief stock footage of the Angel of Christian Charity (in Piccadilly Circus) and Shaftesbury Avenue. I'll rate 'The Great London Mystery' 4 points out of 10, mostly for its historical value."], "tt0011295": [], "tt0011311": [], "tt0011318": [], "tt0011348": [], "tt0011417": [], "tt0011565": ["Lon Chaney (as Blizzard) is the underworld lord and master of San Francisco, despite a striking disability - he has no legs. Mr. Chaney's \"Blizzard\" was, as a boy, a \"victim of San Francisco traffic\", and had his legs amputated above the knees, after an accident. Moreover, the amputations were unnecessary; they were needlessly preformed by young, inexperienced Charles Clary (as Dr. Ferris); Mr. Clary also leaves a brain contusion untreated. As a boy, Chaney hears an older, experienced doctor scold Mr. Clary on the unnecessary procedure; but, they cover up the crime, and dismiss the young amputee's protests as delusions, caused by ether.Twenty-seven years later, the powerful crime lord decides to enact his terrifying revenge on the doctor who cut off his legs. Cheney answers a newspaper ad posted by Clary's daughter Claire Adams (as Barbara Ferris); she is a sculptress, looking for someone to model Satan, for her bust:\"WANTED -- Model to pose for statue of 'Satan After the Fall.' If you think you look like Satan, apply at studio of Barbara Ferris, 32 Institute Place. 8284\"The Satanic-looking Chaney is the perfect candidate to sit for the young woman; and, Ms. Adams welcomes him into her art studio, unaware (yet) of his unfortunate association with her father.

He is especially interested in why Chaney has his \"show girls\" making thousands of hats\"The Penalty\" has a noticeable degree of implausibility, as do many films; and, it does become make the film more than a little distracting, at times. Yet, Chaney's performance is so commanding, and so thoroughly enjoyable, it's really pointless to list faults. The film works on the strength of Lon Chaney's performance. Director Wallace Worsley, photographer Donovan D. Short, and art director Gilbert White contribute to the master, by giving the film a great, atmospheric look.Among the supporting players, James Mason (as Frisco Pete) is easily the standout. Young Edouard Trebaol (as Bubbles) is also well-employed, and natural, alongside the high degree of emoting present amongst the adults. Trebaol memorably re-teamed with Chaney in \"Oliver Twist\" (they were \"Fagin\" and \"The Artful Dodger\"). Interestingly, in the original Gouveneur Morris novel, \"Bubbles\" had an expanded role, which eventually revealed him to be the son of \"Blizzard\". That subplot would have added greatly to this film, further contrasting cruelty and humanity; and, of course, recalling the boy \"Blizzard\", and his earlier loss. It would have also confirmed the adult Chaney's obvious sexual prowess (note how women kneel down to play Chaney's pedals has he tickles the ivories).Whatever its faults, \"The Penalty\" set the standard for the expertly performed and extremely successful Lon Chaney role - grotesque, anguished, sympathetic, and/or deformed. It started here. Give yourself a penalty if you pass up this Chaney classic.********** The Penalty (11/15/20) Wallace Worsley ~ Lon Chaney, Ethel Grey Terry, Claire Adams, Jim Mason", "Combining a creative, atmospheric story with a fine performance by Lon Chaney makes \"The Penalty\" an effective and memorable suspense classic.  In one of his earliest leading roles, Chaney is a complete success, both in defining an unusual character and in bringing out everything inside the mind of the sinister \"Blizzard\".  You can already see his determination to make his character visually convincing and flawless, even at the cost of great discomfort.  Chaney also shows, as he would so many times, his rare skill in using facial expressions and gestures to show just the right amount of emotion and intensity.The story is quite interesting in itself, and though it slightly stretches plausibility at times, it is by no means predictable.  The brief opening scene of the childhood accident efficiently sets up the background for the strange world dominated by Chaney's vengeful character when he becomes an adult.  From there, the well-crafted story keeps you interested and keeps you guessing.  The settings are well-chosen, creating an interesting and appropriate atmosphere, with Blizzard's strange hideout and the sculptress's cluttered studio both standing in contrast with the respectable-looking Dr. Ferris and the other characters.A mere account of the events in the story would not convey the success of the movie in creating a distinctive world in which the characters come to life.  This is also a case in which a silent film is probably more effective than a sound film would have been.  One of the main flaws in many movies of this type is the vapid dialogue that dissipates the tension through unintentional humor.  Here, the title cards need only convey some basic ideas - the rest of it is handled without sound by Chaney, by the rest of the cast, and by the production crew who put everything together so well.", "A master criminal pays THE PENALTY for a life full of evil.Lon Chaney became a major movie star with his role in this shocker. Already regarded as a fine actor for his performances in lesser films, he now proved he was quite willing to go far beyond mere makeup for the enhancement of his screen persona. His dedication to his craft, coupled with an outsized talent, were to make Chaney one of the foremost film actors of the 1920's.Here Chaney plays a legless mobster who plots terrible revenge upon the doctor who maimed him (his plan to sack San Francisco of its wealth is almost incidental.) In order to create the illusion of being a paraplegic, Chaney bound his legs back and encased them in stumps. He is able to hop about with great alacrity using crutches, but he suffered intense pain during the filming and could only abide the prosthetics for short periods of time.As remarkable as what he's able to achieve on his knees might be, it is the face of Chaney which is equally memorable here. The fact that he's able to model for a bust of Satan as part of the plot is no accident. His features take on the visage of pure unadulterated evil. The blood chills to look at him. Chaney the Actor has wordlessly spoken.The film itself is a pleasantly florid potboiler, with plenty of menace, mayhem and damsels in distress. But it is Chaney who lingers longest in memory's darkest recess...", "I first saw this as a kid.\nI had vague memories of this film.\nRevisited it recently on a dvd.\nThe plot - A surgeon mistakenly amputates both the legs of a young lad. The young lad overhears the conversation between the surgeon n his mentor about the negligence n the cover up.\nFast forward n this boy has turned into a monster known as Blizzard, the criminal mastermind who wants revenge but has a penchant for music.\nThe highlight - Lon Chaney gave a terrifying performance.\nThe astonishing physical get up of a man who had lost both of his legs just above the knee, the transformation by walking with the aid of two crutches, using his arms alone, his menacing grin n sorrowful face, all these were top notch.\nAnother good aspect is the direction by Wallace Worsley.\nHe managed to create a true villain outta Chaney, gave the film a gritty look and above all, the villain's lair - so innovative n secretive, much before all the bond n comic book villains.", "Wow,...there is so much that is wonderful about THE PENALTY, but there's so much of the ending that undoes all the wonderful stuff in the first 90% of the film. Let's first talk about the good stuff. Lon Chaney plays an absolutely amazing role as a double-amputee. He actually bound his legs behind him and learned to walk on stumps for the role and he really looks like he's missing legs! Unlike 'Lt. Dan' from FORREST GUMP, this was not a computer trick--instead, Chaney underwent this very painful ordeal to get the part right.His character is an evil mastermind and he looks so incredibly tough and nasty. Some of this is natural (he was a far from handsome man) but part of his appearing so menacing was due to makeup and wonderful acting. The plot also was pretty creepy and exciting in a very, very dark way. As the evil criminal mastermind, Chaney did some very scary and edgy things--such as using a trap-door to make his enemies fall into a pit where they were then quickly dispatched!! As a result, the film was very exciting and weird--in a good way.However, the most grisly aspect of the plot--where Chaney had an enemy's legs chopped off and grafted onto his own stumps--was NOT done but only threatened. In what I see as a 'cop out' to make the movie less disgusting and provide a happier ending, when the surgeon is forced to do this awful procedure, he instead finds a tumor on the base of Chaney's brain that apparently made him evil! And, 'VOILA'--when the tumor was removed, Chaney was apparently another Albert Schweitzer--with a new-found love of mankind! What a disappointing turn of events--especially for what comes next in the film.So in conclusion, the film is creepy, edgy and a marvelous performance by Chaney that is ultimately severely impaired by a poor ending. Too bad, but at least Chaney's later films would capitalize on the successful aspects of this early film and also produce better, more grisly and realistic endings--such as in THE UNKNOWN or PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.", "Morbid gothic revenge tale set in modern (1918) San Francisco. Chaney gives one of his best performances ever as Blizzard, a legless criminal mastermind out to get his back from the whole city of SF. He can only pillage the treasury, as he envisions, with legs, so he plots to have a doctor amputate another man's legs and graft them onto his own.Chaney is appropriately diabolical as he moves about on stumps and crutches faster than his bipedal friends. Phoney \"redemption\" through surgery climax does much to spoil the sadistic fun of the preceding seven reels.", "This was the first starring role for Lon Chaney, and he's terrific playing a double amputee whose legs were both needlessly cut off as a boy by a young doctor who felt it was required to save the child's life after a serious accident. The boy eventually grows up to be an embittered underworld leader, looking to settle the score. Chaney gives a great performance and he is still amazing to watch today, even 86 years later, while painfully contorting his body to produce the needed effect, utilizing only his talent and ingenuity in place of today's CGI effects. Sure, Hollywood would have used CG back then if they had the luxury, but I still find it more mesmerizing this way. Lon had to pull his legs up behind his back and have them strapped tightly underneath a long overcoat, hobbling about on his knees. The direction is solid and the story is consistently interesting and multi-layered. It's very easy to sympathize with Chaney's character through his strong performance, but I felt that the way his criminal behavior was explained for the conclusion was a tad of a letdown. Still, quite a worthwhile film. *** out of ****", "Imagine what self confidence (or maybe lack thereof) that one must have to answer an ad that states 'If you think you look like Satan, apply at studio of ...'. It wouldn't have been a problem for the 'Man of a Thousand Faces', the elder Lon Chaney who made the transition from vaudeville to silent films, and eventually into talkies. Chaney's films may be a little hard to come by, but they're worth catching if only to see the amount of dedication the actor put into his craft. That's demonstrated here by the painful looking exercise the man had to go through to appear amputated at the knee of both legs. You know, I kept marveling at how real the effect looked and wondering how the film makers did it, because it does look like the actor really has no legs. Other reviewers on this board describe the process, so one could check those out.The story itself is a rather ghastly one, as it follows the tragic amputation of a young boy's legs due to an accident, but which probably didn't have to be performed as suggested by a senior doctor examining the work of Dr. Ferris (Charles Clary). The operation affects the young man not only the physically, but mentally, as he resorts to a life of crime that transforms into a madness for corruption and power. Taking the name of Blizzard (Chaney), the evil madman concocts a bizarre plan of revenge on the doctor who operated on him, the doctor's daughter, and even the entire city of San Francisco.I have to admit, there were any number of disconnects in the story for me which one might attribute to the writing of the era. One of the major ones involved Blizzard's management of a workshop in which dance hall girls assembled thousands of hats! Later it was revealed that the plot to loot San Francisco involved ten thousand disgruntled foreign laborers, but even so, why the business with the hats? It all seemed rather bizarre, but no more so than the twist at the end of the story that restored Blizzard's brain to normalcy, even as he wound up paying the penalty for his formerly wicked life.I caught this film on the Turner Classic Movie channel, with a soundtrack that eerily fit the activity that appeared on screen. I doubt if it was the original score for the film if indeed there was any. The music offered was at times strange, mysterious, and other-worldly, expertly complementing the character of Blizzard and his garish life. One might even consider the version of the soundtrack I experienced to be somewhat devilish.", "A deformed criminal mastermind (Lon Chaney) plans to loot the city of San Francisco as well as revenge himself on the doctor who mistakenly amputated his legs.\"The Penalty\" was one of Chaney's breakout roles, showcasing his taste for the macabre and talent for contortion and disguise. He had previously demonstrated similar qualities in the previous year's \"The Miracle Man\", but \"The Penalty\" and \"Treasure Island\" secured Chaney's place as one of the greatest character actors, before moving on to his more famous roles in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\".This story is great, the acting is fine and the directing is good, too. But really, the draw of this film is Chaney -- a man who was willing to undergo extreme and permanent bodily pain in order to make his role as believable as possible. I am not entirely sure why an amputee was not hired, but if it launched Chaney to the big time, I am glad it worked out the way it did.", "This was Lon Chaney's first starring film after wowing everyone in \"The Miracle Man\".I watched \"The Penalty\" at night and it really scared me. Even though people are dismissive of the ending - that it is too \"comfortable\" - I needed that ending - I would have found it difficult to get to sleep otherwise.Lon Chaney plays Blizzard, the insane crime lord of the San Francisco underworld. As a child he was the victim of a botched operation which left him a double amputee. He overhears the doctors talking about how the operation was unnecessary and grows up bitter and twisted in his mind.Chaney's performance is outstanding - he endured great pain by strap- ping his legs up at the knees in a specially made harness. Not only that but he perfected the walk until he actually walked like he had always been an amputee. Jumping onto tables, climbing up ladders, sliding down poles - all landing on his knees!!!He runs a millinery where he terrorizes the factory girls by jumping on the table and grabbing their hair. If one happens to catch his fancy - she becomes his personal slave - and is forced to use her hands as pedals when he plays the piano as he has no legs!!!He is surrounded by an evil henchman - Frisco Pete - who will stop at nothing to keep in Blizzard's good books - even to killing one of the girls, Barbary Nell who has left the factory to make out on her own.Litchenstein head of the secret police wants one of his agents, Rose (Ethel Grey Terry) to go undercover to get evidence to destroy Blizzard. Blizzard has a plan to take over the city and seek revenge on the doctor that operated on him as a boy.The doctor, now a famous surgeon, has a daughter who is a sculptor but wants to do a worthwhile piece of art before she marries. She places an advertisement in the paper for models that look like Satan. Blizzard is hired!!!!Meanwhile Rose has been working undercover and found nothing. When Blizzard is out she finds an underground passage - complete with an operating theatre. He plans to form an army of disgruntled foreigners who will loot the city. Blizzard, by this time will have had an operation on his legs to make him able bodied and the legs he is looking at belong to Wilmot, the doctor's assistant. There is an operation but not the one he demands!!!Lon Chaney's facial expressions are really remarkable - in a lot of scenes he really looks satanic.There are no known names in the cast - Kenneth Harlan, who had a reasonable career and at one time was married to Marie Prevost, plays Wilmot. Cesare Gravina, who had a part in \"Greed\" as the junkman, has a small part in this film playing a sculpting instructor.This is a fantastic film - I will give it 10 out of 10.", "The Man of a Thousand Faces in 1920, before his prime, under the direction of Wallace Worsley who would make him the Hunchback. But instead of being the sympathetic and heart-warming freak, here he is a demoniacal madman out for revenge.\"The Penalty\" follows Blizzard, an underworld mastermind who had his legs unnecessarily amputated as a child (kinda like Reagan in \"Kings Row\"). And aside from general evil, crime, and mayhem, his main goal is to claim revenge on the doctor who did it. After we see the grisly mangling, we move to modern-day (1920) San Francisco where Frisco Pete, a drugged-out hoodlum, murders showgirl Barbary Nell and then flees to sanctuary at Blizzard's hide-out. The police send Rose, their undercover girl, to disguise herself as one of Blizzard's many molls, and become practically a concubine who presses the pedals as Blizzard plays the piano. Meanwhile, he works to seduce the sculptress daughter of the doctor who deformed him, posing as Satan for a sculpture. And all the while he's planning for the greatest crime spree of them all, when he'll bring thousands of disgruntled foreign laborers in to conquer the city...God, \"The Penalty\" is creepy. It might not be the best-made movie of all time; the actors might not all stand out; the ending may be a cop-out. But it's got a lot of good points going for it. First, the title. \"The Penalty\" is about penalties of all kinds: Dr. Ferris must pay a penalty for his youthful indiscretions; Blizzard must pay a penalty for his life of crime. San Francisco must pay for creating monsters like Blizzard and Frisco Pete. The film is submerged in an idea of guilt, revenge, and comeuppance. Lon Chaney, as always, is an asset, in building a disturbing atmosphere of fear and loathing, as well as messing with the viewer's psyche through his performance. On turns you pity and hate him. Sure, he's evil. But his evil is so hypnotically attractive. And he's not entirely to blame for it. He's got no legs- can he still be fully responsible for his actions? Whatever Blizzard does, he revels in it. Climbing up the wall, with those stumps- can you take it? Like other quasi-horror films of the '20s and '30s, \"The Penalty\" is rife with hellish, gargoylian imagery. Beyond the buckets on Chaney's stumps and his legless swagger, there's the satanic sculpture and the apocalyptic fantasies (in which we see SF reduced to anarchic rubble) and the secret room full of chorus girls making hats, and the dirty underground corridors hidden behind Blizzard's fireplace, and the fully equipped operating room (in which he sets his bizarre revenge, which is worthy of Tod Browning). Then, looking at \"The Penalty\" from our postmodern perch, we can also enjoy the tinting (which changes from scene to scene) which gives it an almost psychedelic flavor, especially when combined with the soundtrack, which is a mixed bag. It's got some organ, some indistinguishable wailing, a couple possible leitmotifs, and what could be music from the darker levels of Super Mario Bros. It all comes together to give us, basically, \"The Phantom of the Opera\" meets \"Citizen Kane\" in hell, dimmed a few notches.What can I say? If you like Lon Chaney, you're bound to love his role here. The finale may be a let-down, but those are the breaks. Watch with plenty of suspended disbelief and immerse yourself in the abstractly gritty, mildly Gothic San Francisco gangland of the 1920s.", "I do love silent films and while this isn't a horror film, though I believe Lon Chaney is probably known best today(if at all) by younger viewers for his horror film work, it still a creeper. Lon plays Mr. Blizzard, a crime kingpin who had his legs amputated at the knee when he was a child. They were mistakenly amputated by a young doctor who later made a great name for himself in the field of medicine and all the while, Blizzard, in his crippled, broken body planned a very great revenge against not only the doctor who disfigured him, but against the entire town of San Francisco. His view was that cripples like him were shunned by society, so the best place for him to be was in the criminal underworld. He rose to a place of distinction(though one wonders how since even though he is intimidating, most street hoods wouldn't have been scared of him) and his villainous tendrils stretched out into many pockets and back alley shenanigans. I enjoyed the dialogue and Chaney's facial expressions are a true marvel. No one can look like him anymore. And, more to the point, he truly suffered for this role. To be realistic, and without the aid of the all too taken-for-granted CGI, Lon rigged up a special harness to bind his legs so he could walk on his knees with his lower legs tucked up behind him, under his coat. Not only does it look like a painful device, Chaney himself commented on its torturous design. There was a single dreamlike sequence towards the end of the film where you see him with his \"new\" legs, but that scene was eventually cut, and I feel rightly so. As a side, I loved the second doorknob that was placed at kid-level just for him. My only complaint about the film was the occasional use of an inappropriate score, though at times spot-on, other times it was very ineffective and even distracting. Obviously, this is a modern score and not the original music.Highly recommended for Chaney fans or just silent film buffs in general.", "The wrongful amputation of a child's legs due to a doctor's misdiagnosis leads to the embittered rage of the patient as an adult. The coping with not having legs, often repulsing others and pretty much ruining the relationship with his father, Blizzard(Lon Chaney in a mesmerizing performance)has risen to the ranks of Master of the Underworld in San Francisco. He's a cruel, sadistic tyrant who rules his district(The Barbary Coast)with such an iron fist that even police rather fear him. He has dreamed for years of having new legs grafted, following the success in the surgical field of Dr. Ferris(Charles Clary)with a demented goal of revenge if his desires aren't met. He's also planning to take over San Francisco as a Caesar(..he's really quite mad)with his dance-hall girls making hats so that he can start a revolt using supposed foreigners as his bait to draw out the authorities. Anyway, secret agent Rose(Ethel Grey Terry)is moved in to snuff out Blizzard's operation, but soon finds herself in love with him. Blizzard also has plotted a scheme to get back at Ferris by moving in on his daughter..Blizzard sits in as a model for daughter Barbara(Doris Pawn)whose creating a sculpture of Satan, while her fianc\u00e9 is enraged with jealousy and fear. For a good hour and fifteen minutes, Chaney etches the portrait of a man consumed with evil and displays this cunning shark playing a game with others as his face twists in snarls and sneaky grins. I don't buy the idea, though, that a contusion at the base of the skull, placing pressure on the brain, causes Blizzard to become the purely maniacal ringleader of crime he so becomes, but the film's roots is in tragedy and \"paying the piper\" so the filmmakers seemed determined to have him go out facing the music as a wholesome human being.", "Lon Chaney stars in one of the best performances ever caught on screen. Dedication is a trait we sometimes don't see in actors but when you saw the name Lon Chaney attached to a picture you knew he was going to give 110% to his role. The Penalty is at times very silly but it only becomes that way if you look hard enough through Lon Chaney's mastery.Lon Chaney stars as Blizzard, a deranged amputee who is the head of San Francisco's crime underworld. He is a mad man and the author-ties are determined to bring him down, an inspector named Licthenstein sends his loyal assistant Rose to go undercover in Blizzard's world. Blizard is planning a crime that will leave San Francisco in ruin but he doesn't focus in on it. He has another part of his plan, he will play with the mind of Barbara an aspiring artist who is creating a sculpture of Satan. Through this he vents all his criminal energy toward capturing Barbara's fianc\u00e9, the future son in law of the doctor who mistakenly amputated his legs and force him to graft them on to him.Meanwhile Blizzard exacts his control over the two women in his life, Rose and Barbabra the doctor's daughter. They are both morbidly fascinated by him and both begin to fall in love with him.This story is overly melodramatic even for the silent era but I have to strongly recommend for Chaney. His performance is absolutely breathtaking. The fact that he so convincingly plays an amputee through great physical pain leaves you in awe. It puts you in so much awe that we forget the silly communist commentary and the fact that if this film did not have Chaney it probably would be another forgotten lost film.I think this film is an important part of motion picture history simply because it shows what separates a great actor from a legend", "If anyone has any doubts as to who is the greatest actor of all times, CHECK OUT THIS FLICK!!! No CG here to make legs disappear. Just One mans creativity and iron will. There is nobody in Hollywood (or anywhere else for that matter) who has the kind of mettle this guy had. Those who believe Lon only did Phantom and Hunchback type fare really need to see this. I have been a fan of Lon's work since seeing The Phantom at an early age. His makeup job nearly scarred me for life. My father had to explain to me that it was only makeup, show me a picture of what he really looked like (a picture of a middle aged, jowly, smiling man,) and tell me the tale of \"the Man of a Thousand Faces.\" This hooked me. Lon delivers in this role. His animated face goes through all gears with liquid rapidity. The new \"industrial\" flavored soundtrack definitely adds something, too. Kudos to Kino for that. If you like Lon Chaney, you will love this movie. If you have never seen any of his work, this is a great place to start.", "If not the very first to reach a wide audience, Wallace Worsley's The Penalty survives to this day certainly at least as one of the more memorable and enjoyable proto-noir gangster thrillers from the mid-to- late silent era. Featuring engrossingly dark imagery throughout, a wonderfully gritty plot line filled with characters blooming from a pre-code era and a sense of pace in editing and direction so brisk you might have to look twice at its production date; The Penalty has plenty going for it but by far its best feature lies in the magnetic and grotesquely alluring performance of its lead star Lon \"the man of one-thousand faces\" Chaney.Committing fully to his role as a man wrongly crippled at a young age by inept Dr. Ferris in the late 1890s, Chaney is so convincing in his role that viewers unfamiliar with his more famous works could be forgiven for Googling his name to find out if he really did have legs or not. Apparently the apparatus he wore to achieve the effect (which he had to insist on wearing against the studio's reported resistance) left him with lasting back problems for the remainder of his life. Whether true or not, the result is nevertheless a marvel to watch as his character of Blizzard\u2014a brilliantly creative, megalomaniac-kingpin of sorts\u2014hobbles his way in and out of people's lives, playing their strings all the while grinning sardonically with facial contortions likely to strip paint off walls.When Blizzard begins to enact on a long-dreamt-of plan of retribution against the now-successful Ferris however, it's the inclusion of the doctor's daughter Barbara that allows the audience to see briefly the sadness and morose qualities underneath the surface of the crime- lord's chagrined demeanour. Chaney nails both sides of the coin equally well, despite the film's best and most enjoyable moments resulting from Blizzard's more-often-than-not irritable and ill- tempered outbursts. Then there are the moments where the character switches back and forth like a light switch. During an early scene, Blizzard, while playing a wonderfully sombre and melancholic classical piano piece, begins: \"I shall be the master of a city! And for my mangled years the city shall pay me\u2014with the pleasures of a Nero and the power of a Caesar!\" The contrast here is palpable, and were it in the hands of a lesser talent, may have come off stilted or jarring for the wrong reasons.On the other hand, the picture is by no means without its flaws. It's sometimes a little too melodramatic for its own good, specifically during the last 10 or so minutes. Furthermore, some plot lines go nowhere interesting, and the overall wrap-up is misguided and rushed to the point where it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, even though it does boast the best line in the film. As a package however, I would recommend at least one viewing. Much like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde released a few months prior, the performance of its lead star is worth the time invested alone. Unlike said film however, The Penalty still has plenty else going for it outside of Chaney whether it's from the performances of the supporting cast or the brisk direction by Worsley cut with incisive, well-written and paced intertitles.If you do seek out the film, again I would recommend the newly restored blu-ray which has been respectfully scanned and cleaned up by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department and released by Kino. The disc also features a score composed by Rodney Sauer performed by the Mont Alto Orchestra which bounces off and compliments the film beautifully to the point where they actually bring piano melodies played by Blizzard alive as he muses over his plans to conquer San Francisco by force. It's a nice touch and much like Chaney strapping his legs behind his thighs, brings a level of commitment and dedication that gives an extra spark to already bright and highly enjoyable film.", "Silent screen legend Lon Chaney has a particularly enjoyable role which he plays to the hilt. His expressions and delivery are absolutely delicious; he looks like he is having a terrific time playing this demented antagonist. Experts believe that the pain he must have felt wearing a harness had an impact on his performance and added to his intensity. The other performers are fine but are simply blown off the screen by his flamboyant villainy.The story is a good one. Based on the novel by Gouverneur Morris and scripted by Charles Kenyon & Philip Lonergan, it tells of a man named \"Blizzard\" (Chaney), who as a child had had his legs unnecessarily amputated by incompetent doctor Ferris (Charles Clary). He grows up to be a crippled, embittered gangster in San Francisco who plots an insidious revenge, intending to get close to Ferris's sculptress daughter Barbara (Claire Adams). She's in a creative slump and has decided to make a portrait of \"Satan after the fall\", for which Blizzard means to model. While this is going on, an undercover operative named Rose (Ethel Grey Terry) has infiltrated his organization to get the goods on him.\"The Penalty\" is a very diverting melodrama that does have a deliberate pace, but there are many fine moments with Mr. Chaney. In addition to its serious moments, it has some humour as well. It's especially funny when Blizzard asks of his henchmen, \"Do I look like Satan?\" One of the best lines of dialogue occurs when Blizzard is told that he's mad, and he responds that it's the kind of madness that succeeds. And Blizzard does indeed often look sufficiently mad.As directed by Wallace Worsley, this does have some neat details, such as hidden passageways, always fun to see in films from this period. And the story leads to a rather unexpected and touching resolution that is extremely effective.Must viewing for Chaney fans.Eight out of 10.", "This was as good as it gets for Lon Chaney, Sr. While the tale itself suspect, his performance rises above. We have all heard the stories of how this man could put himself through agony for a role. This is a prime example. A boy has his legs unnecessarily amputated by an inexperienced doctor. As he grows, he goes over to the dark side and becomes pure evil. Chaney somehow tucked those legs into some prosthetics. It must have been extremely painful. His primary victims are women whom he subverts through his gangland like power. It's hard to be totally appalled at his actions because he certainly is a victim. But he has choices. As time goes along, there are those who are willing to befriend him and actually express love toward him. He had one of the most emotionally expressive faces to ever grace the screen. Unfortunately, the conclusion sort of dies on the vine.", "I saw this film on the big screen. From the beginning, one may get the impression that this could be one of the \"been there...seen this\" plots. Not true.  The storyline is full of twists and turns throughout.  Even the title has a twist at the end of the movie.  While watching the plot unfold, I thought that it referred to the penalty the doctor and his family had to pay for the operation performed on Blizzard as a boy (Lon Chaney's character), making him handicaped...not so!  Another twist is the female detective's turning from her investigation to admiration of Blizzard;  the twist in the operation procedure performed on Blizzard to restore his legs; and then, the final twist at the end of the movie.  Not what you would have expected...however, the final \"penalty\" is paid.To sum it up...great actor and great story.  Worth a repeat viewing. Rating: 9/10", "Lon Chaney gives yet another outstanding performance as a man living with his legs amputated at a young age by mistake.  He overhears the doctors first saying it was a mistake and then forging a pact to lie and say the surgery was essential.  Chaney grows up to be a bitter, malevolent leader of underground activities in San Francisco.  The role gives Chaney several opportunities to show his undeniable skill as an actor and human contortionist.  Doubling his legs up and walking on his knees, Chaney mesmerized me with his ability to change reality into fantasy.  He looks like a crippled man.  Chaney also again showed me his range as an actor that could create pathos through his facial expressions.  Never playing a one-dimensional part, Chaney is often brutal and cruel throughout much of the film, yet he enjoys music and art and always possesses a certain charm and affability.  A wonderful performance all around!  The other actors are very good and the direction is nice and tight.  The story is very strong with some melodramatic overtones to be sure.  There are some great scenes in this film like Chaney carrying on like a madman demanding the legs of a young doctor and, in particular, the scenes where he poses as Satan after the fall.  The film has a nice pace for a silent picture, and the title cards are extremely powerful and literate.", "\"Blizzard,\" a double amputee intent on revenge, ranks among the \"Man of a Thousand Faces's\" finest performances. Lon Chaney dominates \"The Penalty,\" a 1920 silent film directed by Wallace Worsley. Although nearly a century old, the film is no museum curiosity, but rather a remarkably contemporary movie and an engrossing drama. The print is in good condition, projected at the correct speed, beautifully tinted, and well scored.While laying in his hospital bed, a young boy overhears his doctors admit that the amputation of his legs had been a mistake. Rather than admit their error, the doctors conceal their guilt, and, when the boy tells his parents what he heard, the doctors claim he is hallucinating from the effects of ether. The boy matures into Lon Chaney as \"Blizzard,\" an underworld crime lord, who seeks to take revenge on the doctor, the doctor's daughter, and on the city of San Francisco. As part of his plan, Chaney manipulates his way into being the model for a statue of Satan, sculpted by the doctor's daughter. Meanwhile, the authorities have planted a mole among Blizzard's confidantes to uncover his plot. Although other members of the cast, such as Charles Clary, Doris Pawn, Claire Adams, and Kenneth Harlan are largely forgotten, their acting is naturalistic for the most part, and only a few overplayed flourishes of the \"grand style\" mar the film. Made well before the Production Code, the film has a flash of nudity and an implied sado-masochistic relationship between \"Blizzard\" and the woman who manually pushes the piano pedals, while he plays the keyboard.Fine sharp cinematography, an engrossing story, good performances, and a legendary star in a memorable role, \"The Penalty\" is a must see for silent film aficionados and Lon Chaney fans. For those unfamiliar with either silents or Chaney, the film is an excellent work in which to discover both.", "Lon Chaney was probably one of the greatest actors of the Silver Screen and I have never been disappointed in any of his movies.  The Man of a 1000 Faces truly was more deserving of a musical score better than the one given to \"The Penalty\".  It was so irritating, I had to turn off the sound in order to enjoy yet another of his great performances.  His supporting cast was also very good and the story/plot is fantastic.  It is because of Lon Chaney that I (and others!) have taken such an interest in the silents. Over the years I have enjoyed Valentino (\"The Eagle\" is VERY impressive), Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford and others, but Chaney leads the pack. A big BOO-HISS to whomever was responsible for the score, but again, a giant \"10\" to Chaney's performance!", "A car accident leaves a small boy in the care of a doctor who decides to amputate both of the boy's legs. The boy also has a contusion at the base of his skull--a plot point that will become very important towards the end of the movie.Much to the doctor's shock and dismay, one of his colleagues reveals that amputation wasn't necessary and the boy overhears how the doctor butchered him. Years later, the boy would grow up to become Blizzard, the King of the San Francisco underworld.Blizzard has plans--not only to rob the city blind, but to exact revenge on the doctor who robbed him of his legs.This was without doubt, the best Lon Chaney Sr. movie I have seen. No elaborate facial makeups, just the acting skills of a master silent screen star--and the no doubt arduous pains Chaney must have gone through to affect the double amputee look.This might also be one of the very few Chaney Sr. films I've seen where he gets a girl. Not the one he had his eyes on throughout the film, but a girl nonetheless and after an operation, it appears Chaney may get a very happy ending--that is until he must pay the Penalty.This might also be the best restoration I have seen of all of Chaney's surviving silents. There's still one or two I have not purchased yet, but there was not a whole lot in the way of grain or dirt, static, whatever else may effect old movies such as these.Overall, if you're a fan of Lon Chaney, then \"The Penalty\" is required viewing. 10 stars", "LON CHANEY hobbles around on crutches, his legs mere stumps through a young doctor's mistake in amputating both legs above the knee after an accident as a young boy.Chaney, the actor, must have endured a lot of pain from having to bind both legs in order to convincingly play the double amputee--and, of course, he does it with so many flourishes using his crutches and nimbly mounting chairs and climbing using just the strength in his arms. There's strength in his face too, and it's used to advantage here when he poses for a bust of Satan, the Evil One. He can convey evil with just a slight change of expression and a look in his eyes, so much so that he's quite chilling in several scenes with very little make-up needed.The plot seems like a contrivance--an old-fashioned one about a man seeking revenge for the man that wronged him, but the plot throws in a couple of twists along the way so that in the end, \"the penalty\" is not the one you expected.I watched this on TCM and the only unfortunate thing was the irritatingly busy background score which became repetitive and inappropriate for the on screen action. Let's hope that someone else will compose a better score for this film, for it truly deserves better than the one provided so far.", "The more reviews I put out, the more movies I inevitably come across that are simply hard to comment on, and one such movie is The Penalty. Over a century old at this point, this film is one of around 50 surviving films that Lon Chaney acted in. Way before computers brought dazzling special effects to the screen, Chaney was busy horrifying audiences by turning himself into all kinds of outcasts and grotesque beings. This look at the movie will probably be short because there's not much to say. It is about Chaney playing a man named Blizzard whose legs were amputated as a child by the father of a girl he likes. The operation was not necessary, and Chaney is mad at the world because he can't live or walk normally anymore. Chaney is the leader of a criminal gang that he wants to make strong enough to raise hell on the streets of San Francisco. Blizzard later tries to force the girl to marry him but because he has no legs, you can probably guess what her response is. Blizzard also wants to cut off a certain other person's legs and fuse them onto his. After this, Chaney does actually marry the girl but a member of his gang kills him to prevent Blizzard from telling his new wife about the gang's existence. This movie is about as happy as a hanging, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. It's Chaney's dark and macabre personality at its best. There's a lot of morbid things in this movie (mainly because the main character has no legs) and I read somewhere that Chaney had to fold his legs behind his back and put his knees in buckets for hours on end to accomplish his character's appearance. It really shows how dedicated he was to make this movie. This film also features one of the coolest secret hideouts I've seen in a while. In the movie, Chaney has some kind of underground lair where he plans his gang activity, and its entrance consists of a long, vertical opening, kind of like an elevator shaft, that has two chains hanging from it. In the movie, Chaney presses a hidden button and the fireplace opens to reveal this vertical opening, and he clambers down using the chains. The Penalty is another great production starring one of the classic actors of horror."], "tt0011607": ["The Parson's Widow is not entirely a really great silent film; it loses some of its strengths as a satire on marriage and (partially) religion when it starts to get a little sentimental towards the end. But for a while, one sees a film by the master Danish filmmaker Carl Th. Dreyer flexing his directorial muscles on something that is something one might not expect from seeing such pieces of perfect tragedy like Joan of Arc or Day of Wrath. Here we get the story of Sofren (Einar Rod), an unconventional would-be Parson who 'auditions' for the position by going on about the devil in an off-beat manner (yes, off-beat). He learns that in order to become the village Parson, he needs to marry the presumed local old witch, Miss Pedersdotter (grim-faced Hildur Carlberg), who lures him in with a piece of cursed cod and has him succumb to marry her - but he really wants Mari (Almroth), and cannot until she dies. But when?There's some splendid comic set-pieces set in here, like with Sofren trying to scare the old Miss in a devil-disguised sheet, only to be foiled by his own slippers, or when Sofren tries to sneak out at night to see Mari and continually gets caught (or, in one case, another old woman in the bed!) But what's more amazing here is Dreyer's choices in casting. Rod is perfect for this kind of frustrated, ambitious but conniving sort, with great and imaginative eyes that do a lot while seeming to do little (one compared this as Dreyer doing Day of Wrath as a Chaplin, but I don't see much of Chaplin in his main male lead), and Carlberg is so dead-on for this old widow who may or may die (depending on if a life-lengthening potion works) that it's among some of Dreyer's best actors in one of his movies.While Dreyer sometimes loses his footing in the story, as mentioned towards the end, he makes up for it with some curious scenes, like the dance at the wedding, or the specific use of colored tints. When Sofron has the weird dream state of seeing a 'young' Miss Pedersdotter, we see it in a haze of light red (or maybe blue), and it's completely dazzling for a moment. It might be a slightly lighter affair than his more 'serious' pictures, but for the curious digging into Dreyer's catalog, it's not at all a disappointment. At its best Parson's Widow has a good, hard farcical grip on the subject matter.", "Pr\u00e4st\u00e4nkan (literal translation of title: The Parson's Widow).The Parson's Widow is significant for two reasons\u0096 It is one of the very few national romantic films, and it's one of the very first films to make extensive use of locations.National romanticism was a 19th century movement that glorified pure hearted, independent farmers (as opposed to the aristocrats) and looked to the hinterlands as a source of pure culture and moral inspiration. It was particularly influential in Norway, the film's location.As The Parson's Widow begins, S\u00f8fren, a divinity student, is offered a position in a rural parish\u00ac\u0096 provided he marries the parson's elderly widow. He accepts, despite his betrothal to Mari, whom he passes off as his sister. This theme could exist only in a land where poverty and hunger were facts of life.Modern audiences may find The Parson's Widow overly moralistic and sentimental. It has a 19th century feel\u0096 owing more to romantics like Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson than to more modern novelists like Knut Hamsun, who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1920, the year the film was made. At that point, national romanticism was on its way out.The story has a few supernatural overtones, but this is no horror film. In The Parson's Widow, the fantastic elements originate from folk beliefs and function primarily as cultural references.Set in an indefinite past, The Parson's Widow makes extensive use of locations at a time when few filmmakers ventured beyond studio doors. It idealizes rural life in a way that anticipates Robert Flaherty's Man of Aran. And, like Flaherty's film, The Parson's Widow meticulously recreates practices that were rapidly disappearing.The opening scenes were shot at Garmo stavkirke (stave church) in Maihaugen\u0096 the open air museum in Lillehammer, Norway. The farmstead scenes are probably shot at the same place, and the older extras would have been the last generation to learn the crafts they demonstrate as part of daily life.People today will view The Parson's Widow primarily because it is an early film of director Carl Theodore Dreyer. But this is no beginner's work. Beautiful composition, expressive lighting, and obsessive attention to detail are signature marks of the director who gave us The Passion of Joan of Arc and Vampyr. The Parson's Widow stands as a minor masterpiece in its own right, but the romanticism is unlikely to resonate with today's audiences.", "Hildur Carlberg, the skilled septuagenarian actress who plays Dame Margarete, died in August, 1920, two months before this film opened-- a heartbreaking irony, in part because the plot involves her youthful husband marrying her only to await her death.The film has marvelous comic moments, capitalizing on the fact that medieval European peasants suffered from backbreaking work, a total absence of education, and a desperate need for dentists. The scene when a couple of clerics (the losers) compete for the job of parson by delivering sermons in which they inadvertently skewer their own backwardness is priceless, especially as they are speaking to a congregation of bedraggled and toothless locals who were mostly in church to nap. And the scene where an old lady hocks something out of her nose before returning to her needlepoint-- fabulous.Dreyer, a committed naturalist who didn't even approve of make-up on his performers, shot this film on location at Maihaugen, Norway, in an open-air museum of 200 medieval buildings. Even the interiors are authentic. Every frame shows it. Watch particularly for a folk wall hanging in Dame Margarete's home. This is another silent gem from the director of The Passion of Joan of Arc.", "I haven't seen Carl Theodor Dreyer's directorial d\u00e9but, \"The President\" (Pr\u00e6sidenten), yet. I've seen \"Leaves from Satan's Book\" (Blade af Satans Bog), however, and it was totally unimpressive. Dreyer took from Griffith's \"Intolerance\", but didn't even manage a simulacrum of the American director's craft. \"The Parson's Widow\" is a much better beginning for Denmark's great filmmaker. It is the work of a director coming into his own, even though it's much different in some ways from the rest of his oeuvre.As with \"Leaves from Satan's Book\" and his later films, there's the preoccupation with history and religion. But, as others agree, this is Dreyer light. The story of a man who must marry a hag to become a village's parson, and his plots to marry his young fianc\u00e9e and keep the job despite it is amusing. I thought the devil costume bit was particularly humorous. Dreyer's direction is what makes this worthwhile, though. The quick pace, not lingering on shots and improved camera positioning compared to \"Leaves from Satan's Book\" make this film more accessible and entertaining.Dreyer again uses masking and fades extensively, but this time it adds to the style. He gets the most out of the actors. (It shouldn't be underestimated how quicker shot succession can improve, or detract from, otherwise unremarkable acting.) Additionally, the introduction to the past through the waterfall was an especially nice touch. The confining location sets, and more importantly, how Dreyer and cinematographer George Schn\u00e9evoigt film them also add greatly to this tightly told film. The small church full of dividers is just a great find, and they use the spaces of the home of the parson's wife very well, with camera placement and continuity editing.", "\"The Parson's Widow\" is one of the best silent films that I have ever seen. Its images, its pace, and its themes all blend together into one fine production from the young director Carl Theodor Dreyer.Since the plot of the film is well-covered by other reviewers, I will focus on other elements of the film. The photography of the film is rich and subtle, just what one would expect of the film's director. The opening scene of a waterfall is one of the many refreshing Norwegian country images that enliven this film. In some cases, the photography also reveals the characters' inner states of mind. The scene where the young minister gets drunk is photographed through a diffuser; the images look fuzzy and indistinct. This diffuser is removed and the image becomes clear again when the minister sobers up. Again, the photography of the film is quite clever and contributes greatly to experience of watching the \"The Parson's Widow\".The period flavor is also excellent. The film was produced in the historical village of Lillehammer, Norway. The film exudes the feeling of life in seventeenth century Europe. Churchgoers are herded into stall-like pews, and the elders are instructed to tap them on the shoulder with a stick when they fall asleep during the sermons. One can almost feel the environment where the drama plays itself out.Perhaps the only flaw in \"The Parson's Widow\" is its performances. The performances are pretty good, but the fast pace of the film (it is about seventy minutes long) makes it difficult for any of the performers to shine brightly. \"The Parson's Widow\" is definitely story-focused;little time is allowed for the actors and actresses to establish bits of business that might deepen their characterizations.All the same, \"The Parson's Widow\" is a small masterpiece and I recommend its viewing to all persons interested in the themes of love, death or religion. Enthusiasts of Carl Theodor Dreyer should be doubly pleased by this remarkable drama.", "The name Carl Theodor Dreyer may inspire images of slow pans, heavy religious/mystical themes, and somnolent pacing, but it was not always thus. During his apprenticeship at Nordisk in the early '20's Dreyer scripted, edited, and directed all kinds of films. \"The Parson's Widow\" anticipates themes in the mature Dreyer, namely religion and carnality, but cloaks them in an agreeable, fast-paced (for Dreyer!) silent comedy.A young parson wins a plum parish in 17th century Norway, but is obliged to marry the widow of his deceased predecessor and pretend his attractive young fiancee is his sister. Dreyer milks the situation for gags but goes for a sentimental finish a la Charlot. The master's touch is apparent in the close-ups of the pastor's would-be rivals and parishioners and a slow pan presaging the 360-degree views in \"Vampyr.\" Amazingly, HIldur Carlsburg in the title role closely resembles Maurice Schutz, the old chatelain in \"Vampyr,\" and the mother-in-law in \"Day of Wrath.\"All in all, a good film. But it is hard to believe that the director of this pleasant work could produce \"La Passion de Jeanne D'Arc\" just 6 years later.", "In Carl Theodor Dreyer's \"The Parson's Widow,\" we see a young man with his love in hand traveling to a small village in search for a preacher's position. Upon arrival, he finds he's one of three applicants. The other two put the congregation to sleep, but he speaks of hell and damnation. After learning he's hired, he's told the last parson's widow's hand is offered in marriage to the next parson. He is aghast at this! Then, he meets her. He being twenty something, she being much, much older, he is very wary and uneasy about this situation. He does go to her house and is mesmerized by the amount of food in front of him. He eats heartily and in his drunk, dazed, tired and woozy state of fullness, he sees (a vision of) her as a young lady and says he will marry her \u2013 but, when he comes to his senses later, he asks that \"his sister\" is given a job and quarters near him. (He and the widow do have separate rooms.) He tries to make night visits to his young love, but through obstacles never makes it. Will he eventually find love with the parson's widow, or will he and his young love find a way to happiness together? I've read that many of Dreyer's followers say that this is his best film, despite the fact this is not done in his usual solemn dramatic style. I have not seen all of his work, but I enjoyed this film very much. It was very heartwarming and had moments of feeling that are indescribable. Its combination of humor (with some characters) and depth (of others) creates a beautiful composition, or even a painting of far off. I know the music (exquisite!! \u2013 a variation of Grieg, the credits say) heard throughout probably has been redone, but I have never been so moved by the whole experience of a silent picture in a long time. This should be seen more often on TCM, so more people can discover this silent classic.", "I do not know if Dreyer's first feature, \"The President\" was a big hit, to speculate if he had strong doubts about what his next films would be. In any case, it did not take long before he started shooting again, for the next year he released \"Leaves Out of the Book of Satan\" and next \"The Parson's Widow\", a production made and financed in Sweden. The story tells how a young man, when selected as the new parson of a community, marries his predecessor's old widow (who claims her right to do so), but brings along his own fianc\u00e9e to live with them, making her pass as his sister. There is opportunism on both the parson's and the widow's sides, but this being a comedy these matters are treated lightly, as are eluded reflections on the options we may have in old age or youth, when facing the possibility of losing everything, as in the widow's case, or the shaping of a career and a happy life, in the young man's. Yet this is a strange comedy, for melancholy is always present, mainly reflected on the old but still beautiful and dignified face of actress Hildur Carlberg; and if it is true that Dreyer was not intent on making an ethnographic treatise, one of the most interesting aspects of his film is the portrait of rural settings, customs and rites, as religious sermons, feasts, weddings and funerals. If you ask me I prefer \"The President\" to this film, but it was a firm step in the filmography of the creator of \"The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc\", \"Vampyr\" and \"Ordet\".", "Over the mountain wander Sofren and Mari. Sofren is a student of theology come to apply for the vacant position of parson in this rural Norwegian village. Mari is his fianc\u00e9e, but not yet his wife because her father won't allow it until he becomes a real parson. Luckily for him, his two competitors from Copenhagen aren't particularly up to the task. The first looks like a cross between John Lennon and Bill Gates and bores his audience to sleep, so much so that even the man tasked with keeping everyone awake drops off; and the other is a bloated fool who keeps them amused only because Sofren has stuck a feather to the back of his head.So Sofren it is: the five bearded elders tasked with the decision don't have much of a task after all, given that he's young and dynamic and can think on his feet. However, there's a catch, for there must always be a catch. The local custom is that the parson's widow comes with the job. This wasn't for any religious reason, merely a practical one because someone has to take care of her, after all, but this particular parson's widow, Dame Margarete Pedersdotter, has outlasted the previous three parsons only to be handed over each time to their successors 'like a piece of furniture'.And just as Sofren had no problem outsmarting his rivals, who run for the hills the moment they see Dame Margarete anyway, the parson's widow outsmarts Sofren. Eager to retain her position running the parson's house, she persuades him subtly to propose. There's mention that she may be a witch but she really accomplishes it with a herring and a bottle of schnapps. So Sofren becomes the parson and Dame Margarete becomes the parson's wife once more, mistress of her whole domain. And with this setup, with Mari introduced into the mix as Sofren's sister rather than his fianc\u00e9e, naturally hilarity ensues.Well hilarity is a strong term, given that this is a Swedish silent film from 1920 and a Carl Theodor Dreyer movie to boot, but it's a lot closer to hilarity than I'd have ever imagined for one of his films. I've seen a lot of them, having been utterly stunned by The Passion of Joan of Arc and fascinated into finding as much of the rest of his work that I could. This was the second film Dreyer directed, but the eighth of his fourteen feature length movies for me. It's the first to invoke laughter, which comes about mostly in a subtle way but with some stooping to pantomime, such as the scenes where Sofren prances around in an elaborate Satan suit after he becomes convinced that his wife is a witch.It's constructed well, with strong performances and memorable characters, varied shots and varied expectations. It looks good, whether inside or out, and there's a lot of use of the common silent film masking technique that turns the screen into a small circle to highlight what we should be looking at. As would fit a story built around a folk custom, there's a great deal here that speaks to customs and folklore, from dances to rituals to beliefs. Quite which Scandinavian culture or cultures this applies to, I'm not sure, given that it's a Swedish film set in Norway but based on a Danish story, but they're fascinating.And backing up Dreyer's direction, Dreyer being a man who controlled his films as surely as Dame Margarete controls her household, are a number of memorable performances. Einar R\u00f6d plays Sofren as something of an imp. We rarely see him in church, this being one of the least religious religious films I've ever seen. Instead we watch him try all sorts of hare brained schemes to try to see his Mari, always coming up short but learning something in the process, there very much being a lesson here in and amidst the comedy. Greta Almroth is a wholesome but frustrated Mari, reminding a little of Elsa Lanchester.Best of all is Hildur Carlberg as Dame Margarete, dominant throughout but always human. Born as far back as 1843, she was 76 when she made this film, her third and last. With a memorable face with many lines showing her age and a memorable gait that would have made her a prime candidate for a major role in a zombie movie, it's sad that she wouldn't make any more. She died two months before this film was released. I wonder if they nailed a horseshoe above her door and sprinkled linseed oil on the ground to ensure she didn't come back to haunt her house.", "It took a while to latch on to this story because its characters aren't initially very likable. A young parson is willing to do anything to get a job, including marrying the past parson's widow. Since she is quite old, he figures she can't last long. He continues this charade, even moving his fianc\u00e9e into the house (pretending to be his sister). Meanwhile the widow, a homely woman who has had to endure this rule more than once, bides her time, lives her life, and has no pretensions of anything other than mutual living space. As time passes, she begins to grow on the young man. He sees her for the caring, loving person she is. There is not romantic involvement, only the saving of a soul and the reclamation of a charlatan. This is a simple film that has an excellent message.", "In some ways it's not hard to see that this is a film of Carl Theodor Dreyer. After all, religion is front and center in many of his pictures as well as his discussing the hypocrisy within it. But, on the other, the film is a comedy of sorts....and comedy and Dreyer are not usually associated with each other. Don't worry...the comedy is very dry and subdued so it still has the Dreyer touch...don't expect a Keystone comedy here!When the film begins, three young men out of seminary are being tested out to see which one will be the new minister in a small town. Sofren is thrilled when he is selected, as now he and his fianc\u00e9 will be able to get married...right? Well, no. The appointment has a bizarre clause...one so strange that the story never really made any sense. As a pre-condition, the young man was required to marry the old minister's wife. Odd...but even more ridiculous when she appears to be 4 or 5 decades older than the young man! Yet, he is ambitious and a bit scheming and so he marries her and plans on keeping his fianc\u00e9 on the side...telling his elderly bride that she is his sister.The bottom line is that apparently the Danes thought this sort of odd situation comedy was great stuff back in the day. Now, it just seems a bit, well, stupid. Well made...very well made...but stupid.", "Sofren and Mari, are two youngsters who wander into a typically idyllic Norwegian village. The village is searching desperately for a new parson and Sofren has studied hard for the ministry. He has been encouraged in this by his sweetheart Mari because her father will not allow her to marry Sofren until he becomes a real parson. There are two other applicants for the job of village parson but after a hard competition and delivering a splendid sermon, Sofren wins that Gott job. But there is a catch: according to parish law, Sofren must wed the late parson's widow, Dame Margarete; that's a terrible dilemma for Sofren since he cannot get Mari if he doesn't get the post and he will not get that unless he weds the old woman\"Pr\u00e4st\u00e4nkan\" ( The Parson's Widow , 1920 ) is an excellent and wonderful work in spite of the fact that it is only Herr Carl Theodor Dreyer's second film as a director but perhaps this is not a strange thing at all if we have in mind Herr Dreyer's great debut, \"Praesidenten\" (1919), reviewed by this German count in this modern diary sometime and liked by this Herr Von very much according to his aristocratic standards, nat\u00fcrlich!.Everything is remarkable in \"Pr\u00e4st\u00e4nkan\" ( astonishing art direction, again not unusual in Herr Dreyer's early works, in which every minor detail is matched carefully with wonderful outdoor scenery and technical effects that enrich superbly the film story ), but the most remarkable aspect of the film for this German count is Herr Dreyer's skill in filming a story with a religious subject but resisting the temptation to be sacrilegious or irreverent, the most obvious and easy ways for many directors to depict such a delicate subject. On the contrary, Herr Dreyer is very respectful of the religious theme of the story but includes also an intelligent sense of humour, Nordic humour nat\u00fcrlich!. The funny scenes fit perfectly in a story in which impatient and inexpert youngsters vie with a wise and crafty woman, and where all will learn their own lessons until finally common sense prevails.And that's a great Herr Dreyer film goal; to make a \"local\" story with its Northern customs into a universal film, overriding country barriers. That only happens when the author is a very skillful man, nat\u00fcrlich!.By the way, even though this German count speaks elegant languages such as Latin and ancient Greek, the first time that \"Pr\u00e4st\u00e4nkan\" was shown in the Schloss theatre, the nitrate had Swedish intertitles only, a dead language for this Herr Von. For that reason it is necessary to praise Herr David Shepard ( a singular longhaired youngster who cares about silent films ) for his superb English edition of this film so that illiterate youngsters around the world may also enjoy it.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must attend a dinner in which will be served parson's noses.", "Considering how rare a Carl Theodor Dreyer comedy is, it's something of a surprise to find how many laughs the Danish director of the stale Leaves from Satan's Book and gloomy Ordet gets out of the gentle humour to be found in this lightweight tale. Looking and behaving more like a 21st Century hipster than an 18th Century Man of God, Einar Rod plays a luckless young man who, upon securing a position as a village parson so that he may wed his fiance, discovers that a condition of the new job is that he must wed the former parson's widow. Much of the humour is mined from the way that his attempts to steal a few hours with his fianc\u00e9 are repeatedly foiled by his new old wife, played to perfection by Hildur Carlberg (who sadly died before the film's premier).", "Many surviving silent films hold up well, but while some are outstanding classics, not all are made equal. I'm pleased that 'The parson's widow' is an example of a title that remains fresh and engaging. True, just as much as revisiting such old movies is a bit of a trip through time, the focus here on a small Christian parish is perhaps a tad alien to modern viewers, to say nothing of the very notion of the bizarre custom underlying the premise. Yet that is the impetus for the plot, equal parts comedy and lighthearted drama, and with that the feature remains smart, playful, and worthwhile.The filming locations and set design and decoration are fetching, and I appreciate the costume design, and hair and makeup work. While some of the sequencing could stand to be more mindful, overall the editing is wonderfully sharp and adds to the viewing experience. Whether credit for that aspect is owed to filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer or his collaborators, or preservationists in more recent years, is a matter of some question, but either way it's well executed. Dreyer illustrates fine skills as director, and his cast capably realize their characters with suitable personality and nuanced range, with star Einar R\u00f6d especially standing out.'The parson's widow' is a great picture in general, though still more than anything else it's the writing that's most critical. There, too, Dreyer impresses, even as this is one of his earliest works as a filmmaker. Plentiful, pleasant situational humor characterizes the levity throughout - forefront at the start, then nicely balancing the more (relatively) serious drama as the length proceeds. Though never robustly funny, the comedy is consistently clever as protagonist S\u00f6fren, prospective fianc\u00e9e Mari, and title figure Margarete dance around an uncomfortable scenario and a slight sense of power dynamics. There's mild tension carried through these scenes as well, and the result is a feature that deftly bears a tone that's light, but not farcical, and dramatic, but not ponderous.I'm honestly rather delighted at just how excellent this is. Not all modern viewers can abide silent films, which I do understand, but this is so roundly enjoyable that I'd have to imagine even the most stubborn of hold-outs may find it appealing to at least some degree. Even in 2022 comedy-dramas sometimes have difficulty finding an even keel, but Dreyer achieved it here with an ease and gracefulness that's commendable. Rounded out with themes of love, patience, and linking generations together, 'The parson's widow' is an unexpectedly strong picture that continues to stand fantastically tall more than 100 years later. My recommendation can only be as earnest and heartfelt as this is - it's a lovely title that deserves more recognition and fond remembrance.", "Pr\u00e4st\u00e4nkan / The Parson's Widow (1920) :\nBrief Review -A pathbreaking romance with a lesson of goodwill easily makes into my top 5 films of Carl Theodor Dreyer. Having seen all the acclaimed works of Carl Theodor Dreyer, be it Danish or Swedish, I can easily say that The Parson's Widow makes it into my top 5 films (if not top 3) by the legendary director. All my top favourite Dreyer films belong to the talkie era: \"Vampyr\" (1932), \"Vredens Dag\" (1943) and \"Order\" (1955), except for his best work ever, \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928), which was a silent movie. Pr\u00e4st\u00e4nkan does not beat Joan's passionate story and Ordet, but finds equal praise as the other two films. The Parson's Widow is a weird romance. I think weird is an insulting word, so let me call it pathbreaking. Hal Ashby made \"Harold and Maude\" (1971) after 51 years, where a teenager falls in love with an old lady, and the latter dies in the end. Now imagine seeing the same stuff in a Swedish film made in 1920. A young graduate marries a lady of his grandmother's age to win the love of his girlfriend. How weirdly pathbreaking and fascinating idea it was! And the climax has a great deal of goodwill to leave you with a positive message and tender sentiments. The film is based on a story called Prestekonen by Kristofer Janson, and I don't know nothing about that. I just followed Dreyer's film adaptation and loved it. Einar R\u00f6d as S\u00f6fren is good, but seems over-expressive on many occasions. One such example was that feeling dizzy scene. But I liked his final quote, \"We owe her a great debt, Mari. She taught you to keep a good home and she taught me to be an honourable man.\" Any real man would love that. Hildur Carlberg as Dame Margarete is a show stealer here, while Greta Almroth poses cutely as an innocent girlfriend. Writer and director Carl Theodor Dreyer has done a fabulous job of making one of the most daring and beautiful love stories that stands the test of time, even today. His most significant achievement during his early career.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.", "This steadily won me over more and more as it went along. A light comedy with a surprising amount of pathos in the end, The Parson's Widow, Dreyer's second film, is a wonderful little find from the earliest days of cinema. There's a confidence to the filmmaking and subtlety to the performances that had been largely missing from The President, his first feature, that helps provide a strong emotional base on which the movie's final act requires in order to work.It's the story of a young parson, Sofren, fresh from the seminary with his fianc\u00e9e, Mari, in tow. He's walking his way to the remote Norwegian village where Sofren is applying to be their parson. He's up against two other recent seminarian graduates, both educated at more prestigious institutions. The opening around this contest between the three is the broadest comedy of the film, and it works least. It's amusing in its own way as we watch the first drone his audience to boredom and sleep while Sofren sabotages the second by placing a feather in his hair that turns him into a laughingstock. When the village elders decide on Sofren, they also outline a specific rule they have for their parsons. The new one must marry the widow of the previous. Margarete is very old and has been through this process three times before. She knows what she's doing, so when the other two applicants run off at the sight of her, Margarete takes Sofren back to his house, gets him drunk off of schnapps, and gets him to propose to her.Even sober it ends up making some sense to both Sofren and Mari. Margarete is old. She probably won't last too long, and since Mari's father won't let Sofren marry Mari until he has a situation, this is a necessary and temporary situation for them to endure until they can marry. Margarete is also an imperious old woman who puts Sofren under her thumb immediately, so they have to hide Mari by calling her Sofren's sister and bringing her into the household as a maid.So is the setup for the bulk of the film where Sofren tries desperately to find time with his fianc\u00e9e without either Margarete or her other two servants from finding out. Sofren grows more and more bitter as his efforts come to comedic frustrations that often lead him to accidentally sending amorous moves towards Margarete's older female servant. It even comes to the point where they decide to try and kill Margarete by frightening her to death. Sofren dresses up as a picture of the devil in a book, and it begins to work until she notices Sofren's slippers underneath the costume. Frightening him off, she immediately goes to his room in the middle of the night, letting Sofren suffer outside in the cold for hours until he decides to own up to it, costume head in hand, and confront his wife.Everything changes when Sofren decides to take things a little too far. Margarete goes up into a loft, and Sofren pulls the ladder away. Walking away, he doesn't realize that Mari is up there as well, and she falls down, breaking a leg and getting a concussion. Margarette becomes like a mother to Mari, comforting her as she convalesces, and this human side to Margarette convinces Sofren to simply tell her the truth. This decision to finally reveal what he wants softens Margarette. This tradition in the village isn't new, and her first husband of 30 years was also caught in the same situation where he had to marry the previous widow for five years before they could marry each other.All of the pathos of the ending is really built on the shoulders of the elderly actress Hildur Carlberg. Born in 1843, she was 75 years old when she made The Parson's Widow (dying a few months after filming), and she provides an amazing performance as Margarette. She is conniving early as she plots her succession, of a sorts, and once Mari gets injured, she convincingly turns into a worried mother, baring herself to the husband that she had wronged. It's very possible she understood the real situation between Mari and Sofren, choosing to secure her position jealously rather than allow two young people the love they shared, but when Mari gets injured, Margarette sees the error of her ways, the parallel to her own youth, and the humanity of her husband, and Carlberg sells it perfectly. It's a great silent performance.Outside of the movie's fairly rote first act (that's still entertaining enough on its own), there's something really wonderful going on from the moment Margarette is introduced. That it ends with such deep emotion is actually rather surprising, but welcomed and earned as well.This is a wonderful film, a second film that any director should be proud of. Confident and clear, The Parson's Widow is a very strong entry in Dreyer's filmography.", "Carl Theodor Dreyer ultimately became a director with a very personal style, comparable with Robert Bresson and Yasujiro Ozu. \"The parsons widow\" (1920) is however an early film made during a period when he was still influenced by Scandinavian directors like Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m.The story is about a man that will only get permission to marry his fiancee from the father of the girl when he gets a decent job. When he finds a job however tradition obliges him to marry the widow of his predecessor.Dame Margarete (the widow played by Hildur Carlberg) wears a peculiar kind of hat that made her look (to me at least) like a female Nosferatu (from the film of the same name by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau from 1922). The resemblance is only valid for the appearance however, because inside Dame Margarete is rather sympathetic. In essence \"The parsons widow\" is a film in which all main characters are nice. They are however held captive by some ruthless rules of tradition.Touching for me was the dead of Dame Margaret at the end of the film. No violent dead or agony caused by disease but a dignified farewell from a life she regarded as completed."], "tt0011654": ["An update to Arne Andersen's excellent comments (see below): a brief fragment of \"Satanas\" has been found.

From the beginning we're pulled in to this story by both its special effects and its storytelling. The scenes with the phantom carriage wheeling around, including one over the water to retrieve a drowned soldier, as well as those with a transparent Tore Svennberg and his ominous cloak and scythe, are fantastic. Director Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's use of flashbacks was ahead of its time, and he gradually reveals everything behind a young Salvation Army worker's request to see a man before she dies.Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m also plays that main character, and gives us a great performance in depravity. Among other things, he scorns help from charitable women in the Salvation Army by ripping up repairs to his jacket one spent all night mending, openly tries to pass along his disease (consumption) to others, and after tracking down his wife and small children, hacks down a door with an axe to get at them. It's pretty dark stuff. As he faces an avalanche of guilt over the consequences of his actions and his own impending fate, can he be redeemed? It's a weighty question that would later absorb Ingmar Bergman, who idolized Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, and the link between the two provides additional interest. Aside from the influence the film had on Bergman, 36 years later Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m would play the main character in 'Wild Strawberries'. It's also notable that 'The Phantom Carriage' was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorites from the silent era, and that he, too, was influenced when he put together Jack Nicholson's axe scene from 'The Shining'.As with many of the films from this time period, it drags in places to modern eyes, as interchanges between characters via intertitles and elongated facial expressions sometimes get a little tedious. It's also ultimately a morality tale, which may put some viewers off \u2013 and yet, I found the devotion and faith of the Salvation Army sister, as well as the prayer to 'mature one's soul' before dying to be uplifting. We see the dual nature of man in the film, good and evil, and it's put into the larger context of our mortality. It's fantastical, and yet we realize that someday death will come for us all, and whether we believe in an afterlife or not, we hope that we've done good things for others in the world. Well worth watching.", "\u0084Lord, let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped\u0085\"\"Strange...unusual...\"someone may think...to begin a review on this film with a prayer, more to say, a prayer not to achieve wisdom or intellect but...maturity - something that has hardly been a theme of many top notch productions - something hardly even mentioned as a human merit in the commercial world - yet, something at the core of this film's message.In the period of supermen and thrilling actions, viewer's eyes and perceptions are not used to such reflective dimensions. However, it appears that Victor Sjoestrom's masterpiece, based on the 1912 novel THY SOUL SHALL BEAR WITNESS by the Noble Prize winner Selma Lagerlof finds its most profound gist in that. THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE made almost 90 years ago is a milestone in Swedish cinema and a notable film that has overwhelmed eminent people of the 20th century, including Ingmar Bergman. But, I usually ask myself a question, especially before the meditative time of November, what is it that makes such films stand out as masterpieces. Is it the direction, the cinematography, special effects, narrative structure, or perhaps something less common in an ordinary discussion...?Having watched the restored version with its newly commissioned soundtrack by KTL, I had a feeling that I was watching something unique. Of course, I had heard before how significant it was for the cinema but that did not play a decisive role in my experience. I was mesmerized whilst my own subjective viewing and found this silent pearl captivating. Yes, Sjostrom's film touched me tremendously with its innovative structure of flashbacks (although there are flashbacks within flashbacks, I did not get confused), with its powerful cinematography by Julius Jaenzon, with its flawless direction by the master of Swedish cinema who plays the lead as well. The images that are in this film are really hard to forget, hard to skip. The viewer is, as if, taken to its world, experiences what the characters get through, absorbs oneself to a great extend with what one sees in this silent masterpiece. Everything seems to be balanced and crafted so well, including the movements of the camera, the extensive use of special effects, double exposures in the visualization of the ghost characters who walk in three dimensions, the tension and the performances of the great Swedish cast of the time.It is truly hard to skip the mesmerizing, symbolic, even ICONIC moments of the movie when the driver of the 'strict master' (Death) arrives at various spots, including the sea (intense visual experience), the room of a rich suicide, the streets as well as the graveyard where David (Victor Sjostrom) is to substitute his pal Georges (Tore Svennberg) on that memorable New Year's Eve. The visual feast finds its climax at the moment when David, having visited the dying Edit (Astrid Holm), the member of the Fralsningsarmen (Salvation Army), arrives finally at his home and sees the drama of his wife and children, the drama caused by his monster-like behavior. The visual moment worth high consideration is when David comes back to his home obscene and drunk, is closed in the kitchen by his wife who is afraid of tuberculosis infection and he brutally takes the axe and breaks through the door. The whole drama becomes visually and mentally so powerful that tears are running on the cheeks of a more delicate viewer. However, the greatest maturity of the film is its content so vividly derived from Selma Lagerlof's novel and so creatively executed in this picture...There is everything that human heart can experience: love, disappointment, courage, sympathy, fear, bad influence, fights, suffering, loneliness, sorrow, wretchedness, despair, but finally the glory of reconciliation and tears of joy. There are truly different psychological dimensions, or more to say, mental journeys that the director, with the masterful power of the source novel, invites us to experience. There are elements of gloom, the elements of intensive mysticism; there is a redeeming power of prayer for other people (the plot of Edit) and the gist of penance. While the film seems to touch the very heart of Christianity at certain moments, it also appears to evoke thought provoking feelings about what, in fact, is the most important value in life.The bitter experience of the leading character makes us shocked at first but...in time, indifferent to his feelings. He becomes a villain in our eyes. Although the character of Georges proves to us the consequences of bad influence, we don't see David as a victim (sort of) but as a single human being responsible for himself. We, as viewers, at certain moment, stop feeling empathy with the character but rather concentrate on other people, good people and cry with them. But, at the right moment, we seem to realize his plea to God, his fruitful tears of penance, we seem to forgive him as his wife (Hilga Borgstrom) does forgive him. The human heart appears to shout out from its depths: \"Genuine redemptive tears!\" What a drama! What a psychological feast! What a movie that evokes such feelings! That is the profoundity of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE and though that aspect may be considered difficult to capture for some viewers, I think it is an absolute necessity while analyzing this film.Although the movie has become a source of inspiration for many eminent people of cinema, I think that not all of them understood its gist in the right manner. Enthusiastically speaking, it is another silent film that proves the masterful nature of the early cinema and a film that may be seen from different angles. Nevertheless, there is also a danger that we condense its meaning to a sheer scary movie and look through the terrifying moments ignoring the rest. That would be nothing but an unforgivable conjecture. THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is a story of a joyful gift, of another chance to become mature, a redemptive chance. Masterpiece, 10/10", "Revisited this movie recently.\nThe Phantom Carriage acted and directed by Victor Sjostrom is a masterpiece on a technical level.\nIt is a supernatural tale about sins, guilt and redemption.The story is about David, a despicable drunkard, who doesn't mind spreading his pathogens on other people's faces.\nIn fact he even tells others to do so.\nIn search of her wife who ran away from him while he was in prison, David seeks shelter in a homeless shelter run by the Salvation Army Mission. Ther he is given a bed to sleep n inspite of being rude to sister Edith, she mends his jacket n in doing so she contracts his disease.\nOne year has passed n the dying sister has one last wish, to speak to David, while our drunkard is sitting in a cemetery telling his two drinking buddies about his old friend Georges, who told him about the legend that the last person to die each year has to drive Death's carriage and collect the souls of everybody who dies the following year......Of course the story is preachy, melodramatic n too simple but aft two years from the date of this review this film will be hundread years old.\nApart from the solid direction n acting, the effects are brilliant.\nThe ghostly illusion, the long shots of the carriage set against a vast dark landscape, the narrative structure with flashbacks within flashbacks, all this makes it a masterpiece considering it was made in 1921.\nGod bless the fellas at the Criterion Collection.", "One of the best silent dramas I've seen.  As dark and shadowy as anything the German Expressionists produced, but featuring performances that were quite understated and naturalistic for the day.  No camera mugging and no unintentional laughs due to wild-eyed arm-waving histrionics.  Sjostrom gave a convincing performance as the drunken, mean-spirited and frightening David Holm.Set mostly at night in a dingy Swedish slum, the film had a very claustrophobic set-bound feel to it, aided by the low key lighting and extensive use of irising.There was a deep, and typically Scandinavian, sense of despair and hopelessness to the narrative: the film begins in a rather grim present, and then we're told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks within flashbacks--a pretty complex story structure for 1921), where his character is offered numerous chances at redemption, but he doesn't take them, and we know he won't take them, because we've seen him die drunk and wretched and mean as ever in the present.  The penultimate scene is as dark as any I have seen in all of cinema.The writing and directing is tight and intelligent, even by today's standards.  In several instances, Sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing, and then pulls out a surprise.  The ending might not be such a surprise to some viewers, but I didn't see it coming.This movie deserves a full restoration and DVD release.  Or even a crappy budget release.  It just needs to be out there so people can see and appreciate it.9.5/10, which rounds up to 10/10", "Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's K\u00f6rkarlen plunges the viewer into life's lower depths for much of its running time, with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation, family violence and suicidal despair, but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of Death itself. Here Death is embodied as a ghostly horse-drawn carriage, driven by a miserable sinner who was the last person to die on the previous New Year's Eve. For one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed, and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver.The scenes involving this carriage (the film was known as \"The Phantom Carriage\" or \"The Phantom Chariot\" in English-speaking countries) are eerie and mesmerizing, utilizing double-exposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today. Most strikingly, the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned. As fascinating as these scenes are, however, the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of David Holm, played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life. In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife, children and brother, and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy. Abruptly, without segue or explanation, we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck, in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Ordinarily this leap from Before to After might feel like a story-telling deficiency, but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar, sordid details on our own. It's suggested that Holm has been led astray by his convivial friend Georges, the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the Phantom Carriage, but whatever the cause of his downfall Holm appears to be a lost cause, a mean-spirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform.While David Holm is our central figure the story's true catalyst is a young Salvation Army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself is dying-- indirectly due to her ministrations on Holm's behalf --she demands to see him, and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery.At times this film resembles Dickens' tale of Scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a flawed man to take stock of his life, suffer over his misbehavior, and reform. I was also reminded of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's 1917 drama Terje Vigen, in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone: a sequence echoed here. The director reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore, found earlier in his Berg-Ejvind och hans hustru (a.k.a. \"The Outlaw and His Wife,\" 1918) that no man can outrun his fate. This time, however, it could be argued that David Holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate, for he's given an unexpected second chance to make amends.Viewers expecting a a supernatural tale will appreciate the sequences featuring the Phantom Carriage of the title, but may not be prepared for this film's painful examination of a troubled man's alcoholic downfall. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate K\u00f6rkarlen in its entirety. It stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's most accomplished works.", "On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve night, an ill nurse, her life slowly ebbing away, demands that David Holm be presented to her at once. We don't yet know who David Holm is, or why this nurse wishes to see him, but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time. On the other side of the town, nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, who also directed) and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the New Year. \"Here we can tell just when to drink the New Year in,\" exclaims Holm, casting a finger towards the large clock tower that looms through the darkness. Little does he know, however, that he will not be alive to greet it.To pass the time, Holm cheerfully recites a ghost story. He'd once had a friend name George, \"a merry fellow\" who was \"smarter than the rest of us.\" On one New Year's Eve several years ago, George has broken up a potentially disastrous brawl, fearing that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom chariot for the next year, doing Death's bidding and collecting the souls of the deceased. \"And, gentlemen, George died last New Year's Eve!\" concludes Holm happily, not bothering to contain his mocking skepticism of the man's beliefs.As fate has it, of course, an unexpected violent encounter results in Holm's death, just on the stroke of midnight. As the man's transparent spirit rises gingerly from his earthly body, he witnesses, to his horror, the distant approach of a phantom carriage. The driver, a frail cloaked figure - a sickle clasped tightly in his hand - steps down from the carriage and approaches. We are astonished to discover that the driver is none other than a decrepit George, preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's successor.Considering the era in which 'K\u00f6rkarlen' is made, the special effects in this film are absolutely superb. Cinematographer Julius Jaenzon used double-exposure photography to create the eerie, ghostly silhouette of the carriage and its damned driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the phantom chariot travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man. Another scene, eerily reminiscent of Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining,' involves Holm breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children.Genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution, Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's 'K\u00f6rkarlen' is a fine work of cinema, successfully portraying Holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment, and a final hopeful possibility of redemption.", "Had I known this was going to turn out as deeply awesome as it did, I would have perhaps saved it for a time of need. I'm always looking for spiritual visions that permit a journey inwards, but they are so few in the grand scheme that I'm grateful for each and every one. I try to cherish them because they let me watch from the heart. It's why I keep myself from finishing off the rest of Tarkovsky's films - I want to know that there's always a drink of fresh water at hand when I'm parching.I came to this, like most people I presume, for its reputation as a horror film where the reaper gets out to harvest souls. I collect these as well but for different reasons, and was expecting here something more or less expressionist. As with most silents however, it's not really horror by our contemporary sense; horror in these films comes from more directly abstract notions, guilt, humiliation, spiritual damnation, and it's usually with the intent to distill a life lesson. They may seem outdated now but only because we presume to know these things and so reckon that no further guidance is necessary - while we, self-sufficient modern humans in perfect control of our destinies, continue to live our lives in random iterations.Here death itself. The journey of the soul in the world inside the soul. Like earlier texts of this journey, Dante's Inferno or the Egyptian Book of the Dead, it is advisable, imperative even, that we read beyond the feverish vision of the beyond. That we read between the collective dream the author has dreamed up as meant to await us and contemplate on why we dreamed in the first place.The man who dies last on New Year's Eve - at the cusp of new life, and so at the start of a new cosmic round - becomes Death's driver for the coming year, this is the premise. He ferries the vehicle - and us as passengers - where the journey inwards or across can begin. Our man contemplates the chain of events that brought him lying dead before the carriage of death.The opening chapters in the Book of the Dead that propel the process of rebirth, and which pertain very much here, are thus named: \"The chapter of making Osiris S. possess a memory in the Underworld\" and next \"the chapter of giving Osiris S. a heart in the Underworld\".The man remembers, he had a perfectly good life and family but blew it up like so many we know of. He goes into prison and comes out reborn again with realization of what his deeds brought him. But he has to start again, like every new life he has to build his again from nothing. Instead he drags himself through this next life in a limbo of guilt and seething hatred. It is this unswathing of the spirit across different worlds that matters, and the dissolution in each one granting passage in the next. How strong karmas resonate from one existence to the other, powering the cart. Death's driver is granting the visions after all.There is a woman in all of this, a nurse for the Salvation Army. From her end, she is looking to hear from god. We see from both ends, her trying to save who she considers a mandate from god and on the other side the man who is wrestling personal demons. If god doesn't speak through him, then he never spoke at all. In a beautiful scene, she spends the night mending his torn soul; when he wakes up, furious at the kindness, he tears it up again for spite.More great cinema about the karmas metaphysically weaving together the participants: having failed to mend him, the woman literally contracts his illness. And when the man violently attacks with an axe a locked door, his wife on the other side falls to die.The man finally wakes up from death though, having prayed and thus lay himself prostrate before a higher force. This is likely a part that modern viewers will find hard to swallow. But this is the thing; it is not literal death in these texts, never was. The underworld the soul must travel through to be reborn on the other side is always inside, why it's so often called a 'descent', and so the power to make a full transit by learning again life-value through the different levels always rests with the soul. What the man learns at the moment of prayer is the humility that shatters ego. Of course he is forgiven. One of the final chapters in that ancient Egyptian text reads: \"chapter of causing a man to come back upon his house on earth\". Notice that the dead man is no longer symbolically referred (and so protected) by the name of the god Osiris, having passed the horrible tribulations, now the deity is embodied inside.So god does speak after all through this man, but it speaks to her who was looking to apprehend him and so, no doubt, will hear his voice in the miracle. From our perspective seeing deeper into these lives, our perspective itself dislocated from bodies and wandering with the spirits, we know there was no god: the miraculous transformation on the visible level was only the last step in a painful, arduous process of healing the heart. It's a powerful notion, worth two or three Seals (Bergman).So it's really only us who can mend ourselves. It's a lesson, make no mistake, but a lesson worth keeping. Simply said, it sounds trite - most anything does if the words are not right. The man was told after all, no doubt he understood in some capacity, but it meant nothing. Which is why it's important to journey from the heart.Something to meditate upon.", "Not as well known as the English, American, German and French cinema, though cinema from Sweden from the '20's was also quite good, interesting and revolutionary.This is a movie that is made great by its story. The story is told in 'A Christmas Carol' kind of way, in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past, present and what could have been. It's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well. The message comes across as very powerful and effective. This is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of Swedish cinema; Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m.The story is based on the novel by other Swedish author Selma Lagerl\u00f6f. The story is adapted by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m himself, who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements, to let the story and movie flow better. It perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful one.The movie does not only have a great story, it also is a good looking one. The movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it past, present and 'future'.Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m did not only wrote and directed this movie, he also plays the main character. Of course the acting in the movie is over-the-top at times, by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early German movies was the case. And after all, this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting, so it really doesn't matter much, or distracts.A really great and effective underrated silent-movie classic from Sweden.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "In the New Year's Eve, the tuberculous sister of the Salvation Army Edit (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m) to visit her in her deathbed. Meanwhile, the alcoholic David is telling to two other drunkards in the cemetery the legend of the Phantom Coach and his coachman: in accordance with the legend, the last sinner to die in the turn of the New Year becomes the soul collector, gathering souls in his coach. When David denies to visit Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died in the end of the last year. George revisits parts of David's obnoxious life and in flashbacks, he shows how mean and selfish David was.\"K\u00f6rkarlen\" is an impressive and stylish silent movie, with magnificent special effects (for a 1921 movie). The characters are very well developed; however, the story is dated and there is a weird and unexplained situation, when Sister Edit tells that she loves David Holm. Why should a enlightened woman love such a despicable man that wasted his life corrupting other people? Despite being religiously dated in the present days, it gives a beautiful message of faith and redemption in the end. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"A Carro\u00e7a Fantasma\" (\"The Phantom Coach\")", "Victor Sjostrom's silent film masterpiece The Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo, comprising American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian laptop artist Peter Rehberg, has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921. An ominous banging sound introduces each Act and a medley of drones, guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds.As impressive as the new soundtrack is, the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage, collecting the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the anti-hero of the film, David Holm, who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage.This film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label, the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others. Sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as the drunken, spiteful and menacing Holm in life, and the wretched, frightened Holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds.Striking imagery abounds throughout The Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The ill-omened onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clock-face hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon. Equally impressively, the dead are depicted through pioneering semi-transparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch.Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by KTL is a superb accentuation of its themes. This is a must-see.", "It's undeniable that The Phantom Carriage's influence precedes itself. From its iconography of the grim reaper, it's Christmas Carol-esque tale of repentance, to echoes of Jack Nicholson chopping down the door in The Shining. If The Phantom Carriage is known for anything, it's for being Ingmar Bergman's source of inspiration for what his films would later muse upon. He would later recruit director and star Victor Sjostrom to lead on of his most acclaimed films Wild Strawberries. Of course, we already know how profound these concepts are nearly 100 years later and their importance is still imbedded in the film. It's fascinating to watch inventive techniques of translucence portrayed on screen too, though admittedly the prior year's Caligari is more impressive. Its real problem is undisciplined structure and its resulting poor pacing, but these are archaic issues of silent cinema that required a few years of trial and error. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is palpable, the ideas are timeless and it oozes with passion from Sjostrom, if not as nightmare worthy as the next year's Nosferatu.8/10", "This film is a masterpiece to put it simply. Especially the double exposure made by the cameraman Julius Jaenzon. It is skillfully made even with the standards we are used to today seventy eight years later. Viktor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, the director, also plays the main character, David Holm. On the night of new years eve he is killed in a fight, and the legend says that the first one who dies on the new year, will have to work as a soul-collector in the form of a transparent ghost. There is a new soul-collector to be appointed every year.The scene in which the alcoholic, David Holm, rises up from his dead body (like the soul is leaving his earthly body) in the churchyard (where the fight took place) is a real award for a filmloving eye. Also when the present soul-collector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene. David Holm recognizes this soul-collector as a drinkingfriend from earlier life. It is now his turn to take over. Just like Scrooge in Dickens story \"A christmas tale\", David is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him.The film is about the danger of abusing drugs, in this case alcohol. It is based upon a book by Nobel prize winner Selma Lagerl\u00f6f. Viktor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m filmed a few more of her books, but this is the one with the best outcome, maybe because this book is the most filmic of them.", "K\u00f6rkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies, directed by Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f8m, who also plays the male main role, is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerl\u00f6f. The film tells the story of brutal drinker David Holm, who beats up his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits toward the end of the year together with his boozing buddies in the city-park and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot (K\u00f6rkarlen): Who dies in the New Year's Eve night as the last one before dawn, has to serve one year long as driver of Death and release the dying souls from their bodies. But David gets into a fight with his buddies, suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the soil. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage is approaching. The driver is nobody else than David's late friend Georges who seduced him into alcohol and died one year before. Since David refuses to get on the carriage, Georges forces him. Together, they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from David. They visit the nurse Edit whose love to David he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis so that she is dying now. But her unconditioned love to David will save his soul. Fulfilled with her spirit, they get to David's wife and children. David is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children, because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother, who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by David. David asks Georges to go back into his body, because he finally sees that his way was wrong. Since it was Georges who had seduced him once into drinking, David's wish is granted, he gets a second chance, and Georges has to be one more year the driver of the Phantom Carriage in order to pay for his own sins. This movie belongs probably to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Deplorably, it is still not available on international DVD.", "Much said without words.This is an excellent movie. It was made in color-not color as in today's films, but a special mono-color use (with shadings) that portrayed meaning, mood, sense and time. It should be seen in color, as it becomes an entirely different film. The story, by Nobel prize-winner Selma Lagerl\u00f6f, is effectively presented. One never has a clear sense of real, memory or phantom. Changes going on in Swedish society at the time are subtly layered. Most highly recommend. Try to rent it or find it on-line. I saw it in a Swedish film class and I want to add it to my film library.", "The best silent movie I've ever seen. It's so harrowing and perfectly describes the feelings I've had about death, life, love and especially hope. It's optimistic ending makes it even stronger. I cried when I saw this movie the first time, which was the day after my grandfather's death.He once told me this was the first movie he ever saw, in a cinema, to which there was a 10 kilometers walk in the snow. The cinema used to be so crowded the humidity got so high the walls were completely wet. Naturally I had a lot in mind that day. It wasn't the first time I saw the movie, but the first time I experienced it's meaning completely. I've never seen any silent film like this and that it's silent actually makes it scarier.", "This is perhaps among the best movies ever made. If you rent it or buy it, and take the time to see it you will never regret it. If you are tired of reviews, you can stop reading here....now run along and get it.Based on Nobel laureate Selma Lagerl\u00f6fs tale about a carriage driving around on New Years eve, collecting the souls of the dead.The tale is at once a ghost story, a morality and a social statement much like the best of Charles Dickens. The film was made when movies were very young but as with many of those pictures by Lang, Murnau, Wiene and even Stiller, they remain very modern both in language and story. (In those days the best movies were made in Europe; Griffith seems ridiculous compared to this.)The film was made in heaven by a true genius, Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m. By the time he started to dabble with pictures he was an actor employed by the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre. He not only directed the movie, he played one of the main characters and built the backgrounds when needed. To help him along came camera man Julius Janzon and those two created magic much like Orson Welles and Gregg Toland would do on Citizen Kane, later.If you're not simply captured by the movie, think of this: Janzon double exposed up to x9 to gain the ghost effects; on a hand turned movie camera.For Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, just to prove his genius, he moved to Hollywood to make a few movies including masterful renditions like \"He Who Gets Slapped\" with Lon Chaney and \"The Scarlet letter\" with Lilian Gish. Both are masterpieces and if you see these movies you will recognize Sj\u00f6str\u00f6ms mark. Some say he left Hollywood, disappointed, after having seen Stiller been treated bad by Hollywood's \"industry\". Legend or not, he did leave.Ingmar Bergman gave Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m a tender and loving exit part; a beautiful homage; in his legendary \"Wild Strawberries\" from 1957. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m played old professor of medicine, Isaac Borg, traveling through Sweden and at the same time through the memories of his life. Wild Strawberries in turn is another legendary film...but that's another story.", "Experiencing THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE in the wee hours of new year's morning was as haunting as advertised. The film is nothing if not a technical accomplishment in visual storytelling and uses everything from translucent super-impositions, multiple-exposures, colour-tinted photography to create some stunningly unsettling imagery. The relatively straight-forward supernatural account is told through a complex series of meandering flashbacks and eventually works like morality tale much like Dickens' A Christmas Carol. My viewing pleasure was further elevated by the spectacularly moody experimental score by KTL - creepy, uninhibited, atmospheric that brilliantly complements the eerie visuals. Matti Bye's orchestral score is more conventionally buoyant and might get a tad overbearing at times.Going in I was aware of Bergman's reverence for TPC and the impact it had on some of his more famous works particularly THE SEVENTH SEAL and WILD STRAWBERRIES but had absolutely no clue that it also served as the inspiration for the famous \"Here's Johnny\" sequence in THE SHINING! THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is one of the best advertisements of early, inventive bag-of-tricks film- making and necessary recounting of one of the most important life lessons - Not getting killed on New Year's Eve ;)", "This, unfortunately, is a little-known film.....i say \"unfortunately\", because it ranks up there with the \"classics\" of the American silent screen!It's about a legend of a \"phantom chariot\" that travells all over the world, picking up the souls of those who have died.   The legend says tha the last person to die on New Year's Eve is condemned to drive the chariot for the next whole year.It brings to mind the sequence of the \"Ghost of Future Yet To Come\" in Dicken's famous \"Christmas Carol\".The double-exposure effects of the ghosts (esp. when they interact with the \"live\" people) are EXCELLENT!If you love silent films, you MUST see THIS; it will \"blow you away\"!Norm VogelNorm's Old Movie Heaven http://www.nvogel.com/film/film.html", "It's not clear whether director/actor Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was directly influenced by the Dickens classic \"A Christmas Carol\" (1843), or for that matter whether the novel upon which this film is based, \"Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!\" (1912), borrowed Dickens' idea. The stories are very similar, but there's one striking difference. \"The Phantom Carriage\" has a distinctly darker, gloomier, colder (some might say \"Swedisher\") feel to it that makes it perfect for this kind of morality tale.In this case our \"Scrooge\" is \"David Holm\" a hateful, alcoholic, wife-abusing, child-abusing, misanthropic sociopath. Yeah he makes Scrooge look like the tooth fairy. David Holm causes pain and suffering everywhere he goes, infecting people with his depravity just as he tries to infect them with tuberculosis by coughing in their faces (and it should be noted that the novel \"Thy Soul Shall Bear Witness!\" was originally intended to be an essay on tuberculosis and the dangers of contagion).Like Dickens' supernaturally charged Christmas Eve, this story happens on a mystical New Years Eve, except that New Years Eve has a dark legend associated with it: every year at the stroke of midnight, the last soul to die is condemned to be Death's coachman for 1 year. And we learn through ominous and woeful images that this is a horrible job of constant labor, met with nothing but tragedy and sorrow.One thing leads to another, and perhaps you can guess, David Holm meets Death's coachman. The Coachman is sympathetic to David, for reasons you will learn, so instead of bundling David up like a side of beef and dumping him in the carriage as he does with all the other souls, he takes David on a tour of his life. He shows him what his life could have been, what it was, and in a wrenching revelation, what is happening that very night as he lays dead.\"The Phantom Carriage\" has some wonderful special effects that are timeless in their simplicity. We see ghostly apparitions, we see souls leaving bodies, we see the terrifying old carriage driving through desolate streets, barren landscapes, and even over water. It must've been quite a chore to pull this off with the technology of 100 years ago, but it still stands up today.It has been said that this film deeply influenced the great directors Ingmar Bergman and Stanley Kubrick. Definitely one scene in particular will give fans of \"The Shining\" a peek into what inspired the famous axe chopping \"Here's Johnny!\" A more careful analysis of the cinematography will reveal a lot of other historical goodies I'm sure. But whether you're viewing this as a historical marker, or like me, just watching it for pure enjoyment and wonder, \"The Phantom Carriage\" shouldn't be missed.", "... although it often plays in October for the Halloween season. It's more of a morality tale about a wastrel who for some reason, for a dying Salvation Army Sister, is \"the man she loves\". This guy is a married man AND a complete waste of flesh and her Salvation Army compadres have no problem with this? Maybe there is a mistranslation in the subtitles, but this has always confused me, and the Criterion copy with commentary sheds no light on the subject.I'm sure the Salvation Army sister had the best of intentions, but earlier in the film she intentionally reunited the wastrel and his wife, and he ends up infecting the wife with his deadly disease! Of course everybody he infects ends up getting sicker much more quickly than he does. Such are the mysteries of the human immune system and patient zero.The film has to do with the last person dying for the year - or maybe it is the first person dying in the new year - having to drive \"The Phantom Carriage\" which collects the souls of the newly dead for the next calendar year. Now this\nthing collects the souls of all of the dead on earth, so I'm not sure how people in India or China would feel about having to ride - or even being required to drive - this phantom carriage which is covered in Christian symbols. I wonder how that worked?Even with all of the unanswered questions this raised, I'd really recommend it. For sure it shows that the European film industry was very much ahead of the Americans in the early 1920s. The direction and acting are very good, and it is interesting to see Victor Sjostrom so early in his acting career and then watch him in \"Wild Strawberries\" 36 years later.", "Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was quite the master in this film, having starred in it, directed it and even wrote the screenplay! That's pretty amazing. While today few have any idea who Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m was, he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman's most acclaimed films, WILD STRAWBERRIES.As far as this film goes, it's a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because for 1921, it's a very good film. The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an amazingly dated and preachy film--more like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap--a very sad and confusing sap. Why is she \"in love\" with this man? Am I missing something?So, my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents (like me), then by all means watch it. But, if you aren't a silent fan, this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated.", "\"The Phantom Carriage\" (known as \"K\u00f6rkarlen,\" or \"The Wagoner\" in Sweden) opens with a young woman dying in a convent on New Year's Eve in remote Sweden. Meanwhile, David Holm, the man she repeatedly asks to be sent to her bedside, is getting drunk in a cemetery; he dies that evening, and is plunged into an odyssey in which he is taken by a phantom carriage. The carriage is driven by his former friend, who was, in accordance with folkore, forced to drive the grim reaper's carriage for the entire year due to having been the last person on earth to die before the dawn of the new year.Though lauded by most all who have seen it, \"The Phantom Carriage\" is surprisingly less-known than one may think it would be, especially considering it was the film that influenced Ingmar Bergman to become a filmmaker. In Sweden, it is deservedly heralded as a national classic. It is a seasonal film in that it takes place on the New Year's Eve holiday, a pivotal theme for the film. In many ways, it operates as something of a macabre relative to Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" possessing similar levels of rumination on death, despair, and the human condition. It is a considerably darker story, however, and has more in common with the horror and fantasy genres than \"A Christmas Carol.\"A great deal of the praise for the film has centered on its cinematography, which is absolutely deserved. It's beautifully photographed, from the sepia-toned interior scenes to the icy blue outdoor sequences; the chilly Swedish countryside is captured hauntingly, and the shifting colors indicating the multiple time frames is effective. The special effects, though simplistic, have also been a major point of interest, as it is one of the earliest films to feature such sophisticated use of double-exposure that is still impressive and visually compelling to this day. Visual elements aside, the film is also just narratively sophisticated, and weaves an intricate and thematically rich plot in spite of its silent format.Overall, \"The Phantom Carriage\" is one of silent cinema's greats. It's visually stunning and loaded with compelling and haunting images, but it's also sophisticated merely in terms of storytelling. A great, somewhat more sinister pairing with \"A Christmas Carol,\" fitting for a cold night in late December. 10/10.", "It remind me of a tale from Christmass that we are all familiar. The phantom or spirit guiding the wreched soul through the times he did wrong when he could do right. It is worth mentioning the story makes you think about human activities and how each interaction is impacting the collective. Sort of a butterfly effect. A good deed can benefit many in the long run, and a bad deed can spoil already hurt people even worst. The prayer that is given in the end of the movie is important to put it in use every New Years Eve. Soul maturity is the upper goal of collective consiousness.Last, I was impressed by the way spirit world was shown, gonna use this tip for sure.", "Sj\u00f6str\u00f6ms masterpiece and a movie that captures the swedish soul . It also served as a great inspiration for Bergman; the similarites between K\u00f6rkarlen and Smultronst\u00e4llet (with Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m in the leading role as Isak Borg) from 1957 is not a coincidence. Don't miss it for the world!", "My Rating : 10/10 \u2660 MASTERPIECE \u2660Finally finished watching this epic silent movie and just Wow! The special effects are off the charts, the storyline is deep and meaningful and I guess this is what cinema is all about!Charlie Chaplin said this was the greatest movie he'd ever seen. Bergman said he'd watch this film once every year and was a massive influence on him thus leading to 'Wild Strawberries'.A must-watch for cinephiles!"], "tt0012494": ["I don't know why, but one of my favorite film genres is German Expressionism. Like American film noir, it creates a dark vision of human existence from which a flowering of truth unfolds. And this truth is not what the protagonist wants to hear and comes at a great price.  I love this stuff.I recently had the opportunity to view \"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" theatrically, and it was pure heaven. Billed as Fritz Lang's first big hit, it's easy to see why. Filled with lavish spectacle and special effects, the film still maintains it's human level. And such a story: a young newlywed husband is taken by Death on his honeymoon. As in a fairytale, the bride is able to confront Death and beg for you her husbands return. Death will grant her this if she can once cheat him of one who is about to die. She is given three chances to pull off this trick, which transport her to Persia, Venice and China. Death, her husband and herself are characters in each of these fanciful locales. All this leads back to a gripping finale in Germany where it all began.As far as silent movies go, this is one of the best.", "The excellent atmosphere and absorbing story make Fritz Lang's \"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" (or \"Destiny\") one of the little-known gems of the early 1920s. In most other movies, the top-quality special visual effects would be the strongest part of the film, but here they are really just a valuable addition to a story that already had a lot to offer.The atmosphere and the story also fit together very well, with the foreboding, Gothic tone and the expressionistic settings complementing an involved story of life, death, fear, and love. The plot is creative and quite interesting in itself, and it also suggests some important themes in the decisions that the characters face.Lil Dagover gets what might be her best role, as she gets the opportunity to do quite a few different things with her character. Bernhard Goetzke excels in his forbidding role. Between the two of them, they get most of the best moments, with Lang's wonderfully conceived settings and camera tricks giving them plenty to work with.Because it has so much going for it, this is a movie that works well both as entertainment and as a statement about humanity.", "Der Mude Tod/Destiny(1921) was the film where Fritz Lang began sharpening his trademarks of emotional and visual motifs.  Focuses on themes Fritz Lang obsessed over in film and life.  For instance, the conflict between love and death is faced by many protagonists(male or female) in numerous Fritz Lang pics.  From Destiny(1921) to the director's final film, 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse(1960), Fritz Lang was occupied in his work by philosophies on death, life, love, notion of the after life, and redemption.  The visual brilliance of Lang's later Silent films can be traced to this feature.Figure of death is a compelling and sympathetic Lang character whose task is not an easy one.  The character of death in Destiny(1921) does what is required of him without any subjective bias on the people he has to collect. Bernhard Goetzke puts on screen with his performance the most fascinating portrayal of death in a motion picture.  The figure of death in Destiny(1921) is a lonely and sad figure whose wish is to do something else. The title of the film refers to death's inability to move outside of his destiny.Der Mude Tod/Destiny(1921) was influential to directors of the silent and sound eras.  Luis Bunuel was impressed by its amazing visual and sad qualities(thus the film became an influential force in most of Bunuel's work).  It wouldn't be surprising that Destiny(1921) also influenced Ingmar Bergman especially with The Seventh Seal(1957).  Other filmmakers influenced includes Enzo G.Castellari, Mario Bava, Roger Corman, and Terry Gilliam. The film's influences can be looked at in films as Lisa and the Devil(1972), Masque of the Red Death(1964), Keoma(1976), and Brazil(1985).Candleroom sequence is a moment of floating beauty and surreal grace.  The candleroom is an extraordinary visual set with a great deal of imagination put into it.  The Candleroom is symbolic of the place where the Grim reaper watches over to see whose candle(life) will be put out.  An excellent effect involves a candle glow dissolving into a baby.  The Candleroom sequence has some terrific visual effects that blow away the CGI of today's motion pictures.Contains a slateful of extraordinary visuals typical of a German Expressionistic film of that time.  In films such as Destiny(1921), Fritz Lang used an aura of expressionistic imagery to display different emotions from his main characters.  Visual use of the camera reaches its climatic level during the three tales.  An example of why silent films where for the most part a great visual experience compared to many sound pictures. Destiny(1921) matches the astonishing imagery of Die Nibelungen(1924), Metropolis(1927), and Dr. Mabuse Der Spieler(1922) with excellent visuals of its own.Out of Sympathy for a woman whose beloved died, the grim reaper gives her a chance to save one of three lives as exchange of return of beloved.  Tale one takes place in Persia with forbidden love affair between Arab woman and Western adventurer.  Tragic tale that benefits from director's imaginary use of Persian locations.  The female protagonist attempts to save the adventurer to no avail.  Least interesting of the three tales and most slow moving.Second tale involves a love triangle with the city of Venice as the story's backdrop.  The woman of this tale is promised to a man of well known prestige who she doesn't love.  Her love is to someone who is not popular and the opposite of her finace.  Includes an ingenious death plot that is similar to a situation in Marquis De Sade story, ERNESTINE:A SWEDISH TALE. Her plans ends up in a manner that the woman least hoped for.The Imperial China tale is the third and best of the three tales. Magnificent camera effects gives it a mythical quality that creates a feel for the spectacle.  An astonishing effect and maybe the director's most amazing effect in his silent films involves the creation by a magician of an army of toy sized soldiers.  Deals with the Emperor of China who wants the magician's female assistent who is loved by the male assistent.  Magical feeling of the amazing and bizarre is what makes the third tale something fantastic.\"Love is Stronger than death\" is a good title for a potential documentary of the life and film works of Fritz Lang.  More than any other line in a Fritz Lang film, \"Love is Stronger than death\" represents a summary of Fritz Lang's filmography.  \"Love is Stronger than death\" deals with Fritz Lang's ideals about metaphysical love that goes beyond the confines of the mortal world.  Destiny(1921) deals with this notion with use of abstract and metaphysical imagery.  \"Love is Stronger than death\" can also be applied to the films of Mario Bava because of his similar fatalistic take on the topic of love.After watching it for the first time, I consider Destiny(1921) among the director's finest silent films.  An act of courage is performed by the heroine thus making her a tragic figure.  Acting from the cast shines with moments of expressionistic beauty.  Magificently envisioned by a master of expressionistic filmmaking.  Destiny(1921) shows Fritz Lang's growth as an artist and his capabilites to become a legendary film director.", "In a small village somewhere in time, a stranger lease for ninety-nine years a field annex to the cemetery and surround it with a very high wall without gate. When a young couple of travelers stop in a local tavern for resting, the fianc\u00e9 vanishes and her fianc\u00e9e seeks him and meets his spirit entering through the wall. She finds an entrance and finds that the stranger is actually Death, who is tired of bringing suffering to the world. She begs for the life of her beloved fianc\u00e9, and Death proposes her to save one of three lives that are in the end. If she succeeds, Death will bring her lover back to live. The lady becomes a woman in Persia, in Venice and in China, and in all situations she fails to save her respective lover. Death gives her one last chance, if she manages to find within one hour a person in the village that could give up living. When the local hospital is burning in fire, the young woman realizes the only way to stay with her lover.\"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" is another magnificent fantasy of the genius Fritz Lang. Ingmar Berman was certainly influenced and inspired by this stunning film with his masterpiece \"Det Sjunde Inseglet\" (a.k.a. \"The Seventh Seal\"). It is amazing how Fritz Lang was able to generate shadows and special effects with the primitive apparatuses in the incipient cinema. Further, the originality of his screenplays is absolutely impressive. \"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" shows wonderful fantasy about the duel between love and death, with a beautiful message in the end, proving that love is stronger than death. My admiration for this master increases after watching each of his movies. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"A Morte Cansada\" (\"The Tired Death\")", "The films of Weimar Germany are an interesting and exciting period to study. They share a rich cultural heritage, similar themes and revolutionary film styles and techniques. \"Destiny\" (Der M\u00fcde Tod) is the earliest mature work I've seen from Fritz Lang, one of the period's principal filmmakers--much better than the Spiders series. It's somewhat expressionistic, in the loose sense usually applied to these films, which is to say it's thematically dark and, occasionally, photographed and designed intentionally to affect mood and express emotions. An exceptional crew of cinematographers and art directors, as in many of the best films of the period, support the director.Yet, I think the narrative has its faults; the frame narrative is great, but only the last of the three episodes within was entertaining--for its light and magical treatment. In the film, a girl's young lover dies, and Death offers her three tries to resurrect his life. The episodes are flimsy at times, but some impressive imagery and powerful performances by Lil Dagover and Bernhard Goetzke make up for much of that. Additionally, the exotic Arabian, historical Venetian and Chinese settings for the three inner episodes are well rendered, surely, but it's the haunting graveyard scenes and the meetings with Death, especially the room of candles scenes, that I'll remember. They're not merely exotic; they're otherworldly--the atmospheric, moving and imaginative places I want movies to take me.", "The biographical entry for Fritz Lang in the invaluable World Film Directors reference book offers a revealing quote. It seems that when he was a teenager he became gravely ill, and at the peak of his delirium experienced a vivid hallucination. As Lang later described it, \"I saw myself face to face, not terrifying, but unmistakable, with Death . . . I don't know whether I should call the feeling I experienced at that moment one of fear. It was horror, but not panic. I recovered quickly, but the love of death, compounded of horror and affection . . . stayed with me and became a part of my films.\" Lang, who was Austrian, served in the Army during the First World War where he saw considerable combat and, of course, encountered death on a horrific scale. (He also lost the use of his right eye.) While still in the service he launched his career in the movies by submitting screenplays to producer Joe May, and soon afterward acted in two of May's films, playing the Angel of Death in \"Hilde Warren und der Tod.\" Lang began directing in 1919 and was successful almost immediately but remained largely unknown outside Germany until his first genuinely personal project, \"Der M\u00fcde Tod,\" burst upon the scene in 1921 and became an international sensation. Lang's timing was perfect, for in the troubled period following the war interest in spiritualism and the afterlife was intense. This film represented the director's most thorough exploration of the fever dream of his adolescence, for here Lang utilized elements gathered from the myth and folkloric traditions of various cultures to explore a question posed by the leading lady to the Grim Reaper himself: Is Love stronger than Death?In the opening scenes we're introduced to a happy young couple who intend to marry. On their travels they encounter a stranger, a gaunt and unsmiling figure in a black cloak who is heading for the same village that is their destination; the very sight of him darkens the atmosphere and kills their joyous mood. The stranger is Death himself, who seeks to purchase land owned by the village elders. The stranger informs the elders that he is weary-- from his exertions during the Great War? --and wishes to settle down. Once he buys land the stranger erects an estate surrounded by an impossibly high wall, a wall with no apparent door or entryway, and his next act is to claim the soul of the Young Man. The Young Woman searches the village and fails to find her fianc\u00e9, but when she takes poison she is able to pass through the wall and confront Death. He takes her to a room filled with candles representing the souls of humanity. When the Young Woman demands that Death restore her fianc\u00e9 to life he agrees to do so only if she can defeat him, and he gives her three opportunities.The Young Woman's three chances to defeat Death unfold in the form of three tales set in disparate parts of the world in three different historical periods: Persia in the days of the Caliphate, Renaissance Venice, and Imperial China. Three incarnations of her Young Man are threatened with extinction, and three incarnations of the Young Woman have a chance to rescue him. These stories make up the bulk of the movie and each is longer and more elaborate than the one preceding. Eventually, when the Young Woman proves unable to beat Death she is given one final chance to win back her fianc\u00e9, but when she finds the price demanded of her too high to pay, the lovers are nonetheless reunited in the afterlife in a strangely gratifying finale.The historical adventures take place in highly stylized worlds, especially the Chinese segment, but even the film's Middle-European framing story features expressionistic structures that resemble stage sets, just as the (unnamed) young man and woman at the center of these events are meant to embody folkloric archetypes rather than dimensional characters. Lang's Persia, Venice and China suggest a child's notion of what these places might be like; the palaces have the look of enormous doll-houses. And of course the magical element is derived from fairy tales: the Chinese magician summons a miniature army of soldiers to amuse the Emperor, and is himself later turned into a cactus (one of the film's most memorable and disturbing images), while the Emperor is a fairy tale villain with grotesquely long claw-like fingernails. \"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" is, with Maurice Tourneur's 1918 classic \"The Blue Bird,\" one of the cinema's first great flights of fantasy, suffused with imaginative effects and whimsical touches but undergirded with a deep sense of sadness.Like many silent films this one has been shown in a variety of editions over the years, but the restoration completed in 2000 that is now available on DVD from Image Entertainment appears to be the closest to Lang's original version. This edition recreates the color tints of 1921 and the type-faces of the original title cards, which attempted to capture the exotic calligraphic styles of the three foreign lands of the adventure stories. (My only criticism is that I found the \"Persian\" type rather difficult to read.) This disc also boasts a beautiful score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, music that enhances the visuals without drawing undue attention to itself. For those who can't attend a public screening of this rarely shown gem the Image DVD is about as good as silent movies get on the home screen; and Fritz Lang's \"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" is one of the most fascinating silent movies.", "I really was impressed by Fritz Lang's \"Destiny\". It seemed like the pictorialization of a timeless German fable rather than a figment of Lang's imagination. The story of a young woman in medieval times whose beloved fianc\u00e9e is taken by death while they travel through a small village, it is timelessly haunting even now. It must have really hit people hard in 1921 Germany, three years after the death and destruction of WWI. The framing story is set around three mini-stories set in ancient Persia, Renaissance Venice and China. These stories are well done and diverting, but also a bit distracting from the poignant main story which was what I really responded to. Lang seemed totally assured and powerful as a filmmaker even in 1921. Lil Dagover was affecting as the heroine and Bernhard Goetzke gave a powerful and moving performance as Death. He was also great in Joe May's \"The Indian Tomb\" released in 1921 also. I highly recommend \"Destiny\" or \"Der Mude Tod\" to anyone at all interested in silent film or the career of Fritz Lang.", "One of Fritz Lang's lesser known - and, sadly, lesser shown - films is DESTINY, a haunting and beautiful film about a woman who wishes to rescue her lover from the clutches of Death, and travels to the past to do so. Filled with incredible images, this is both a visual treat - as you would expect from Lang - and also a bittersweet love story. An obvious influence on Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL, this was also the film which made Luis Bunuel want to become a director. If you ever get the chance to see this, grab it. As important and impressive a silent film as SUNRISE or GREED.", "Directed by Fritz Lang, best known for his masterpiece \"M\", \"Der Mude Tod\" stands as probably his best early work.  A silent classic, it tells the story of a young couple in a small German village and their encounter with the personification of death in a form of mysterious stranger that appears in a tavern and sits to their table indicating that the time is up for the young husband.  After the death of her beloved the young woman is so desperate that she finally manages to enter the kingdom of dead and stand face to face with personification of Death himself (a major influence on Ingmar Bergman's Death figure in the Seventh Seal later) and ask him to give her beloved back to her. The Death finally yields to her persistence and agrees to deliver back the life of her husband, but only if she manages to find any person that would give up his life in exchange. She desperatly tries to convince various people to give up, beginning from a very old man and coming as far as Asylum for mentally ill but all in vain, for how bad the life of poor guys is, they are still very much reluctant to give it up, but it's only the beginning, the center of the film being three different stories of lost love, told by Death to the young woman, similar to her own, but set in three different exotic locations such as: China, Venice and Turkey.A really amazing silent film, very romantic story but at the same time a moral tale with philosophical message in it. A must see. 10/10", "Have said more than once about highly appreciating silent films. Likewise with Fritz Lang, a great director whose best films were genre landmarks and massively influential. Had heard so much about 'Destiny', all of it never less than good and many even considering it a masterpiece. Also about it being a major influence on other great directors and that it was Lang's first notable critical success. So naturally wanted to see the fuss was about, as is the case with many acclaimed films.'Destiny' to me was a fantastic film. As far as silent films go, its one of the greats and it is not hard at all to see why it was Lang's first critical success. It is from personal opinion among his best early work and comes close to being one of his best overall (if no 'Metropolis' or 'M'), plus it is in no way a surprise that Ingmar Bergman with 'The Seventh Seal', Hitchcock and Luis Bunuel were influenced by 'Destiny'. Bunuel even said along the lines of it opening his eyes to cinema.It would have been an even better film if the pacing in the middle act was tighter, the film does slow down a little too much and becomes less eventful.The main story though is beautifully done, unsettling and sometimes darkly creepy in atmosphere and also very poignant. Not to mention that very haunting ending that stays with you long after. The last of the three imagined scenarios, in a very interestingly structured and always cohesively so story, is the best, it has the most momentum and has the most emotion in an almost poetic way. The range of mood and different kinds of expressions are vast and any shifts are seamless.Even more masterful, and what makes 'Destiny' the fantastic film that it is, are Lang's direction and especially the visuals. At this point of his career, Lang's direction is some of his most mature and ambitious and he shows no signs of being taxed or biting off more than he could chew. 'Destiny' is a towering achievement visually, a masterpiece of composition with even more extravagant setting than usually seen in silents at that time, gorgeous and quite creative photography and special effects that still makes one go wow.Found the characters interesting, with a relatable female lead character and one of the most layered personifications of Death, while formidable he is not all out evil. Lil Dagover is movingly expressive and doesn't resort to histrionics. Bernhard Goetzke gives one of the most powerful portrayals of Death to exist on film and while Walter Janssen is not quite on Dagover and Goetzke's level, his roles not being as interesting, his presence still appeals.All in all, fantastic and nearly a masterpiece, with the sole exception of its lagging mid section. 9/10", "Wonderfully haunting in its images, this early Lang film has recently been reissued on DVD under the title Destiny.  A title I have heard about for years, it is a pleasure to see it in a finely restored format that does justice to its beauty.  The film is made up of four stories, a framing sequence and three historical vignettes, related by the central theme of a woman trying to defy Death to save her lover.  While the plots are simple, the telling is astonishing in vision and execution and each of the four stories has a distinctive, entertaining tone -- the brooding expressionistic framing piece, a tale of Arabian adventure, a Renaissance romance, and a comic Chinese fantasy.  I found the Chinese segment especially entertaining and some of the images -- such as the old magician transformed into a cactus -- are incredibly surreal and surprising 80 years after they were filmed. Interesting as the film that made Lang famous and very entertaining in its own right, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes cinema of the imagination.", "Fritz Lang's 1921 film Destiny] is reportedly based on a dream he had as a child. I can only assume that he must have immersed himself in old school narratives such as myths, folk tales, and Greek tragedy from an early age since this somewhat allegorical film immediately brings those traditions to mind. In fact, you can almost see where he picked up various parts of the plot. Fortunately, he put them together in a brilliantly unique way. This film manages to bring to mind the best traditional tales from various cultures and periods while maintaining a wonderfully fresh and inventive mood throughout.Like many of the greatest tales of yore, Destiny is about a pair of young lovers who are separated from each other suddenly. After this separation, the narrative resembles a sort of Orpheaic journey with one key reversal: in Destiny it is the female character who strives to rescue the endangered male. She is given three shots to save her beloved, each of which takes place in a different part of the world. This somewhat unusual structure allows Lang to experiment with different styles to match the traditions of each place she visits.Not only does Destiny do an excellent job with a universal (but uncomplicated) theme, it also has more than its share of memorable visuals. Although cinema's most famous personification of Death is Bergman's version from The Seventh Seal, it is surely Lang's version that most evokes the essence of the character. Indeed, I for one find this Death to be more memorable than Bergman's. Other memorable visuals include the towering wall built by Death, the candles used to represent lives, and the various spells conjured up by a Chinese magician, particularly an army of tiny men.I'm very grateful to everyone here who has recommended this film-it's truly a film like no other and an indisputable masterpiece.", "With the advent of the spoken movies one cinematographic species was forever extinguished\u0097the cinema lyrical poem; I do not intend to say that all silent movies were such lyrical poems. Far from the truth; it is plain for everyone to see that the spoken and dramatic movies, and also the genres knew their avatars during the silent era. But some of the silent movies were lyrical poems\u0097of a kind rendered impossible by the spoken cinema.Perhaps\u0097and I graciously say perhaps, yet I'm convinced of it\u0097the most noticeable feature of DMT (let's keep it German, shall we not?) is its gloomy, eerie, uncanny, funeral atmosphere. Simultaneously, the pace is quite alert, while the three vignettes referred to below are refreshingly dissimilar.Now let us see whether\u0097and to what extent\u0097we do agree. DER M\u0170DE TOD is a creepy melodrama, sometimes thrillingly beautiful, almost a great movie, certainly a good one; a young woman attempts to rescue her lover from the claws and pangs of the personified Death; which Death offers her several occasions to see human lives brutally extinct, and the director treats us with a few exotic scenes\u0097a Mohammedan tale; an Italian Renaissance one; and a Chinese one, the best vignette might be that of Monna Fiametta and Girolamo. Lil Dagover plays the dignified young woman; she once represented the glamor of the silent screen.", "Contemporary audiences must have been awed by the spectacle of the three exotic adventure episodes within `Der Mude Tod', but the imagery Fritz Lang employs in the bookends is the most fascinating aspect of the film today. Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton had already occasionally used clever camera tricks, but Fritz Lang's film revels in special effects.  Through editing and double exposure, he makes it look even now as though ghosts are disappearing through a garden wall, or that two lovers' souls are exiting their bodies.  The most exciting thing about Lang's magic, of course, is that his images act as a foundation for beautiful, poetic ideas.  His unusually sympathetic portrayal of Death is just one example of why the outer story resonates so much more than the obvious melodrama in its middle. Lang seems to argue that, while love cannot overcome death, it retains a power which even death would respect and envy.Rating: 8", "Der Mude Tod (the German title is infinitely better than the generic Destiny) consists of three short stories and a bigger overarching one that bookends the film. The first title card reading \"Some time at some place\" sets the tone somewhere between myth and fantasy and the iconic appearance of a grim, black-clad Death only confirms that. When he claims the life of a young girl's lover, she travels to his lair to plead for him. His lair, a patch of land near a graveyard hidden from a titanic wall, is like a garden of death and when a huge door opens in the previously impenetrable wall the stairs mysteriously lead upwards.Even if Fritz Lang places his Hades up, the concept of a lover pleading to Death for the life of her beloved one is Orphic through and through. Death challenges the girl, each challenge being one of the three stories. All of them are tragic tales of unrequisite love and succeed even as they retread (by now) familiar ground. The second story's ironic finale is a treat even if the logic behind it is a bit shoddy.What really makes Der Mude Tod such a fascinating piece of silent cinema is the finale. Death gives a final chance for the girl to reclaim her lover - to bring him another soul in exchange before midnight. It is then through the small encounters the desperate girl has with an old pharmacist, a mangy beggar and two nagging old nurses that the movie offers those little pieces of insight into human nature that make every great film worth watching. The moral of the case here is that no matter how old, poor, ill and down-trodden one is, life is too precious to give away. A more melodramatic director would just have someone graciously offer the girl his life. Lang instead offers us the understanding that \"life is like this!\".Der Mude Tod would have been good enough as it is but it's also a treat to look at. The sets and costumes are all quality work, expressionistic enough to be felt but not exaggerated to the point of distracting from the story. Suffice to say this is really a must-see for fans of silent cinema.", "In 1920's France was known for its impressionism, Soviet Union for its montage cinema and Germany for its expressionism. Both F.W. Murnau and Fritz Lang are usually seen as the biggest representatives of it. Murnau's Faust (1926) and Lang's Der m\u00fcde Tod have taught us year after year what is German expressionism, and I could bet that both of these films are in every film school's curriculum. Der m\u00fcde Tod is often translated as The Three Lights or Destiny, but a more accurate translation would be Tired Death. It tells the story of a young couple in love, who arrive to a small German village and soon become acquainted with Death.When researching the history of cinema it is good for one to take a perspective, from which one starts to look at the films. One perspective I myself enjoy is correspondances. The loyal partner for Lang's Der m\u00fcde Tod can be found easily; F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu (1922). They're both full of suggestive Gothic and expressionistic imagery. Both Murnau and Lang define a zone in their Gothic masterpieces. The zone in between of physic and metaphysic, life and afterlife, real and surreal. Fritz Lang was able to create poetry of imagination, which changed cinema for ever and left a permanent influence on such artists as Luis Bunuel, Jean Cocteau and Georges Franju.Der m\u00fcde Tod portrays man in front of an eternal problem which is why the common translation Destiny isn't that bad at all. Fritz Lang shows us death, which awaits us all like destiny, something which cannot be avoided. The storyline has taken a lot of influence from expressionistic theater and German folks tales; the characters have no names. The character Death is tired of earning his salary: he's tired of seeing death and agony, misery and suffering of man. The tired Death resembles a modern day bureaucrat but also a responsible hard-working man.Fritz Lang got an incredibly crew to make this film with him which is why it is often seen as his breakthrough. He was able to create the fantastic Bagdad, Venice, ancient China and timeless German village. Even that this is seen as one of the greatest examples of German expressionism, the expressionism of it is very subtle. The most suggestive images are simplified, minimalist, powerful and unforgettable; the wall and the dream-like room of different kind of candles, each of which represent one human life.In the story when Death comes and takes the Man with him the Woman is ready to do anything. Her love is so strong that she doesn't want to live without her love. Death offers her a deal at the room of candles; if she is able to save one of the three candles from fading away she will have her love back. Der m\u00fcde Tod grows out to be a beautiful study of humanity but at the same manages to be one of the most entertaining films of the era.As the Woman desperately tries to save the candles and afterwards find a life to sacrifice for Death, which would result her to get the Man back, we're able to see how Lang builds this humane tale. The Woman proves her humanity as she saves the baby from the burning building and is willing to die for another. All this makes Der m\u00fcde Tod sound like a very dark and serious film, which it is, but paradoxically it's also one of the most humorous ones by Fritz Lang. Der m\u00fcde Tod is an unforgettable masterpiece and no lesser compared to its companion Nosferatu. It's a study about the essence of humanity, filled with unforgettable expressionistic imagery.", "I am quite curious and the rainy day I choose to watch that silent movie I fell in love with Fritz Lang's visual art. The story mixes destiny (as reminded by the english title) travel across three different times and places and a tragic love story. Setting-ups and cinematography are wonderful and suspense is already on screen with that plot: a girl is given three chances to save her lovers whose death she couldn't stand. Three times destiny is stronger than her love but in the three different episodes Lang succeeds in bringing a new hope at the beginning. But as things go the face of Death appears and her presence becomes increasingly unavoidable. As pointed out in the previous comment, than embodied Death playing directly with men as been reused by Bergman in The Seventh Seal.In between the episodes, the vision of the Destinies Cathedral with its vacillating flames stands for what Fritz Lang was able to simply with images. Unfortunately his talking movies were visually less impressive (except the german ones of course: M and Testament of Dr Mabuse). In comparison Hitchcock did not make movies with great cinematography before Rebecca. And I think he only reaches Lang's outstanding visual level in Vertigo. On the other hand Lang suffered for he could only express a limited part of his visual skills in the US.", "If I was a college film professor, I would definitely choose this to represent the silent era, particularly the German influence on the motion picture industry, especially with its stunning remastered print. The film was not available for viewing when I was in film school, so instead our silent movie viewing consisted of \"Intolerance\", \"Seven Chances\" and \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", certainly all worthy of study. But even with my limited viewing silent films as of this writing, I have to say that this one will go neat the top not only as one of the best silent films ever made, but one of the best motion pictures ever made period.Even if Fritz Lang had only directed this film and no others, he would still be remembered in cinematic history for creating a masterpiece. The expressionalism starts off immediately with a view of a mysterious figure that can only be described as something other worldly. Bernhard Goetzke is certainly not an unattractive figure of a destiny that people don't want to face before their time, and it's obvious like Bela Lugosi's Dracula that his aura is completely seductive even if the feeling of danger lurks there. For heroine Lil Dagover however, that's not enough. She wants to be reunited with with all her soul whom Goetzke had taken.To be reunited with her beloved Walter Janssen, Dagover must go back to three ages to prevent death from happening there. Old Mecca, renaissance Italy and a wild Japan have the three leads playing other characters, and in spite of some I raising stereotypes, these visuals are stunning and unforgettable. My only issue with this movie is with the newly created subtitles in a font that is difficult to read quickly and often going off the screen before the viewer is done. Other than that, I was absolutely mesmerized. The visuals with some great special effects are amazing, and the theme of love conquering death remains quite timely. I have given films the highest rating possible that I wouldn't call absolutely perfection, but this is certainly a film that ranks as one of the few.", "(Flash Review)The grim reaper ain't no joke. He is a formidable foe and is hard to be sweet talked or sympathized with. The story is sparked by a woman's husband disappearing after encountering the grim reaper at an inn. Distraught, the woman later pleads with Death to give her back her husband. Not totally shot down, Death gives her a unique opportunity. What opportunity is it? Will she see her husband again in the living world as we know it? This is a well-shot and creative film that has bold effects and excellent cinematography. The opportunity will take place across the globe so there are neat cultural sets and locations. Overall, it was a clever story, not gruesome, had top notch special effects for the period and held your attention for the duration.", "When a woman's fianc\u00e9 disappears, Death gives her three chances to save him from his fate.This is the sort of movie that made an impact in its own time. Douglas Fairbanks purchased the American rights, to delay its general American release while he copied the effects of the Persian segment for his 1924 \"The Thief of Baghdad\". Luis Bunuel has said this is the film that got him interested in movies, and apparently Alfred Hitchcock has praised it as well.I would not praise it quite on the level either of them did. It is not Fritz Lang's best film by a long shot, nor the best film of the German Expressionist era. But still worth seeing, if for no other reason than it is a Lang film, and stars Lil Dagover, arguably the greatest actress of the Weimar period.", "This was an early film of Fritz Lang--before he made his incredibly famous silent METROPOLIS. However, despite being a younger and less experienced director, this film shows a real deftness and I enjoyed it quite a bit.This viewing experience was helped quite a bit by a nice musical score--something that not all silents come with on DVD. As musical scores were almost never written specifically for films, many DVDs have scores that often don't match up well with the films--this is certainly NOT the case with this lovely film.The story is an allegory about death and it reminded me, in part, of Bergman's films \"The Seventh Seal\", as both films concerned a person trying to make a bargain with the Angel of Death--to somehow get a second chance. \"Der M\u00fcde Tod\" is a bit different because this time it is not the fated to die who tries to make the bargain but his new wife--who can't stand the idea of losing him right after the wedding.Unfortunately, the middle portion of the film is a bit of a drag. While all three segments were well made, they weren't at all necessary to the plot. All three stories were apparently told by Death to illustrate that ones fate cannot be overcome--even by love. All this tended to do, though, was slow down the film. The first and last portions (which dealt with the Angel and the new bride) were exceptional--and just didn't need the three stories. In many ways, this style of filming was a copy of D. W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\"--as the three stories are meant to illustrate the premise.Fortunately, when these three irrelevant stories are complete, the film jumps back into gear. The Angel tells the lady he is willing to return her husband IF she is able to find someone to take his place in the afterlife. She asks around and naturally no one wants to die. Later, when she comes upon the child in the fire, this leads to a terrific ending--one that really helps the movie to end on an excellent note.Exceptionally beautiful throughout and compelling, this is a silent film worth seeing.", "My discovery of Fritz Lang's cinema continues to take me to wonderful places. After enjoying his Mabuse movies and the seminal thriller M, I take a look at one of his earliest silent movies: Destiny.Written between Lang his frequent collaborator, Thea Von Harbou, Destiny is an anthology fantasy movie comprised of three stories and bookended by a game between Death and a woman trying to bring her dead lover back to life. The movie begins as a newlywed couple stops at an inn. On the way an austere man dressed up in black gets on their coach. The woman leaves the table for an instant and when she returns, the husband and the stranger are gone. She looks for them and discovers her husband's spirit wandering outside the walls of a giant precinct Death erected to make a garden, presumably of souls.Death is so amazed by her devotion, that he proposes a challenge: he gives her the chance to save one life about to perish; she has three chances and needs only save one. If she does, Death will return her lover to him.This is an artifice to tell three wonderful and fantasy-laden stories in different settings: there's one in Persia, one in Venice, and one in ancient China. All are variations on the same themes - love and the inevitability of death.What most impressed me in this movie were the art direction and costume design of the different stories. They were epic: imagine thousands of extras, flamboyant designs, huge sets. It's like watching a D.W. Griffith movie at times. One of the most impressive sets was the interior of Death's room, an endless space cluttered with burning candles, each representing a soul burning itself out.Next was the imagination of the stories. In particular there's the last story, set in China, that has many wondrous elements, like flying carpets, flying horses, a miniature army, and many magic spells transforming people into objects and bringing objects into life. This story alone has influenced movies such as Douglas Fairbanks' The Thief of Bagdad and The Adventures of Prince Achmed.Then there's the premise underlying the story: that death is irreversible. The movie has a touch of sentimentality, since it shows the lovers reuniting in death, but the movie shows death is not something that can be bargained with. It's a fact that must be accepted.Fans of Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal will want to watch this movie to compare Bernhard Goetzke's portrayal of Death with Bengt Ekerot's. Lang and Bergman didn't see Death the same way: Lang's Death is a cursed soul, weary of its own existence, whereas Bergman's is cynical, scheming and perhaps has a certain taste in its job.I was amazed at how easily I immersed myself in this movie. I was afraid I'd have no interest in this movie, being a silent movie, but Lang's direction is so good and modern I was in thrall most of the time. I'm glad I watched this movie, it's a part of film history that should never be forgotten.", "I wonder what he is today, almost a 100 years later. \"Destiny\" is a silent movie by famous German director Fritz Lang and it runs for 100 minutes, at least the version I watched. Lang gut help with the script once again by Thea von Harbou, with whom he worked together on a regular basis. This was a very early project of the two, considerably before \"M\" and \"Metropolis\". Both were around 30 years of age at this point. The story is as follows. Two people are madly in love, but sadly for the guy the time has come and Death takes him on his last journey. The woman will not accept it and begs Death until he finally gives in and giver he the chance to win his beloved back. People about to die are symbolized by candles who are about to go out. Death shows her 3 candles who are about to go out soon and tells her that if she can keep one of these from going out, then she will get her beloved back. But this is where the contradictions start. If a man's time has come, then there is no way in keeping him from dying. Death said so himself earlier in the film. So is he just toying with her?Maybe, as the woman does not manage to save a single one of these three souls. So, she gets another chance... I always think of Death as a relentless character and I just cannot understand how he shows mercy so many times in this film that he would even give her another chance at the end. I quite liked the core action here. I only wondered why they would introduce all the townsfolk in the pub early on if they don't play a role at all later as the film progresses. But it wasn't bad and the actual idea of those 3 challenges is a decent one too. However, it hurts in terms of predictability. It was so clear that she would at least fail the first two, so this was basically half an hour wasted and we knew the outcome anyway. Apart from that, I did not like these 3 sequences anyway. Putting her in completely different regions of the world was a nice idea, but everything that happened during these 3 parts was just so uninteresting and I never really felt for her and prayed that she would manage to save the guy. The ending wasn't bad either. I read the core plot afterward, but this film was just so confusing at times that it was really difficult to understand what exactly was going on. I would definitely prefer it as a book version and I am not even a great reader. Then again, I am not the greatest silent movie fan either. Giving this one a chance does not change my perception that the genre is generally not too interesting and certainly not my cup of tea. Dagover did not impress me really here, but the actor who played Death was pretty good. I recommend \"Destiny\" only to silent film lovers. Everybody else will not enjoy it.", "This should be a lesson to the movie makers of today who have at their disposal a range of special effects other directors never had, but they use them for moronic ideas. Der Mude Tod is amazing not for its camera tricks (such as double exposure) or for their filters that give the image a certain tint to make it more revealing, but for the brilliant use of these techniques in order to achieve an aesthetic ideal. German expressionism started to fascinate me after seeing The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, and then I went on to see some other movies that are loosely gathered under this label. Der mude Tod may not be as spectacular as Metrtopolis but it has the power to work on many levels as well. It's hard to place this in a genre, the IMDb thought it a fantasy but it is clearly more, it's romance, drama, and even a thriller in some moments. The story is a perfect example of the expressive possibilities of cinema, as the lead characters are used in three different stories connected in a larger fourth story. Just like Dr. Caligari there's more than meets the eye with the movie even if it does get a bit childish sometimes. Speaking of which, I think that the sets are constructed as if from the imagination of a child, they are definitely not \"historically accurate\". This goes to show you that producers today waste their money on accuracy leaving aside storytelling and good film making. And this is for the worst. And speaking of producers it is really a pity that when he came in America Lang made all those noirs and westerns. Some of them are good, because the direction is generally well done, but I think Lang could have used his talents on better scripts.", "This early Fritz Lang picture made quite a splash among his fellow filmmakers. Hitchcock's favourite film, catalyst for Luis Bunuel's career, inspiration for many of the devices in the Douglas Fairbanks Thief of Bagdad and even one or two ideas in Powell and Pressburger's Tales of Hoffman, Der Mude Tod certainly has a lot to answer for.This was also Lang's first collaboration with wife-to-be Thea von Harbou. The influence of a more talented screenwriter is clear, as this boasts a far stronger narrative than his earlier Spiders pictures, which he penned himself. The main storyline was famously inspired by a dream that Lang once had. I've lost track of the number of times I've woken up from a dream, thinking it was a fantastic idea for a screenplay, only to realise once I was properly awake it was unworkable. Lang and Harbou have done a good job then of weaving a fairly coherent story out of what is after all the product of someone's unconscious mind. And yet there are a number of weaknesses to it. For example, why is it necessary to introduce us individually to all the town's notaries, when their identities are of so little importance to the plot? This is at the expense of the principle characters, none of whom is fully rounded.However, while Lang often failed to balance out a story, he had a real sense of structure when it came imagery and tone. Here was a director who truly thought in images and not words. If you look at Lang's greatest silent pictures, especially Metropolis, they are structured \u2013 often literally \u2013 like works of classical music, with calm passages giving way to more dynamic movements. You can see the beginnings of that trend here \u2013 the framing story in the German town is slow and appropriately dreamlike in its imagery. Then there is a sudden contrast with the burst of action that opens the story of the first light, and this frantic pace is kept up throughout the first and second stories. For this reason the third story, for all its special effects, is the weakest for me because it loses the pace of the first two and is the least tight in its construction.The individual image was also highly important to Lang. Whereas his contemporaries in German cinema were doing everything with shadows and superimpositions, Lang often achieves greater effect with his manipulation of space. He had already experimented with scenery and space in his earliest films, but by now a very definite approach is beginning to emerge. Lang often likes show us a scene from two opposing camera angles, showing us the completeness of a set and making it feel real to the audience. He is not afraid to break the line of action \u2013 switching the camera from one side of the actors to the other - generally a directorial no-no, but to be honest it only causes confusion when everything is shown in close-ups and the space where the action takes place is not well defined. In Der Mude Tod, as with many of Lang's films, every shot seems calculated to suggest enclosure and entrapment \u2013 very apt for the theme of inescapable fate. On small sets, rear walls are often at 45-degree angles to the camera, so they appear to hem in the actors, while on the larger sets the sheer cavernous size of the room makes the actors appear tiny. Even in the outdoor scenes the action is often framed by an overhanging tree.In spite of his constant attention to the architecture, Lang is now paying a bit more attention to his actors. The performances are comparatively restrained for a German silent film, with Lil Dagover resisting the temptation to slip into melodrama, and the always watchable Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the most normal, human role I have ever seen him in.In Der Mude Tod, we see the first flourishing of Fritz Lang's genius. He is just a few films away from perfecting his technique. Still, the picture suffers somewhat from the same problem as many \"effects movies\", in that it is an impressive show without enough substance to back it up \u2013 in this case the main defect is a lack of well-defined characters."], "tt0012545": [], "tt0012949": ["Pity!, that A BLIND BARGAIN is a lost film. A text reconstruction was published in 1988 by Philip Riley with help from legendary horror aficionado Forrest Ackerman. Their book uses a multitude of still pictures that survived from the production and at least arranges the story in a manner that is close to the shooting schedule. This book is a similar reconstruction that Riley & Ackerman did with the lost London AFTER MIDNIGHT(1927).ABB is one of the few Lon Chaney Sr movies/stories that can be classified as horror in the 'supernatural' sense that we know it today. His horror reputation has come down through the years due to fantastic makeups in films like Phantom of the Opera, Hunchback of Notre Dame & London After Midnight. All great make-ups. But most of Chaney's classic silent movies centered around deformed people, emphasized make-ups or criminal melodrama. At the time this was very groundbreaking stuff in movies and bad behavior and criminal machinations was considered horrific enough to most adult movie goers who had been raised in the 19th century. Supernatural horror had only been explored in movies sporadically in primitive 1-2 reel versions of Frankenstein & Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde. ABB, judging from Riley's synopsis is about a scientist, Dr Lamb(Chaney Sr), who experiments in his lab blending human & simian aspects into his nimble assistant(also Chaney Sr in dual roles). From what one can decipher of where the story goes, the simian experiments using the assistant go awry and out-of-control. From here the story starts to look familiar to the Dr Jekyll story and it also curiously has a bit in common with Lon Chaney Jr's THE WOLFMAN made 20 years later. Riley's book has some very good stills of Chaney Sr during the course of production on ABB and some fascinating shots of Chaney Sr in various stages of makeup showing the human-on-the-way-to-simian stages of the haywire experiments. Like Dr Jekyll & Frankenstein & Wolfman & The Fly this shows a human blending into something other than human giving credence to the supernatural. THE Vampire in London AFTER MIDNIGHT was a faux paux, meaning he was not a real vampire, he was used by a very human & crafty detective to leaven a story thus rendering him non-supernatural. Chaney's makeup as the vampire is very horrific and has erroneously been linked to supernatural by some. The experiments in ABB are quite of the supernatural as we expect them today.This was the third or fourth time Lon Chaney Sr worked with his friend director Wallace Worsley. They had made the excellent THE PENALTY in 1920 and were a year away from making HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME(actually begun in 1922). Personally I don't think Worsley was good at directing big super productions like HUNCHBACK but he was excellent at smaller more intimate Chaney pictures like THE PENALTY, ACE OF HEARTS & VOICES OF THE CITY. The great cinematographer, Norbert Brodine, was a young up-and-coming cameraman then and ABB is one of his earliest assignments working with Chaney & Worsley. Towards the end of his life Brodine provided some insight into the making of this movie by reminiscing about the production. Hopefully a copy of ABB will resurface somewhere, in some country. Keep those fingers crossed."], "tt0013223": ["For those of us who live in Tarrytown, New York, a town whose northern neighbor is called Sleepy Hollow, Washington Irving's tale of Ichabod Crane and his encounter with the Headless Horseman is never far from our consciousness. Irving lived here, wrote here and set many of his stories in the area. The image of the Horseman is used in logos for a number of local businesses, and the souvenir shops are chock-a-block with Sleepy Hollow memorabilia, especially since Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' came out a couple of years ago. The Horseman has decidedly edged out Rip Van Winkle as Irving's best remembered tale, or at least his most heavily commercialized one. The Disney studio produced a terrific Headless Horseman cartoon in the late '40s, by far the best screen adaptation to date, but when it comes to live action the tale doesn't seem to lend itself readily to the cinema, and this silent feature film starring Will Rogers demonstrates why.The Oklahoma-born Rogers was a most likable screen figure, and on a purely visual level his offbeat casting as Yankee schoolmaster Ichabod Crane works surprisingly well, though he couldn't have played an Easterner convincingly in a talkie. (Although come to think of it, Will did just that in the 1931 version of Twain's Connecticut Yankee; perhaps his casting in that case was something of an inside joke). But anyone expecting a comic rendition of this story featuring Rogers' characteristic wit will be disappointed, for the filmmakers followed Washington Irving's story all too faithfully, giving us an Ichabod Crane who is deeply unsympathetic. We expect comedy when we first see Will dressed as Ichabod, looking so gawky in his 18th century clothes and funny little pigtail, but Rogers plays it straight; his Ichabod is a pompous nerd, just as the story dictates. When the schoolroom sequence begins we expect Our Gang-style gags with pea-shooters or something similar, but this Yankee schoolmaster is self-righteous, prissy and stern. When a boy makes a sassy comment about the local flirt, Ichabod beats him briskly. What humor there is comes from the title cards, generally at Ichabod's expense, as he makes one foolish, arrogant remark after another.All of this serves the story Washington Irving wrote, but it doesn't serve our nominal star, Will Rogers, or the demands of entertaining cinema. We don't like our \"hero\" Ichabod Crane very much, in fact he comes off as a jerk: the title cards make it explicitly clear that his courtship of local belle Katrina Van Tassel is driven by greed for her money and property. What a guy! So if we don't like the leading man, who else is there? We are told, again by one of those convenient title cards, that Ichabod's rival Brom Bones isn't such a bad sort, but the next thing we know, Brom is enjoying a cockfight with great enthusiasm -- and shortly afterward, inflamed by jealousy over Katrina, he attempts to use fake evidence to establish that Ichabod is in league with the devil, and nearly gets the guy tarred and feathered by local hotheads. So much for Brom Bones. And as for Katrina, she prefers Brom.So, we've got a story with absolutely no one to root for, where even the charismatic Will Rogers comes off as a greedy, conceited little schnook, in a town full of rubes, dupes, and superstitious fools. (I should add that where my fellow citizens are concerned, to paraphrase Monty Python, \"We got better.\") This adaptation of The Headless Horseman does have nice period detail and some amusing touches along the way, and the climactic chase is well-handled and stirring. In sum, however, this film suggests that Irving's Legend of Sleepy Hollow is inherently off-putting material for a live action feature film, and it did so long before Tim Burton proved the point, once and for all.", "This adaptation of the Washington Irving story is watchable, and it has some good moments, but that's the best you can say about it. It makes you feel as if somewhere it missed the opportunity to be a little better. While it tells the story in a clear and capable fashion, that's about all it does. There is never really a distinctive atmosphere or any sustained tension, and there are only a few brief moments of comic relief, despite ample opportunities for any or all of these.It seems a bit of a shame to have the thoroughly likable Will Rogers portray a smug and rather petty character like Ichabod Crane. Rogers does a satisfactory job, but he is limited by what the role has to offer. The other characters likewise are believable, and are recognizable from the story, but it needed some atmosphere or creative touches to make the characters and the situation more compelling.It's probably still worth seeing for silent movie fans. The climactic sequence - which offers material much more cinematic in nature than the rest of the narrative - is done well, and it allows the movie to end with some energy.", "Can't think of an awful lot to recommend this picture to any viewers, except that you can see a youthful Will Rogers perform. This being a silent movie, you can't hear his voice or any of his folksy aphorisms. So, we are left with his image and his pantomime ability, and it's not enough to satisfy.Thanks to the Disney studio, this Washington Irving story has already been brought to life on the silver screen, and to much better effect. The cartoon had some humor, some suspense, some rooting interest, some more definition in the characterizations. The cartoon, in short, was more interesting. (Didn't see the Tim Burton feature).This picture is about a group of mean-spirited, shabbily-dressed locals unattractively photographed and who seem to wander about without definite purpose. Nothing of great import happens, and day for night is used for the climactic sequence involving Ichabod Crane's confrontation with the Headless Horseman - the opposite of scary. This picture was filmed on the Rockefeller Estate in Pocantico Hils (Tarrytown), N.Y. It still exists today and in comparatively pristine condition as depicted in the movie. This, and the appearance of Rogers, may be the only reasons to watch this dull affair.", "This is an early telling of \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and runs 71 minutes. Considering that this film starred Will Rogers, I had very high hopes for this silent picture and assumed it would be a comedy. However, I soon noticed that the print was extremely horrible and often difficult to watch. Then I noticed that although Rogers was very talented and funny, in this film he was about as funny as Walter Cronkite. And then I noticed that I kept falling asleep during the film--strike three! The bottom line is that although this is a relatively faithful retelling of the Washington Irving short story, there just isn't any life in it. Plus, given that practically every viewer knows what happens at the end, there isn't any suspense either. It's watchable and interesting to note that they actually filmed it in Upstate New York, but that's really about it.Sadly, the film is bundled another silent,THE MECHANICAL MAN, on DVD. This Italian film manages to be even less interesting or entertaining that THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN and so I strongly caution all sane people from buying this DVD. Fortunately I got it from Netflix--otherwise, I'd be feeling pretty angry now!", "Headless Horseman, The (1922)* 1/2 (out of 4)Pretty poor version of Washington Irving's tale. Will Rogers plays the school teacher who travels to Sleepy Hollow only to discover the mysterious headless horseman. For some reason this film pays more attention to the teacher and his personal affairs rather than the headless horseman and the legend surrounding him. The movie only runs 76-minutes but it feels like a couple of hours. The story is all over the map without too many of anything actually going on. The miscasting of Rogers hurts the film as well, although the special effects and sets are good.", "Today's viewers of early silent movies might think that actors-and especially actresses-all applied a thick application of lipstick and eye-liner since those areas were so dark. And the skin tones looked like they never had been in the sun, so pale were their faces. The real truth is the film stock used in early movies was orthochromatic, invented in 1873 for still photography, and is still used by photographers today for landscape and some portrait photos.Technically, orthochromatic consists of silver halide crystals, which are sensitive to the color blue. One can notice movies in the late 1800's and early 1900's where daylight scenes have white skies on a cloudless day. In close-up shots, actors with blue eyes appeared to have nearly white eyeballs. In addition, orthochromatic film can't detect red light; it converts reds simply to black. So actresses appeared to wear black lipstick even though on the set they wore red.A German chemist, Herman Vogel, tinkered with several ingredients knowing the weaknesses of orthochromatic film. Others built on Vogel's work, inventing in 1906 the panchromatic process for still photography. By 1913 Eastman Kodak, the supplier of motion picture film stock, was able to introduce the advanced process to flexible celluloid, but it was high unstable and expensive. Finally in 1922, Kodak's panchromatic film quality was much improved and the cost to manufacture it dramatically dropped.The first movie to be entirely shot using panchromatic film was November 1922's \"The Headless Horseman.\" It may appear the new process didn't make much difference since the surviving prints of \"The Headless Horseman\" are worn and washed out. This was a major problem with early panchromatic motion picture film since it had such a short shelf-life. By 1926, more refinements in stability were introduced. With an extended preservation of its sharpness and depth of visual tones, panchromatic became the movie industry standard, forcing Kodak to discontinue orthochromatic movie film stock by 1930.Showman Will Rogers headlined \"The Headless Horseman,\" appearing as the stern teacher, Ichabod Crane. The movie is the earliest surviving film version based on the Washington Irving's short story. Rogers went against his normal friendly and homespun persona by acting as the harsh, rigid school taskmaster. His character didn't quite mesh with the small Sleepy Hollow, New York, villagers, who were about to railroad Crane out of town.Rogers was in his fifth year in cinema when he appeared in \"The Headless Horsemen.\" Samuel Goldwyn had signed the Broadway star to a multi-year contract in 1918 to appear in silent movies, an unusual move since the Oklahoma-born performer was known more for his verbal witticisms rather than his pantomiming. A 10th-grade high school drop-out who had spent time learning the ranch ropes in Argentina and in South Africa, began performing tricks with his lassos. Catching on to vaudeville circuits in the United States beginning in 1905, he became popular performing his horse and pony stunts. Ten years later, as a performer for Florenz Ziegfeld's 'Midnight Frolic,' in New York City, he mixed his lasso tricks with chitchat about the days' events gleaned from the daily newspapers. \"All I know is what I read in the paper\" became Rogers' trademark opening line.His real personality, despite appearing in 48 silent films, wasn't fully appreciated until the advent of talkies in 1929, where he was able to express himself verbally.", "This was a movie that I originally picked up after seeing and enjoying Sleepy Hollow. I was familiar enough with the source material, having read it when I was in junior high. It isn't necessarily on the level of H. P. Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe when it comes to the classics, but most everyone knows of the story of the Headless Horseman and Ichabod Crane. For this version, our synopsis is the village of Sleepy Hollow is getting ready to greet the new schoolteacher, Ichabod Crane (Will Rogers), who is coming from New York. As he tries to get ingrained in his new village, not everyone likes the new teacher.Much like the synopsis states, we start this movie with the village of Sleepy Hollow preparing to greet Ichabod. He is a man of science, but he also has knowledge of ghosts and other supernatural things. This makes him quite familiar with the legend of the Headless Horseman. Upon arriving, he is greeted by a welcome committee. It is most of the higher ups of this village, which includes Baltus Van Tassel (Bernard A. Reinold). He is the richest farmer in the area. His daughter is also the most desirable bachelorette. Her name is Katrina (Lois Meredith) Abraham Van Brunt, who is also known as Brom Bones (Ben Hendricks Jr.), has his eyes set on her and is jealous when she seems interested in Ichabod.He goes about teaching the children, but he upsets Dame Martling (Mary Foy). Her son is Jethro (James Sheridan) and he's a troublemaker in school. To get back at Ichabod, she tries to find ways to punish him and get him run out of town. Brom Bones helps here as him and his friends tear up the school. Ichabod believes it to be witches. Jethro relays what happens and she sees a way to get the elders of the village to turn on him.Before ending this fleshing out of the story, Katrina is interested in Ichabod. He must work up the courage to share his feelings. He also won't be easily run out of town. Part of this is having no money, but there is also his pride. An encounter with the Headless Horseman could change things though.Now I'll be honest, the version of this I watched ran about 75 minutes or so. There isn't a lot to this story if I'm honest. It has been so long since I've read the source material that I'm not sure about the characters outside of Ichabod and the Headless Horseman. I'm inclined to think that the Van Tassels, Van Brunts, Van Rippers and Martlings are all there. This is in the era of filmmaking where you'd take an established story and adapt it to the screen. This movie does well in presenting the characters and even a bit of the mythology here.This last bit is what makes this story interesting, the mythology. The Headless Horseman is an intriguing character. It is thought to be believed that he was a soldier, who lost his head and at night searches for it. There are stories shared from different townsfolk about the entity. Some claiming that the Headless Horseman wanted to race them. We get a character one night that wakes up thinking she hears the horseman. Her husband quiets her fears informing her that it is just Brom Bones and his crew. We get a cool ghostly effect to see the horseman early in the movie. The problem is that we don't see him again until the end. What I wanted was more of this like we get in the movie Sleepy Hollow. This isn't that type of movie and I also don't think they had resources to show it more. I like the effect that is used that first time. I'm not a fan of the reveal at the end of the movie though. Since this movie is part comedy, I think we're trying to play it for laughs.That will take me over to an issue I have here, this movie is boring despite its low runtime. I think its due to what they focus on. Rogers is good as Ichabod and I even like the arrogance he plays the role with. Meredith works Katrina. We don't flesh her out all that much, but we can tell she has a crush on Ichabod. She is in a tough position with Brom Bones interested in her. I even think Hendricks is solid as that character. The problem is that we focus too much on them when we don't need it. The movie bogs down because of it. I also wanted to give credit to Foy, Sheridan and the rest of the acting as it all works. It is over the top being that this is a silent film so they needed to play it that way.There's not much else that I can talk about with this movie. I think that the cinematography is good for the era. We are early into cinema, so it is static and we don't get much in the way of cuts. I like what they did with the introduction to the Headless Horseman. The costumes do make it feel of the era it is set. The only other aspect would be the soundtrack. This can get dicey as I'm entirely sure what should be synced up. What we get though is good. It adds atmosphere to the movie. We get the same songs played over and over, but it doesn't ruin it.In conclusion then, this is decent take on the source material for early cinema. This is an era where they would base many movies off established works. I like Ichabod and Rogers does well in portraying the character. The lore of the Headless Horseman is good, but I wanted more there. This movie has a tinge of comedy that didn't necessarily work for me. I would say that the acting worked and how this was shot was in line with the era. There are movies from the same period that did more there and even with the effects. Other than that, I'd say the soundtrack my version had fit and helped with the atmosphere. I believe this is above average. It is just lacking some parts to go higher for me.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.", "Merely adequate retelling of the famous story. Its chief interest lies in the location filming in New York's Hudson River Valley, including the actual Old Dutch Church in Sleepy Hollow. The screenplay introduces a non-Irving subplot of Ichabod Crane being accused of witchcraft in a prank by Brom Bones. None of the comic scenes are particularly funny; one can imagine what Buster Keaton might have done as Ichabod. Some attempts are made at pictorialism, aided by the panchromatic film used here. But the valley's autumnal colors described by Washington Irving are sadly missing in black and white. And the day-for-night scenes of the climactic chase look like pure daylight without the deep blue tinting undoubtedly used in original prints.", "I always liked the Disney version of this story and since I like Will Rogers and I find it fascinating to see silent versions of more modern films I like, I made my way into the screening room at Cinevent 2012.Our star, Will Rogers, is best known for his wit, which cannot be on display here because it is a silent. Strike one. The buildup to the reason to watch the movie, the headless horseman, was so long and dull, that I found myself nodding off several times, as were many of the people around me. Strike two. The climax came much too late and suddenly to justify watching this movie. Strike three.The runtime on this movie is a little more than an hour, but it feels like triple that. It is painful to watch.", "This is not a great film. It is very slow. The book was very scary. The 1999 film Sleep Hollow based on the same book Legend of sleepy hollow by Washington Irving. The short cartoon the Legend of sleepy hollow is very entertaining. This is badly written. It is also badly acted. There try to makes short story into a long movie. By adding stuff that just for the sake of making it long. So they could make a full length movie. They did not capture the fear of the book. The book is one of the scariest stories ever. And this is just boring and slow. It is not scary at all. There should have made it a short film then it might have been fun. Instead of being just boring.", "I'm a sucker for this story but this version lacks what it takes to hold someone's interest for very long. They are missing atmosphere! There is no real imagery - not Gothic, not ghostly, nor ghoulish - and this is a ghost story! The main focus here is on the Ichabod, Tassel and Brom Bones triangle -- forget the ghastly horseman, he's not really here.They seem to be relying on the comedy 100% and forgetting the horror aspect of the story - and it's the Headless Horseman that is the big draw here - not this \"romance\" triangle. Need more of the ghostly scaring towards Crane, the rivalry of Bones and Crane.2/10", "This is perhaps the most boring movie I ever seen. It was difficult to sit though because the story took so long to get to the point of seeing the headless horseman that you begin forgetting what the point of the story is."], "tt0013257": ["The striking visuals would in themselves be sufficient reason to watch \"H\u00e4xan\", but in addition it is a thought-provoking feature that combines dark humor, some occasional chilling moments, and perceptive commentary on human nature. It's an unusual package and an unusual feature, and there aren't many films quite like it.Simply on the surface, the series of unusual visuals and believable recreations of bygone eras would make for interesting viewing. Benjamin Christensen added a strong dose of the macabre to practically every scene, even in some of the smaller details that are only noticeable upon repeat viewings. Some of it is fascinating, some of it unsettling, all of it interesting.But there is much more to \"H\u00e4xan\" than a mere collection of grotesque images and vignettes. Towards the end, in particular, the commentary becomes quite pointed. It is quite easy for anyone - film-maker, writer, commentator - to criticize and condemn the beliefs and practices of the Middle Ages or of any other long past era. But it is far more of a challenge to, as Christensen has done here, point out the sometimes devastating parallels to one's own era. It is always such a comforting fiction to believe that we are so much more enlightened than past generations have been, and yet it is rarely if ever true.Christensen aptly illustrates the point that the inability to deal with the odd, the eccentric, and the unusual in our fellow beings is a perennial failing of humanity. Each generation simply devises its own means of stigmatizing and punishing those who cannot conform. (Nor is our own generation markedly better than was Christensen's.) This feature can certainly be viewed (either in the original silent version, or in the 1960s version with some spoken narration) for entertainment value alone. But it is even more pertinent in its observations on human nature. It's an often unsettling movie, with some images that might be bit too uncomfortable for some viewers. But for all that, it's an unusual and worthwhile viewing experience.", "The writer and director Benjamin Christensen discloses a historical view of the witches through the seven parts of this silent movie.In the beginning, there is a slide-show alternating intertitles with drawings and paintings to illustrate the explanations of the behavior of pagan cultures and in the Middle Ages regarding their vision of demons and witches.Then there is a dramatization of the situation of the witches in the Middle Ages, with the witchcraft and the witch-hunts.Finally Benjamin Christensen compares the behavior of hysteria of the modern women of 1921 with the behavior of the witches in the Middle Ages, concluding that they are very similar.\"H\u00e4xan\" is incredibly perfect for a for a 1922 movie. Like in a thesis, he exposes his point of view based in his study of the theme along the time. The reconstitution of the witches in the Middle Ages is amazing. The last part with the comparison with the hysteric women is funny in 2010, but it was the reality in 1921. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"H\u00e4xan - A Feiti\u00e7aria Atrav\u00e9s dos Tempos\" (\"H\u00e4xan - The Witchcraft Through the Time\")Note: On 16 Aug 2018 I saw this film again.", "After many tribulations and false starts (including having my Order cancelled by the retailer due to lack of funds on my Credit Card and having the DVD stolen - by some stingy customs official, I presume \u0096 when it was finally shipped!), I recently managed to sit down and watch in its entirety, The Criterion Collection's DVD of Benjamin Christensen's HAXAN.What an amazing film! What a fabulous disc! Apart from featuring a beautifully restored, tinted version of the original, full-length semi-documentary and its 1967 'revamping' for US audiences (redundant perhaps, but it is still nice to be able to compare the images in black and white), it also contains one of the best Audio Commentaries I have ever listened to. It is the work of Casper Tybjerg who also recorded an equally impressive one for the Criterion DVD of Carl Theodor Dreyer's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC.I think it is opportune that I mention the Dreyer film at this point because there are undeniable similarities between Christensen's film (released in 1922) and Dreyer's 'symphony of faces' (from 1928) and also his DAY OF WRATH (1943). HAXAN features two lengthy interrogation scenes involving devious clergymen and an old crone accused of witchcraft, which accusations turn out to have been true (as in DAY OF WRATH) and another one where an innocent waif is trapped into admitting her guilt (as in THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC). This is not to say that Dreyer 'lifted' these passages from Christensen's film \u0096 actually Dreyer is one of my favorite film directors and I consider THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC to be one of the greatest films ever made \u0096 but rather that he admired his work enough to pay homage to him in his later films. HAXAN also features an extensive use of close ups in its interrogation scenes, which were of course the hallmark of Dreyer's entire Joan of Arc film. Its influence may also be traced to the narrative structure of Luis Bunuel's anarchic classic of surrealism, L'AGE D'OR (1930), which testifies that Benjamin Christensen is a major artist, one who was held in high esteem by his peers in his day, but whose work was subsequently unjustly forgotten and vastly under-appreciated, due in part to its utter unavailability for serious evaluation.HAXAN contains several incredible sequences depicting devil worship in a very vivid manner which still retain their power to shock today eighty years later. I do not know how Christensen was allowed to get away with it back then \u0096 and indeed the film was heavily censored in its initial showings around the world \u0096 but I guess it was evident that the director's aim was not to wallow gratuitously in sensationalism but to portray as realistic a tableau of witchcraft through the ages as was possible at the time. There are some scenes which make you wince once in a while (like the slaughter of the child with blood pouring down its legs into a chalice beneath it), but there is enough going on visually to take your mind off its undercurrent of gore and depravity. One cannot underestimate the fact that without HAXAN there would probably never have been such horror film touchstones like Rex Ingram's THE MAGICIAN (1926), Edgar G. Ulmer's THE BLACK CAT (1934), Jacques Tourneur's NIGHT OF THE DEMON (1957), Mario Bava's BLACK Sunday (1960), John Moxey's THE CITY OF THE DEAD (1960), Sidney Hayers' NIGHT OF THE EAGLE (1961), Terence Fisher's THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (1968), Roman Polanski's ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968), Michael Reeves' WITCHFINDER GENERAL (1968), William Friedkin's THE EXORCIST (1973), Robin Hardy's THE WICKER MAN (1973), Richard Donner's THE OMEN (1976) and Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA (1976), all of which deal with diabolism or pagan worship.It should be noted that Christensen himself gives a memorable performance as Satan, joyfully seducing a wife in bed next to her sleeping husband and gleefully terrorizing a priest during a moment of weakness. Unfortunately, HAXAN is the only film directed by Benjamin Christensen which is widely available today. But, if it is anything to go by, Casper Tybjerg's evaluation of the two movies which he directed prior to HAXAN, namely THE MYSTERIOUS X (1913; aka: ORDERS UNDER SEAL) and BLIND JUSTICE (1916) should dispel the myth that D.W. Griffith claimed the mantle of the first great film director when he made THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915), although the latter was certainly the first great American film-maker. However the recent apparition of two major Louis Feuillade works, FANTOMAS (1913-14; on a superb two-disc Limited Edition DVD on Region 2) and LES VAMPIRES (1915-16; released by Water Bearer Films through Image Entertainment on Region 1) should go a long way in redressing the facts and giving this unsung, barely remembered master his due. Maybe one day, we will be just as lucky in being provided with the opportunity of evaluating on DVD Benjamin Christensen's work prior to and after HAXAN. At any rate, THE DEVIL'S CIRCUS (1926; with Norma Shearer), MOCKERY (1927; with Lon Chaney), the three films he made with Thelma Todd, THE HAUNTED HOUSE (1928), SEVEN FOOTPRINTS TO Satan (1929) and THE HOUSE OF HORROR (1929) and THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1929; co-directed with Maurice Tourneur and Lucien Hubbard) should be worth watching if ever they turn up on DVD. I guess there's a pretty slim chance of that ever happening, but who knows in these cases?", "\"H\u00e4xan: Witchcraft Through the Ages\" is one of those films that you really cannot adequately describe--you just have to see it for yourself. And, while not all of the film is perfect and it's a bit uneven, the overall production is really quite amazing as you have a hard time believing that such special effects and makeup were possible almost a century ago.The film purports to be a history of witchcraft, though the vast majority of the film is a supposed recreation of a case from the Middle Ages. So, early metaphysics and witchery were only given a very cursory and dull portion at the very beginning of the film--sort of like a stuffy college professor's lecture spiced up a bit with visual aids. Then, when it jumps to the Middle Ages, the case is acted out with extreme vigor--and the director, Benjamin Christensen, playing an incredibly memorable Devil. Again, this is something you just have to see for yourself. This portion features some gorgeous set designs with costumes that really look like they are from the year 1400. There also is quite a bit of gratuitous nudity (often edited out of the earlier releases of the film) and some incredibly silly scenes involving pigs and cats (again, you have to see this to believe it). And, there is a certain sado-masochistic bent to the Middle Ages portion that you just have to believe. Finally, the film ends with an epilogue attributing the belief in witches to the modern psychological disorder 'hysteria'--which was very popular in Freud's day but no such disorder is in the DSM manual today which lists all known mental illnesses.This is one of the most unique and bizarre films I've ever seen. At times, it seems very dated and even silly, but at other times you can't help but feel amazed at the production...that, once again, you can't really describe. See this one...you'll know what I mean.The DVD from Criterion has a great classical score. It also includes a terrible 1968 re-release that is narrated by William Burroughs. Though adored for his strangeness and beat generation poetry, Burroughs was a terrible narrator--dry and not the least bit interesting or professional. In addition, this modern version has HUGE chunks of the old movie removed--and I can't see why they would bastardize the original film like this. It certainly does not make it more watchable or enjoyable.", "This film gives us a thoughtful look at the horrifying potential of fear, ignorance and superstition. I have to say I admire the courage Benjamin Christensen showed in making this film which not only must have offended the sensibilities of the time for the obvious reasons but also because it dared to champion reason over superstition as a way of explaining things which we do not fully understand. This film resonates with its message that those who judged others unjust may not have been just themselves.", "I found this 1922 \"documentary\" to be amazing in it's inovative and creative portrayal of witchcraft in the middle ages. Scenes of nudity and torture made this film very controversial in 1922 and caused it to be banned as well as greatly edited in later versions. Criterion has done a great job of preserving the film as it was intended to be seen with censored footage restored, an excellent tinted print, a corrected \"projection\" speed, a new score that recreates the music played at the original Danish premiere, and some interesting extras. The 1968 William Burroughs narrarated version is also included here and it's pretty ridiculous. The jazz soundtrack is just so very wrong. But still, it's interesting to see, kind of like the \"Love Conquers All\" version of Brazil. I think that anyone who is interested in film and film history will find this dvd facinating.", "\"H\u00e4xan\" is a bizarre film, one impressively photographed with a unique narrative structure. There are many varied perspectives on it, because, as fellow commenter mmmuconn pointed out, director Benjamin Christensen presents the film from various perspectives. I prefer the facetious and fantastic perspective, when the film's seriousness is dubious: the fictional drama of witchcraft and the trials, mostly. The documentary perspective, with the slideshow and end hypothesis that witch-hunters misunderstood hysterical women for witches, is vapid at times, if not sexist, especially given that the hypothesis is now outdated as the belief in witches with supernatural powers.Yet, to incorporate these perspectives and different means of storytelling, as well as multiple story-lines, is innovative and interesting in itself. Christensen connects them via intertitles and the use of the same actors, as well as having the fictional characters connect the stories. Christensen's narrative voice in the intertitles is occasionally bothersome and condescending, but it adds consistency and unity to the entire production. Still, as a documentary, the film fails and is unenlightening.As visual delight, however, in addition to the well-crafted narrative structure, it succeeds. Christensen had mastered visual style with his two previous Danish films: \"Sealed Orders\" (Det Hemmelighedsfulde X) and \"Blind Justice\" (H\u00e6vnens nat) (both of which I've actually seen). This includes the use of low-key lighting, silhouettes, tinting, transitional effects, masking the camera lens and camera movement. Something new is the nighttime photography. The use of close-ups during the trial does well to create intensity, which fellow Dane Carl Theodor Dreyer would make extreme use of in \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc) (1928).The shots of witches flying on broomsticks are perhaps the most remarked on and most innovative, involving a miniature model, superimposed images and a moving camera. From there, the old seamstress tells the inquisitors of images of humor, perversion, profane occult rituals and the grotesque. The costumes and sets add to the dark atmosphere. Christensen delights in playing the devil himself. He had played major roles in his previous films, including a monstrous turn in \"Blind Justice\", and, here, his performance helps to further link the narratives. \"H\u00e4xan\" was an ambitious film, and although it doesn't work entirely, it's a landmark achievement.(Note: The 1968 condensed version \"Witchcraft Through the Ages\", with narration by William S. Burroughs and a jazz score, is an abomination.)", "Imagine Tod Browning and Jean Cocteau making a film together and you might begin to get an idea of what you'll see in this film.  It's rather disjointed in its storytelling but who cares?  Where else can you see witches kissing the ass of Satan, boiling non-baptized babies, and giving birth to demons?  Not to mention getting a full tour of the state-of-the-art in medieval torture devices!   The film is really no more a documentary than \"The Blair Witch Project\" but certainly in the 1920s it must have been considered as such.  Today, it makes for great Halloween viewing, giving us a chance to re-live the chilling legends that kept us afraid of the dark as children. The otherworldly glow of 1920s cinematography will retain each creepy image in your mind like musty cobwebs.  A must-see for classic horror fans!", "And I couldn't be more pleased! I have never seen this film, but thought I would try it out, as I have always had a fascination with the grotesque, mysticism, and the occult. Haxan delivers in spades.This 1922 Danish silent film about black magic, witches, satanism, and the persecution of said subjects during the middle-ages, which attempts to make a connection between the ancient phenomena and the modern study of hysteria (modern in 1922), has been wonderfully presented by The Criterion Collection in their new dvd. This new Criterion dvd has the original 104 min. version with a newly recorded 5.0 soundtrack orchestrated from archival documentation, and the 76 min. version released in 1967, which has narration by legendary counter-culture icon William S. Burroughs.Watching the original version, I found it full of great imagery and fine silent acting. Emotions and actions are superbly conveyed by the actors, and the sets, costumes, lighting, and effects are all wonderfully done. I especially like the interrogation chamber and the Sabbath scenes, which display lots of good props and much deviltry with rather convincing special effects and make-up. The movie is structured in seven chapters, the first giving a historical account of witchcraft's origins in literature and illustrations. We then are presented with drama plays, having to do with the practice of witches, and the persecution, trying, and torturing of said witches. We are also presented with several instances of the devil manifesting and making demands on his minions. In the end, Christensen attempts to make a correlation between the acts, mannerisms, and various disfigurements anciently attributed to witches and their craft, and the modern affects of hysteria. This is apparently the most criticized part of the film, as mentioned in the commentary, and while it certainly is not as strong as the period dramas, I think it does a good job of raising valid questions, and does work with the film quite well.As for the quality of the transfer... with the exception of element specs throughout, and just a few scenes marred by scrapes, the print is very clean and clear. I thought it looked great. True, the print could have been cleaned up a bit more as far as the specs go, but not every film Criterion does will get the star treatment given Akira Kuroswa's \"Seven Samurai\". So long as contrast is good, and edges are well defined, I'm usually a happy camper, and this transfer delivers.The new score was arranged by film music specialist Gillian Anderson who attempted to recreate the music presented at the film's Danish premiere as best as possible by referencing the list of musical cues printed in the theater's weekly program notes. It includes works from Franz Schubert, Richard Wagner, Max Bruch, W.A. Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Christoph Gluck, and Ludwig Van Beethovan, as well as others. Anderson  conducted the Czech Film Orchestra in June 2001. The score does an incredible job of accompanying the film, sounds wonderful, and is is presented in 5.0 Dolby Digital.There is a knock-out commentary here. Narrated by Danish silent film scholar Caspar Tybjerg, the commentary centers on the director Benjamin Christensen's life in film, the Danish silent film industry, origin of the documentary film genre, technical aspects of Haxan, the cast of Haxan, historical aspects of the study of hysteria in psychology circles, the origins of the devil as a character in media, and of course, the phenomena of witchcraft and witch hunting. References are made to Nosferatu, Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the German Expressionist movement, The Passion of Joan of Arc, The Seventh Seal, Sigmund Freud... the list goes on and on. While there is an incredible amount of information presented here, with bibliographic references even, Tybjerg does an excellent job of tying it all together and presenting the relevance of the material to the film. This was a very engaging look at Christensen, his film, and the sociological atmosphere both during the middle-ages, and during the time of Haxan's production.As for the 1967 version narrated by William S. Burroughs, \"Witchcraft Through The Ages\"... I must say that I have not sat through the whole thing. In fact, I just watched the first two segments before finally succumbing to sleep (I have, gladly, spent a LOT of time with this dvd, but have to sleep sometime). My first impression is, while Burroughs is always so interestingly droning yet intense in the same breath, the jazz score was just plain ridiculous, in the presentation of Haxan anyway. The producer composed a jazz score for the film, which by itself, is some very hip music indeed, but it was just terribly out of place in the film. I'm sure the production was aiming to enhance drug trips rather than present the film itself. With Burroughs involvement, I don't think I'm too far of base in this. I'll have to give it another go when I've had some sleep, so I can watch the whole thing, but I doubt I'll be changing my mind. The jazz score is just too out of place, and as Christensen has often said, dialogue would ruin Haxan, as well as several silent films. After witnessing this 1967 version, I must agree with the director.For avid students of special effects, I would make an evening of it with Haxan, as well as Jean Cocteau's \"Beauty and the Beast\", and \"Der Golum\", found on Elite's \"Masterworks of the German Horror Cinema\" dvd set. Much mysticism, magic and enchantment abound in these films, and state-of-the-art at-the-time special effects to boot.I am extremely happy with this dvd, and highly recommend it to anyone who is into the study of classic film or anyone who is interested in the occult, whether solely for entertainment or as a study of sociological phenomena.", "If there is one thing I come away with in this film it is this quote near the beginning - \"The belief in sorcery and witchcraft is a result of naive notions about the mystery of the universe.\" The film is presented documentary style with the first portion being about the beliefs of the ancients in regard to sorcery, just so nobody believes that all of this came completely from the Roman Catholic church. It is interesting that there are such commonalities among the ancients and those of the middle ages. They had similar physical forms for demons and believed that sorcerers made people ill or were responsible for certain catastrophes. They never say so, but I imagine this was one way to keep people in line politically speaking. If the townspeople blame sorcerers for their dying cattle or a huge fire they are less likely to revolt against the authorities. Remember the Catholic church and the kings of the Middle Ages were in close alliance.The dramatic portion is about the last two thirds of the film in which the inquisition of the Roman Catholic Church in the middle ages is shown along with instruments of torture indicating that it would be easy to get someone to confess anything given such devices. It was much like the House Un American Activities Committee of the early 1950's. If you were called a Communist the only way to clear yourself was to name a bunch of other people as Communists. Likewise, witches under torture were forced to name a bunch of other people as witches, they were tortured, and so on. The traveling monks who did this work would thus leave a town after burning half the women to the stake and be able to say \"Wow! It's a good thing we showed up! Look how many witches you had and never even knew it!\" The film jumps to the present and says that modern science has shown that many of the symptoms of witchcraft - such as lack of sensitivity to pain - have been found to be the result of hysteria and thus has a psychological component, not a demonic one. Funny though how Christensen makes all of these hysterical people out to be women, in particular women who have lost somebody from WWI and turned to shoplifting or some other antisocial or compulsive behavior because they can't fathom going through life without the person they lost. I cut Christensen some slack on this because this film was made almost 100 years ago, plus he does show that it is women who still suffer now (in 1922) from intolerance - locked away in asylums - rather than burned at the stake as they were in the middle ages. And he encourages charity to the poor and misunderstood.The only thing I'm not sure about is the veracity of the film when it comes to the creative methods of torture. I've heard some people say that many of these devices came from a museum that simply made some of the devices up to increase sensationalism, and thus attendance and ticket sales. Still it's a fascinating piece of film work and I'd recommend it. Just realize that it is creepy enough you might not want to watch it late at night when you are alone.", "More commonly known as \"Witchcraft Through the Ages\", this is definitely one of the most bizarre, visually arresting movies of all time, even nearly 80 years later.  It starts out as a rather dry documentary, detailing medieval superstitions and folklore while showing ancient woodcarvings of witches and demons in various forms.  Then we move on into the dramatic portion of the film.  In one scene we see witches concocting potions using the body parts of corpses from the gallows.  One witch walks in carrying a bundle of sticks, and undoes the bundle revealing a decomposed human hand hidden inside.  Fans of \"The Blair Witch Project\" should take notice, especially considering that the Danish title of this film is \"Haxan\", also the name of the movie company that created \"Blair Witch\".Director Benjamin Christensen appears as a leering, tongue-wagging Satan, with very realistic makeup.  The witches are shown with the Devil and his minions performing various acts of sacrilege and perversion that must have been extremely shocking at the time the movie originally appeared, and would be offensive to many people still.  The film was banned for many years because of the depiction of these acts (not to mention the occasional nudity), as well as sacrileges performed by nuns and monks.  There are some stop-motion animation sequences (pre-Harryhousen, no less) that are very good, especially for the time.  This is a difficult movie to describe.  It really is something that you'd have to see for yourself.The version I am reviewing is actually the re-issue from 1966, with a dubbed-over narration by beat novelist/junkie William Burroughs, and a modern, jazzy score featuring Jean-Luc Ponty.  I enjoyed Burroughs' narration quite a bit, but oftimes the music is annoyingly inappropriate. Sometimes it works very well, but most of the time I was wishing for a standard orchestral, or vitaphone, score.  A Klezmer score, even, would have been very effective.  There are a few different versions available, some with subtitles and an orchestral score.  Maybe one of these days they'll come out with a version featuring the Burroughs narration along with a more appropriate orchestral score.  That would be perfect.  As it is, this an impressive, compulsively watchable film that still goes further than most dare to go, even in these much more permissive times.", "This truly singular and fascinating quasi-documentary centers on the harsh persecution of women who were found guilty of committing sacrilegious acts and worshipping Satan back in the Middle Ages. Writer/director Benjamin Christensen gives the absorbingly dark and macabre premise an extra potent sting by ingeniously grounding it in a thoroughly plausible and persuasive factual historical context. Moreover, by presenting the persecuted elderly and/or hysterical women as unfortunate wretches who have been cast aside by society he manages to make said women pitiable figures instead of hateful grotesqueries. Christensen's astute pointing out of modern society's treatment of the mentally ill being similar to the past's vicious punishment of witches and heretics articulates a chilling statement that our more knowledgeable contemporary world isn't much of an improvement over the previous more benighted one. In addition, the artful use of beautiful paintings and brooding classical music along with the vivid reenactments of various blasphemous rituals -- one black mass held in the woods climaxes with the participants literally kissing the devil's behind! -- and the church's savage condemnation of those perceived as sinners merge together to create a damning indictment on mankind's shocking capacity for extreme cruelty. Essential viewing.", "HAXAN: WITCHCRAFT THROUGH THE AGES is the famous Swedish/Danish documentary exploring the history of witchcraft through to the modern day. It's a stark and unsettling film packed with the kind of horrific imagery that has since become clich\u00e9d in the cinema, and yet some scenes retain their brutal power and feel surprisingly fresh and terrifying.The documentary begins on a slow note with lots of description and not much in the way of life, but after a time the staged dramatisations begin and this is where HAXAN comes to life. The whole \"witch hunt\" subject has been done to death, yet the storyline which plays out here is never less than engrossing. It's also surprisingly strong stuff, with explicit sequences of torture and black masses which are still tough to bear even today.Danish director Benjamin Christensen elicits strong performances from his cast members, particularly from Maren Pedersen who gives a haunting turn as the condemned witch, and the 1920s-era special effects are a lot of fun; strange how the flying broomstick scene looks better nowadays than the lamentable CGI of the Harry Potter franchise. It's interesting to watch how political sentiments - pro-feminism, anti-religion - creep into the finished film. HAXAN is a must for both horror fans and cinema fans in general.", "This isn't a \"movie\" as you would think of the term today. It actually stands as a sort of 7-part documentary of sorts about witchcraft in the Middle Ages, leading up to some striking parallels that film-maker Benjamin Christensen manages to draw with conditions in his own day (the film being made in 1922.) It's a silent movie, of course, and quite lavish by the standards of 1922. It begins in a rather simple fashion, essentially a silent \"lecture\" if you will tracing the history of witchcraft through the ages, all the way back to ancient Egypt. The film then offers a dramatization of several aspects of witchcraft - the supposed activities of witches that drew them to attention, the actions of the authorities (and, especially, church authorities) in putting them on trial with all of the excesses involved, including a truly unsettling look at various methods of torture that were used to force confessions out of these poor unfortunates. Finally, Christensen brings us up to \"present day\" 1922, and makes some interesting connections between the things that caused many to be condemned for witchcraft in earlier centuries and the condition known at the time as \"hysteria\" - pointing out effectively that not only were the condemned witches innocent, many of them were probably mentally ill. There's a good critique of superstition throughout this, and the point is made that while witchcraft may no longer be the concern in 1922, superstition still exists in many ways.\"Haxan\" is usually classified as an early example of a horror movie. I don't know how it was seen in 1922, but I wouldn't call it that - certainly not by modern standards. It's more of what I would think of as a \"docu-drama.\" It's well-made and obviously well researched and almost 100 years later still has a valid point to make about the dangers of superstition. (8/10)", "This is a documentary, but a documentary that doesn't give much informations. It gives more of an emotional insight of what witchcraft meant back in the days. The movie transported that amazingly. - A truly unusual documentary.My god, I am amazed what you can do without color, without voices and without modern special effects. I have never seen so realistic looking mystical creatures. Even though you don't see \"a lot\", this is a great visual experience.The musical score: I am a fan of classical music, even with a black screen, I would have loved watching the movie. Absolutely fitting classical scores have been used for this movie.", "This is a review of the silent version.Benjamin Christensen's silent masterpiece \"H\u00e4xan\" of 1922 is easily one of the most impressive and awe-inspiring experiences a fan of Horror or cineaste in general can have. This film is fascinating and brilliant in so many aspects that it is hard to decide where to start. \"H\u00e4xan\" (aka. \"H\u00e4xan\" - Witchcraft Through the Ages\") is a groundbreaking film, amazing and scandalous for its time in both its topics and its images, but its value as a classic and milestone is by far not the only quality this masterpiece bears. Not only is \"H\u00e4xan\" one of the most fascinating and groundbreaking films made in the 1920s, it is one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences to date.The film breathtakingly follows the topic of witchcraft and witch-hunts in seven chapters, from different points of view, and in different styles. It begins fascinating already, with documentary-style explanations about the idea of witches,demons and sorcery in pagan cultures and medieval societies. The film then continues to show amazingly detailed examples of how the medieval European ideas of witchcraft were, how the people imagined the witches' pact with the devil, and their unholy rites. Some other chapters focus on the topic of medieval witch-hunts, and personal fates of those accused and their accusers.Back when it was made, the film was heavily censored in many countries for its macabre topics and, especially for its explicit depictions. And indeed the film includes footage some of which one would not hold possible in a film from the time. It was not only the realistic, graphic depiction of torture in witch trials that shocked censors of time, but also the macabre rituals of witchery. I do not want to give away too much, but these scenes sure were shocking and unspeakably macabre back then. Some of them are still shocking today and all of them are fascinating. The film is also visually stunning, and incredibly creepy at times. Be it the devils and demons, the witches and their feasts, or the madness of witch-hunts and inquisition - all these scenes are brilliantly depicted in a breathtaking, immensely eerie manner. The astonishing black and white cinematography, and the duskiness of film of the time, only improve on this impression. Writer/director Benjamin Christensen as well as Art director Richard Louw, cinematographer Johan Ankerstjerne and editor Edla Hasen prove exceptional visual talent. Some of the visuals, such as the scenes when witches fly over the countryside on broomsticks are incredible for the time. Every single sequence of this is astonishing - \"H\u00e4xan\" simply is a film that fascinates on all levels. There is also a voiced-over English language version which was narrated by Willam S. Burroughs, which I have not yet seen. If I am considered, however, silence is golden in the case of \"H\u00e4xan\". The scenes are accompanied by a brilliant score, and the inter-titles are interesting and comprehensive. I also found many of the performances to be impressive.I am always willing to accept different tastes in cinema, but whoever does not appreciate the greatness of \"H\u00e4xan\" is just plain wrong. This is an incredible cinematic experience that is intriguing and tantalizing beyond comparison. Nobody interested in cinema could possibly afford to miss this wonderful gem. \"H\u00e4xan\" is a uniquely brilliant film, and one of the most fascinating masterpieces in the history of motion pictures! 10/10", "Directed by Scandinavian filmmaker Benjamin Christensen, \u0091Haxan' / \u0091Witchcraft Through the Ages' (1922) is a head-trippy silent film depicting black magic, witchcraft, and demonology from the middle ages to the 20th century.  Shot and presented in documentary form, the film is more akin to a pseudo-scholarly lecture with moving visual aids.  Not as intense or as shocking today as upon its initial release, the film is filled with nightmarish images that are certainly profane and explicit, but also humorous and downright silly.Yes, sex goes hand-in-hand with Satan, and Christensen's flamboyant portrayal of the aforementioned character, complete with flicking, wanton tongue, drives home the point (well, that and a peppering of nudity). Unique to say the least, \u0091Haxan' is a rather weird curio of a film with some incredibly atmospheric, somewhat graphic images, esp. for that era.The Criterion dvd includes the silent original and the 1968 re-release with an electric jazz-fusion score by Jean Luc Ponty and narration by William S. Burroughs.  Burroughs' voice is a treat in itself, and the jazz-fusion score is absolutely frenetic.   --- david ross smith", "There are probably spoilers in here, so watch out!  Enter at your own risk. So I'm walking through Borders the other night and what do I come upon but the Criterion collection version of this movie.  I'd heared a lot of vague things like \"one of the most bizarre film ever made\" and I'd always wanted to.  I hadn't actually seen it, and the fact that I'd never before been able to locate a copy of it was always nagging at me.  Here was my chance to own it, so I got it. Wow.  This has got to be one of the the trippiest pieces of film ever put togeather.  Can you name any other movie that reproduces so vividly those famous woodcuts from the middle ages showing the witches sabbath?  Are there any other films that offer the same pitch-black whit and irony that this movie does, or that recreates the middle ages so vividly?  And what other movie has a scene were a bunch of pretty wenches dance lustfully on a cross and then get down and kiss Satan's backside? Yes, there's all that.  There is all that and more.  There are scenes where a tiny old woman slips a love potion into the drink of a slobbering, gluttonous monk that has stolen her heart.  There is a scene where a warlock unwraps a hand and arm he took from a human corpse and breaks off one of the fingers (I think he then eats it, if my memory serves me).  There's some dead baby foo, heaps of naked flesh, crazy nuns running around, torture scenes, and (best of all) a bit where the devil himself, played by director Benjamin Christiansen, appears at a window to temps a nude wife to leave her sleeping husband and come out and play in the garden.  At times it feals like an porno made by Anton LeVey, with a strangely sexy devil as the centerpiece.  In every scene, though, we're garenteed Rembrant lighting, brilliant art direction and an exceptional cast of characters. There are several versions of this movie.  As of yet (this review), I've only seen the two versions that are on the Criterion disk.  Of the two, I'll saw that I did not prefer the 1968 version, although anything that William Burroughs is involved with can't be all bad.", "The concept of Haxan is deceptively simple. It's a dramatization of witchcraft throughout the ages providing reenactments largely based on the Malleus Maleficarum a 13th century witch-hunting manual. There isn't really a formal narrative though director Benjamin Christensen himself becomes the reoccurring character of the devil throughout the film's various vignettes. It's split into four acts: one setting the standard for what witchcraft is, two giving the audience rhetorical and increasingly surreal \"evidence\" of witchcraft and the last giving us a pat explanation for witchcraft in a modern context.What sets Haxan apart from other surviving films of the silent era is it's attempt to construct a central argument and support it with \"evidence\" in the form of its reenactments. It doesn't work but the visual intelligence and editing of Haxan is leaps and bounds above anything Edison Manufacturing ever released. The comparisons between D.W. Griffith and Christensen are certainly well founded as Christensen provides coherence and insight amid the film's proto- surreal cinematography. He even provides some silhouetted animation that channels Lotte Reiniger's The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926).Yet just like Luis Bunuel's L'age d'Or (1930), Haxan sells itself as a documentary of sorts. The first act of the film struts across the screen with all the authority of an anthropology professor, dully pointing at this and that as evidence of witchcraft. There are still images of paintings and woodcarvings in addition to a moving diagram of the heliocentric solar system; all signalling to the existence of witchcraft in all its ugly, foul and murderous forms. As the other acts take over, so do our emotions. Only the \"bad guy\" as it were, becomes hypocritical clerics and gullible townsfolk. Are these poor desperate women victims of he times or are they truly accessories of the devil? It's clear the film wants to have it both ways.The film ultimately deconstructs the act of witchcraft from one of maleficence and devil worship to one of mental illness; cheer- leading for the current time's rational thinking winning out against superstition. It's this last act's classroom lecture-like prognostications, that stringently frames what we just saw in an un- disputable context, that ruins the film. It's as if we were put into a somnambulist trance; images of an almost existential nature filling our head with complex thoughts. Then like a blunt hammer, the film knocks us into reality and asks \"what did you learn?\" Plus, considering the film was released in 1922, we're experiencing a \"modern\" rationality that included the concepts of hysteria and electroshock therapy so Haxan isn't exactly the bastion of progressive thinking it thinks it is.From a historical perspective, Haxan is an interesting little relic that provides some stunning visual tableaux that rivals Nosferatu (1922) in the horror genre. Yet as a narrative, the film is an absolute mess. It ruins any credibility it has by constantly employing heavy-handed metaphor, and at times outright saying \"look how backwards we once were.\"", "It is still hard to imagine that this film was produced in the early-1920s! Haxan also illustrates the vitality of Swedish film at this time--and what a time. We can bemoan the quality of commercial film-making today, but it should be understood that the period after WWI was unique in the history of the medium, as quite a lot had yet to be done. Watch this film, and you will see the source (along with Murnau's seminal, \"Nosferatu\" of the same year)of a LOT of contemporary horror imagery. Most of our popular-images of witches, demons and horror-film monstrosity comes from this era, and Haxan is surely a great-contributor to this reservoir.Of-note, I think Ken Russell must have seen this film before making his magnum-opus, \"The Devils\" (1971). Incidents of sexual-hysteria in Convents/nunneries are well-documented in Christensen's film (and scholarly-writings), and the connection between it and \"outbreaks\" of \"posession\" and \"witchery\" are solid. And yes, that's a Freudian-analysis, because he wasn't always \"wrong.\" While we may have to strain to understand this hysteria that infected communities, we should observe that so-called witches are regularly murdered in Africa, India and Asia-in-general. It is a feature of most primitive, peasant-societies.This is still an excellent introduction to the history of witchcraft-persecution in the West, and extremely watchable. The Criterion edition is superb, you can do no better as it contains the Anthony Balch/William S. Burroughs cut of the film with the Burroughs-narration. Also, the image-quality of the 1922-cut is astounding, and must come from the camera-negative, a real treat. 1920s film-technology, we find, was very-good in the right-hands. One can even watch a film like this--or other equally-pristine films--and see that this was not so long-ago. In many-respects, we have changed very-little since the 1920s in America! With \"Satanic panics,\" \"recovered-memories,\" \"alien-abductions\" and other social-panics, we can see the roots of such reactions (and iconography) surfacing even today. A must-have for Halloween-parties!", "H\u00e4xan is a real curiosity. It's a study of witchcraft that is surely one of the first examples of docudrama. It combines non-fiction elements with dramatized sequences illustrating various aspects of witchcraft through the ages. It's not story-based but instead is made up of a number of mini-narratives alongside the non-fictional pieces.Presented in various colour filters, H\u00e4xan is a very beautiful looking film. Its use of models, variety of costumes, elaborate make-up and inventive special effects is exemplary. The film often enters the realm of the surreal and its conception of Hell and its minions is really very good; the witches Sabbath being a great example of imaginative visual film-making. H\u00e4xan is a film that has aged better than most silent movies. This is probably due to the fact that it focuses less on dramatics than was normal at the time; as a result there is a reduction in the type of melodramatic over-acting that typified, and dated, so many films from this period. The insertion of non-fictional elements into the flow comes across as quite a bold move and somewhat experimental for the time. The inclusion of shock content such as nudity, severed hands and torture, also puts the film ahead of its time. And what other film dares to include a scene showing witches kiss the Devil's behind? Or the black humour and surreal imagery of the procession of cats exiting the church guarded by the animal-men (this bit is seriously in David Lynch territory).If H\u00e4xan has a weakness, it's that it's overlong. Some of the dramatized scenes do drag on a bit and lessen the impact of the film as a whole. But, that aside, it's a very impressive and daring film with some pretty formidable imagery. Like the best silent films, H\u00e4xan derives its power from its imagery. In many ways it's one of the least dated 1920's films and comes highly recommended for fans of the silent era and/or weird cinema.", "Spoilers herein.I love old films. I love originality and genius. I greatly appreciate Eisenstein. But this film does not impress. It has two remarkable components, the photographic skill and the narrative structure.The photography (including the whole production) is what is usually noted. It is skilled, and uses original techniques. But those techniques are paraded in front of us, and though nominally in service to the story, they seem to be 1922's edition of the `Matrix' (or pick your favorite effects picture) phenomenon: impression by novel effects. There is no central notion of world. There is no soul to this vision.The narrative structure is more interesting, though I do not think deliberately so. We have an illustrated lecture on hysteria exhibiting as witchcraft ending with some vapid moralizing on then-contemporary thinking on `hysterical' women. Along the way we have:-- Showing of drawings and diaramas, where each element discussed is patronizingly pointed to by the off-screen lecturer. Ultimately, these drawings become animated.-- That animation then segues to various stagings of `how mistakes were made' in different witchcraft scenarios. These are commented upon by the lecturer in the `present,' who frequently reminds us how simple are the people. Included in this is a rather clever self-reference where the Bishop has the same pointer used earlier by Christensen (and Christensen plays the devil).-- This transitions to a short segment like the first where devices of torture are described, with `modern' actors demonstrating.-- We end with a rather clever montage where the same actress we have seen in the `modern' demonstrations reappears in some of the staged reconstructions and also in a similarly formed drama as a `modern' hysterical.We are obviously supposed to understand that we are (or should be) in the place of the lecturer, that place where the actress stands when demonstrating the thumbscrew. And we are not on the other side where the medieval reconstructions, the modern parable and much of `real life' exists. One can clearly see the intent, but it doesn't work because the images do not create enough otherworldy identity.`Caligari' attempted precisely this same definition of two worlds with the same end-of-film blurring between the two. It succeeded because there was a coherent vision in defining and centering that other world. Not so here, though I am sure it stood as a template. I cannot consider this film of importance except to note some technical skill.", "Wanted to start 2022 off with a movie that turns 100 this year, and Haxan seemed like a good candidate.This is a blend of historical-drama, fantasy-horror, and documentary, split into seven parts, looking at themes of witchcraft, religion, and insanity throughout history. In a way it's wrong to call it ahead of its time, because there's still no film to my knowledge made in the 100 years since its release that's comparable.It has some pretty shocking and grisly imagery, and a few moments are genuinely quite creepy, and there's some cool effects that are very imaginative. Because of its episodic nature, it's not always enthralling, with some parts being more interesting than others. That being said, the final part - which argues that people were defined as witches because of psychological or mental conditions that weren't yet properly understand - ties everything together well.Small complaint, but I also think the score included in the Criterion release wasn't great. Seemed a bit too upbeat for what was being shown on screen, so I'd almost recommend picking your own dark/eerie music to play in the background while watching.", "Danish filmmaker Benjamin Christensen creates a faux documentary about the evolution of witches. The first part of 15 minutes depicts witches in medieval Europe through a series of old drawn pictures. Then the movie turns into live action as a dissertation on witchcraft.I like the opening series of drawn pictures. It's a little long but it's fascinating. It fits the faux documentary style. Once it gets to the live action, I would rather have a single narrative story. I do like some of the ideas. The costumes can be a bit campy. It's a lot of animalization of demons. Kissing the butt is kind of funny. There are some good special effects. All in all, this has some fascinating concepts in this silent movie."], "tt0013442": ["In 1921, director F.W. Murnau set out to make a horror film based on Bram Stoker's novel, `Dracula,' but was denied the rights to the property by Stoker's estate.  Undeterred, however, Murnau merely changed the title to `Nosferatu,' the name of the title character to `Count Orlok,' then proceeded to make what has come to be considered nothing less than a classic of the silent film era.  An unsettling film (especially for the times in which it was made), it is a faithful adaptation of Stoker's story, and brings images to the screen, the likes of which at the time, had never before been seen.  And although by today's standards much of it may seem relatively tame, there is an innate sense of the sinister about it that is timeless.  For the same elements that so unnerved audiences in 1922 when it was released, are equally discomfiting now, most of which is courtesy of Max Schreck, who portrayed Count Orlok. \tIt was the first screen appearance for what is now the most famous vampire in history, and the German character actor Schreck brought an eerie presence to the role that has never been equaled.  Bela Lugosi may be considered the definitive Dracula-- his portrayal is certainly the most well known-- but even he could not match the sense of evil that Schreck brought to the character.  The scene in which Schreck's shadow is cast on the wall as he slowly negotiates a staircase, emphasizing his misshapen head and elongated fingers and nails, is an image that leaves an indelible impression on the memory, as does Schreck's overall appearance:  Lanky, though slightly stooped, with oversized, pointed ears and haunted, sunken eyes.  It was Schreck's greatest screen role, and had it not been for a lawsuit by Stoker's estate that prevented wide distribution of the film, it would no doubt have made him a star. \tThe supporting cast includes John gottowt, Alexander Granach, Wolfgang Heinz, Max Nemetz, Gustav von Wangenheim, Ruth Landshoff and Greta Schroder. An air of mystery surrounded the set during the filming of `Nosferatu' that became something of a myth, which began with the fact that Schreck, a method actor, was never seen by cast nor crew without his makeup and in character. And it was further perpetuated when it may have been implied by Murnau that Schreck was actually a vampire playing an actor playing a vampire, all of which goes a long way toward proving that `hype' is nothing new to the entertainment industry.  One of the three most highly regarded German directors of the times, Murnau, whose philosophy was that `nothing existed beyond the frame,' directed a number of films, but none achieved the lasting notoriety of `Nosferatu.'  For film buffs everywhere, as well as aficionados of silent pictures, this film is a must-see, and a perfect companion piece to the recently released (2000) `Shadow of the Vampire,' the film by E. Elias Merhige that chronicles the making of `Nosferatu.'  A comparatively short film-- the restored DVD version runs 81 minutes, the video, 63 minutes-- it will nevertheless provide an entertaining and memorable cinematic experience.  This is an example of not only the magic, but the magic at the very core of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.", "F.W. Murnau's version of the 'Dracula' legend still remains as distinctive and memorable as ever.  The enjoyable Bela Lugosi version is perhaps easier to watch, and strictly as light entertainment it might work better, and many later versions brought their own interpretations - but nothing matches \"Nosferatu\" for its engrossingly morbid atmosphere and its unusual interpretation of the main character.Max Schreck and Murnau were able to create an image of the vampire that remains in your mind long after seeing it.  Regardless of whether it or some other conception is closest to the 'true' Dracula (if such a thing even exists), it is quite effective, and it was particularly well-conceived for a silent screen version that cannot rely on dialogue to define a character. The settings and the story perfectly complement Schreck's weird character, creating an atmosphere full of constant strangeness, uncertainty, and foreboding.It's unnecessary (and probably impossible) to make detailed comparisons among all the film versions of the Dracula character and legend. \"Nosferatu\" stands perfectly well on its own, as a unique and skillfully done adaptation of the story, and as one of the memorable classics of the silent era.", "For copyright reasons, Bram Stoker's novel was filmed with the names of the characters changed (Orlok for Dracula, for example) but otherwise the story remains the same: a young man goes on a trip to see a mysterious count in order to sell a house, leaving his bride behind, and finds that the creature he meets is not of this world.As the extremely creepy Orlok, Max Schreck is brilliant, with his long fingernails and gaunt appearance.  A triumph in early cinematic make-up. Gustav von Wangenheim portrays the confusion of the victim well, as does Greta Schroder as his wife.  FW Murnau directed the film with flair, showing us not only shadowed vistas and abandoned castles, but the nature outside (foxes) and miniature worlds evolving under a microscope.  This film sits well with his later 'Sunrise' in showing the effect of outside forces on a young couple, as well as being one of the key early horrors in its portrayal of Stoker's anti-hero.This version of the Dracula tale remains one of the best, although all have some different perspective on the novel.  On the strength of 'Nosferatu' alone, Murnau deserves his place as a true innovator of silent cinema.", "As I'm sure it is the case for many cinema fans, my respect and admiration towards this production widely excels the enjoyment I had while watching it. \"Nosferatu\" is a milestone from every possible viewpoint and it's one of those very few movies I think everybody should view at least once (although it actually requires repeated viewings\u0085) It is the very first version of Bram Stoker's legendary vampire tale and easily the most copied film in the history of cinema. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story of young estate agent Jonathan Harker traveling to Transylvania where he acquaintances the eccentric count who feeds on blood and controls the ones he has bitten, but THIS is the original version. Shot by F.W. Murnau (who also made the equally essential titles \"Faust\" and \"Der Januskopf\") and made unforgettable by Max Schreck in his performance as the Count. And, even though this film is over 80 years old, Schreck's image is still as nightmarish as it can be. No visual or make-up effect could ever surpass the simple appearance of Max Schreck! The fact that this film is still very powerful therefore almost entirely depends on his unworldly character. \"Nosferatu\" is beautiful poetry, difficult to watch at times, but very rewarding. The sexual undertones as well as the shock-aspects have surely dated by now, but they're still present, and \u0096 as I mentioned before \u0096 they only increase my respect for Murnau and his crew. A definite must see, just make sure you're in the right mood.", "Nosferatu is a great horror movie (possibly the first ever according to some accounts), and one of the pinnacles of the German silent era of film-making. Made in the silent age by the German expressionist/auteur FW Murnau, the film has the genuine power to act creepy, odd, alluring, mythic, and beautiful by way of images and music that don't leave your mind once the film is over. It's like someone collected a stash of nightmares and pulled them together with the original Bram Stoker story of Dracula. Max Shreck, in his most notorious role (and apparently the only one really anyone's bothered to see) plays the monstrous Count Orlock, a vampire who comes out at night to tempt the living and, of course, to suck blood. Though this story of Dracula has been numerously repeated (even by the Hollywood version in the early 30s), this film is one of the prime examples of how horror SHOULD be done- dispense with cheap thrills or overloading with exposition.A director like Murnau here, who had total artistic control (abeit the film not in circulation for many years), could transform Orlock's world into one of acute, deliberate angles, long deep shadows, and painting with light like some mad artist from the dark ages. One could almost claim that this, alongside Night of the Living Dead, changed the way audiences looked at horror films, that a style and presence could be wrung from characters that bring out the worst fears and dread in common people. Years from now, long into the digital age, there may still be room for of all things a silent, non-talking effort like Nosferatu, where the terror can still be felt through the black and white (sometimes tinted) photography and stark physical performances by Schrek and the others. In short, a film like this is one of the reasons I love to watch horror movies.", "F.W. Murnau directs this unauthorized version of Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. NOSFERATU is arguably the earliest surviving screen version depicting the 'Prince of Darkness'. This German production deviates slightly from the original, but the now familiar story we all know by heart is intact. Count Dracula becomes Count Orlok and journeys to Bremen, Germany instead of London. His physical appearance is not dashing, mesmerizing or even mystical; but much resembles the rats that frequently accompany him. I find this the most eerie of all that would follow. The accompanying organ music background makes this scratchy black and white silent film an essential masterpiece. Max Schreck is immortal as Nosferatu/Count Orlok.", "1922 was when vampires were vampires not horny emotional teenagers with big teeth unlike Twilight. Nosferatu was directed by F.W. Murnau and starting Max Schreck as the Count Orlok. It's a chilling and eerie adaption of Stoker's Dracula, following the same plot somewhat and ever since it has first came to the screens in 1922, it has become a silent masterpiece of terror which to this day is the most striking and frightening portrayal of the legend. The old grainy black and white footage, and low frames per second recording somehow add to the creepiness of this film. Since it's public domain though, there have been several different re-releases over the years, a lot of which have music and voice overs that just seems out of place. It's hard to decide, when there is so many version of the film. There is a version where the music by Type O Negative\u0085somewhere. Some of the campy music; there are moments when the tension of the music doesn't even fit what's happening on the screen. It's sad to watch. The original music was more Gothic in nature and better fit the feel for the movie. The music was originally composed by Hans Erdmann but the score was never recorded. This song is by far the greatest soundtrack to this movie! All the re-mastered versions suck! Not only did the remastered versions mess up the score, but also the picture by making it gold and blue. One problem in the film, is you can't really tell the different between night and day in this film\u0085 so it's better to have it black and white for the picture. W. Murnau originally filmed Nosferatu in a color tinted version not black and white, for instance Murnau shot the night scenes in a blue tint and the day ones in a gold tint which really works at the end of film with the rising of the sun. The Kino DVD of Nosferatu is really beautiful. It's amazing how great actors had to be, by telling the story by body expressing. Max Schreck acting in Nosferatu is chilling. The Orlok make-up is so timeless. He doesn't close his eyes at any time during the film, which I find rather creepy. He was an eccentric who took his parts so seriously he remained in character during the entire shoot. Max was already known for his quirky and often seen as weird or obscure habits. He was a loner who enjoyed playing grotesque characters and mainly lived in his own world. It's a trait that adds to Schreck's macabre appearance. The other actors acting are somewhat slow and awkward. Gustav v. Wangenheim is just awful as Hutter. Makes you appreciate this classic! Interesting thing is that the name credits in this B&W film at the beginning are a bit off because Murnau didn't use any of the character's names from the original Stoker novel when he filmed Nosferatu so Bram Stoker's widow wouldn't sue him and his company, (she did though) which is why in the original German titles you have names like 'Graff Orlock' instead of Count Dracula and 'Hutter' in place of Harker and 'Ellen' in place of Mina. Only very loosely based on Bram Stoker's novel, which, I guess would have been too complex to make a film of without dialogue - and is probably over-complex anyway. It's better than Dracula somewhat. Thank goodness that the widow of Bram Stoker couldn't burn all the film due to the suing of Nosferatu. We are lucky to see this film due to that. True horror enters the soul and disturbs us, like a insecure feeling of helplessness. This film holds those emotions after all these years, it still frightens many people.", "I want you to go back, way back, before CGI effects, box office predictions, acid trip movies, black and white, even sound, we had silent films. We've of course remember them, but how many of us have really seen one? I happen to love them though, my film appreciation class made me run out and get as many silent films as possible, one of the most memorable silent films of all time is Nosferatu. A film that still to this day remains one of the most harrowing movies of all time. Say what you will about how far special effects have come into today's movies, but the silent film really made this movie into the true horror story that has memorable images and still gives me nightmares.Thomas Hutter is an employee at a real estate firm in a city called Wisborg, living with Ellen, his wife. His employer, Knock, receives a mysterious letter. Knock decides to send him to visit Count Orlok in the Carpathian Mountains to finalize the sale of a house. Hutter leaves his wife with his good friend Harding, and Harding's sister Ruth, before embarking on his multiple-month journey. He goes on the trip and he is soon picked up by Count Orlok's coach, which is driven by a strange specter that hides its face, and moves at an unnatural speed. At his arrival at the castle, whose doors open by themselves, he is welcomed by Count Orlok. His grotesque facial features hidden at this stage by his hat, Orlok initially appears to be a mere eccentric gentleman. Hutter has dinner at the castle; Orlok refuses to eat and silently reads a letter. A bell rings at midnight and a startled Hutter cuts his thumb. Count Orlok tries to suck the blood out of the wound, but stops at Hutter's horror, who then falls asleep in the parlor after a conversation with Orlok. Hutter wakes up to an empty castle with fresh wounds on his neck, he's oh so doomed at this point.The very first vampire movie of all time, when F.W. Murnau couldn't get the rights to Dracula, he created actually one of the most memorable horror movies of all time. Seriously, if you have never seen this movie, try to find it, and if you dare say that the image of Orlok waking up and rising out of his coffin doesn't scare the ever loving daylight out of you, I'm going to go all Clockwork Orange on you, tape you to a chair put toothpicks in your eye lids to keep them open and you're going to watch this in the dark. This movie is a true classic and will always remain one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.10/10", "Quite possibly my own very favourite movie. No vampire film before or since has been either as disturbing or as artful. Less overtly \"expressionistic\" than some of the other German films of the day, but no less visually impressive. Look at the seascape where Ellen/Nina/Mina pines over her departed husband. Watch those marvelous shadows, which we see in Bremen more often than the vampire itself, used especially effectively in the closing sequence.And look at Max Schreck himself! While Bram Stoker gave his Count affinity with wolves and bats, Murnau favours that rat, both in that they surround him and that he physically resembles a shaved, cadaverous rat. Spreading his pestilence, Max Schreck is truly the vilest, most loathsome villain in the history of film. The scene where he rises suddenly erect from his coffin aboard ship is one that horror directors everywhere should study very carefully.Nosferatu is also noteworthy as the origin of the idea that vampires are killed by sunlight, previously present neither in literature nor folklore. In response to the poster who complained that the vampire seems to be walking around in light before his death, these scenes are set at night. In the original versions, there was a blue tint over these scenes to let you tell night from day; it's difficult to tell the difference without them.My copy is marred with some hilarious inappropriate sound effects (such as a massive \"BOING\" when the gates of the castle open on their own accord) which I've learned not to hold against the film itself.Thank God that Florence Stoker did not manage to completely wipe this film of the face of existence.", "I despise most vampire stories. Not even Florence Stoker's dear departed husband could keep me occupied after the first act in Transylvania in \"Dracula\". The vampire has been so romanticized as an archetype (particularly during the '90s) that I can't but feel that most horror fans have forgotten exactly what made us afraid of these guys to begin with. Murnau's \"Nosferatu\" is just such a reminder and, because of that, is the only screen version of \"Dracula\" that I have ever loved.Though Murnau, in the hopes of dodging the copyright bullet, took many liberties with the novel, he actually shot a great part of the film on location (an unusual practice for the time) in the historical Dracula's old stomping grounds: the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. The town, landscapes, and castles were all for real, not just some fancy studio backdrop. To me, it helps convey the tone of authenticity, as you can believe this story being told. As for Max Schreck, no charming, suave seducer is he. With his bald head, bushy eyebrows, rat-like teeth, pointed ears, nails as long as the fingers they are attached to, emaciated build, and stare that seems to come from the bottom of Hell itself, he is the primal, archetypal image of the vampire of legend.While some could interpret this tale as a subtext to Nazism or anti-Semetism, at it's core, it's simply the tale of a monster, who brings ruin and death in his wake. That such a tale has managed to survive it's era, considering the obstacles that could have totally removed it from view, is the gain of all who have seen. Eat your heart out, Bela Lugosi.", "F.W. Murnau set the bar high for vampire movies, very high. Can not help but start praising the job Max Schreck and Murnau did to bring Count Orlok character to life on the screen. Orlok's face, hands and slender build along with his sly shuffling movements with the right camera angles and props brought a hell of a lot of general creepiness. The viewers in the twenties must have been shell shocked because they didn't tame it down which they most often did in this time period. For a full length silent feature film I found the time going fairly fast with a view dragged out scenes, that can be expected. The big bugaboo I have with Nosferatu though is the questionable ending being terribly anticlimactic. Regardless of the disappointing ending, Nosferatu is a killer film that is a must watch for horror or classic movie fans.", "This expressionist German milestone called Nosferatu-Eine Symphonie Des Grauens -Nosferatu a Symphony of Horror- turns out to be a hit in the history of world cinema and especially in terror cinema . It deals with newlyweds named Jonathan and Lucy Harker who are saddened when Harker is sent to Transylvania by employer Renfield to arrange for Count Dracula's purchase of a house across the street from the Harkers' house. Harker travels to Transylvania where he stays with the Count , is sucked by the Count, and eventually escapes from the castle. Jonathan returns to Lucy but spends all his time sitting on a chair in the living room. Nosferatu moves into the house across from the Harkers' and goes to Bremen in a ship called Demeter . The rise in deaths is accredited to a plague thought to have arrived with the Demeter. Only a woman can break his frightfull spell , a woman pure in heart who offer her blood freely to Nosferatu and will keep the vampire by his side until the cook crowed . As the vampire meets his doom when Lucy manages to keep him until after cockcrow.This German all time classic silent horror-movie from 1922 is a captivating and eerie experience with creepy images , imaginative sets and exciting touches . Max Schreck is perfect as Nosferatu with his rat face, long nails , pointed ears and skeletal frame . The story brilliantly conveys the loneliness , despair sadness of the characters .The landscape is moody and lovely and the sets are gorgeous as well as creepy , especially the phantom castle of The Count , the ship and Bremen town . The slow, somewhat exaggerated reactions of his characters brilliantly echo the performances given by the silent actors . One day, the great Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau was talking with Max Reinhardt. Reinhardt introduced Schreck to Murnau. Murnau saw talent in Schreck and hired him to play Graf (Count) Orlok in the fledgling Prana Film's first production, \"Nosferatu; Eine Symphonie Des Grauens\" -Nosferatu; A Symphony Of Horror- .The regards to Max Schreck are a mystery, he made a few pictures and we don't know anything about his life. His performance as the bald, bat-eared, close fanged Orlok remains one of the most frightening film characters in history . This brilliantly eerie motion picture is originally and compellingly directed by F.W. Murnau .This vampire masterpiece is remade in 1979 titled \u00a8Nosferatu the Vampyre\u00a8 by Werner Herzog with Klaus Kinski ,Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjnani in which Count Dracula is the victim , he does not enjoy his immortality and wants only to live, love and die like a human ,this version of Nosferatu, in places almost a frame for frame remake , it results to be an enjoyable homage . Followed by \u00a8Nosferatu in Venice\u00a8 by Augusto Caminito and Mario Caiano with Christopher Plummer , Donald Pleasence and also with Klaus Kinski . Furthermore \u00a8Shadow of the Vampire\u00a8 with Willem Defoe and John Malkovich ; it is a film about the making and production of Nosferatu ; it had to deal with a lot of strange things ,some crew members disappeared, some died, this movie focuses on the difficult relationship between Murnau, the director, and Schreck, the lead actor.", "They don't make films like this faded, haunting masterpiece of silent cinema anymore.When Dracula was first put on sale for movie rights; the one of the first men to grab it was F.W.Murnau one of the most of the famous German directors of his time. By the time word got back to them about using the rights of the name and storyline of Dracula (Owned by the rights of Florence's widow.) Murnau had alread started production on the film; so to get around it they cut out the name 'Dracula' and replaced it with Count Orlok, Jonathan Harker became Hutter and Ban Helsing became Professor Bulwer; Orlock stalks the gothic streets of Bremen instead of Vistorian London.What is so different from Nosferatu and many of the others films of the time was that most of the film was shot on actually locations around Eastern Europe; the production hardly used any studio sets. What makes the most haunting feature tho is the sense of realism and the expressionism (most evident in the interiors od Orlok's Castle) that gives the film its hypnotic visual power.If there is any film a film student would need to have in his/her collection, it's this film. Although it is a hard task to find any surving copies. The reason for this is when the film was released Florence Stoker (widow of the author of Dracula) noticed the comparsion; she pursued the case relentlessly and in July 1925 a German court ordered all prints of the film to be destroyed. Luckily for us several prints of the film survived; a few in which have still been lost over the last few 8 decades.But thanks to the 2000 release of 'Shadow of a Vampire' a film  which looks behind the filming of Nosferatu and starring John Malkovich (F.W.Murnau) and Willem Dafoe (Count Orlok) the film was released for the first time on DVD in it's full original length of 94 minutes.Sadly soon after the film hit America in 1929; at the age of 43; Murnau was killed in a car crash.\"Men must die. Nosferatu does not die!\" proclaimed the original publcity for the film. We can only hope it's the truth for this film.", "'Your Wife has a beautiful neck.'Before I begin, I must point out that vampire films aren't generally my cup of tea, but this hundred year old film held my attention from start to finish.What imagination to assemble something so daring, so unique, think of all that's happened since this was made, they truly were pioneers.Atmospheric and creepy, I'd argue that it holds up incredibly well, it's my first time watching it, I thought I'd be bored, far from it, fair to say you do need to concentrate, as you need to follow the captions, but trust me you won't feel like checking Instagram or Twitter, you'll be entertained, surprised and dare I say educated.I am so impressed by the knowledge some of the reviewers have about this film, I applaud them for sharing such information.It started off as a curiosity, it turned into eighty minutes of true entertainment. How fortunate we are that it still exists. 8/10.", "Highly influential silent horror classic. It follows the basic story of Dracula. As pretty much everybody knows, they did this adaptation of Stoker's novel without permission. His widow sued and won. The court ordered that every print of this film be destroyed. Thankfully for us, somebody saved a copy. That this film was made nearly a century ago is astonishing. The makeup for the ratlike Count Orlock, played by Max Schreck, is amazing even by modern standards. Orlock still stands to this day as the most uniquely frightening vampire ever put on film. Director F.W. Murnau creates an eerie, otherworldly atmosphere. He uses many authentic \"Old World\" locations that are very spooky. There are lots of creepy and scary moments in Nosferatu. As much as I love the Universal and Hammer Draculas for their entertainment value, I think this is the scariest of all the different versions I've seen. It's best seen at night, as most great horror films are.", "Wonderful to be able to watch this in such clarity almost 100 years after it was made. So long since I have watched it that I had forgotten how many scenes go on for so long and that there are so many telescopic fades in and out and then there are other scenes over in a flash. So many key sequences, mostly featuring the magnificent Max Schreck, seem to fly by. Iconic moments seem rushed but it is probably that I am so used to seeing these images frozen as illustrations that it comes as a surprise to see the shadowed figure gliding quickly up the stairs and encroaching upon the sleeping figure. Particularly impressed this time also with the outside sequences, some marvellously evocative and well framed shots of countryside and outbuildings and the glorious shots of Schreck's new home across the canal and not forgetting the majestic glide of the ship into harbour. Excellent as ever.", "Something that unfortunately seems to have been forgotten by many is that between WWI and the Third Reich, Germany made some impressive movies. The three that probably stand out the most are \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", \"Nosferatu\" and \"The Nibelungenlied\".The second one is still the epitome of a horror movie. Obviously, it was based on Bram Stoker's classic \"Dracula\", but put a surreal spin on it. Max Schreck, as the title character (whose name in the movie is Count Orlok), makes a scarier Dracula than Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, Frank Langella or Gary Oldman. His shaved head and long fingernails emphasize his mystique. Probably the best scene is when Count Orlok is walking up a staircase; his shadow on the wall becomes a form of horror in and of itself.All in all, \"Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens\" is naturally a must for film historians and horror fans alike. Werner Herzog's 1979 remake was even better; they further developed the title character. And \"Shadow of the Vampire\" was also quite interesting.", "I watched the Kartes Video Communications 1984 video cassette version on a 15 inch screen.  Titles were in English.  Film quality was good.  Sound was matched to action.  Cropping appeared good, and titles were completely visible.  This should give an idea of the technical quality of the release I watched.Nosferatu is one of the few silent movies with a significant following today.  It deserves a following.  The film is a suspense piece.  Still it is paced nicely so that it feels tense in the right places but never goes long enough without something happening so as to be boring.Visually Nosferatu forms the precedent for the vampire in movies.  The main difference is that Count Nosferatu has more affinity with rat than bat. Aside from this the main stream image of the vampire is based heavily on Nosferatu.  This film has been as influential on modern vampire mythology as the novel Dracula.  It is based on the novel Dracula.  Especially disturbing to me personally are Nosferatu\u00d5s twisted hands.In terms of the film\u00d5s being silent, this should not put anyone off.  The suspense/ horror genre fits well into this medium.  I was lucky enough to see a version with music matched to the scenes, but if the copy you are watching has a bad sound track just play some music you like.I recommend this film to anyone interested in the horror or suspense films. It is a bit of a cult film, but this does not keep it from being actually good.", "This movie was really impressive and quite an experience to see. Who would have ever known that a silent movie would still be so powerful now days.The power of the movie is in the fantastic atmosphere. The sets and environments are perfect and give the movie an unique atmosphere that actually is very creepy, even now days. It's also thanks to the cinematography that captured the images perfectly. One of the most atmospheric movies I have ever seen.The story is told in a great way and I must say that it's told better than any other Dracula movie later released. The movie is full with some classic horror scene's that later would inspire many other filmmakers.And yes the movie is actually scary, which is mainly thanks to Max Schreck who plays the part of Count Orlok in a most incredible way, also helped by some good make up. Most of the other performances are typically early movie stuff. Meaning that it's silly over the top at times. Gustav von Wangenheim gives a great lesson in overacting and his laugh might very well be the weirdest I have ever seen in a movie. But in a way all those performances give the movie a certain charm which makes it irresistible to watch.There are also some surprising good special effects. Better one's as in the 1931 version with Bela Lugosi anyway. Some of them were really impressive and I can imaging it really seriously freaked some people out back in 1922.Truly a piece of movie history that needs to been seen by the movie lovers, especially by those who like the horror genre. Still after 82 years one of the best horror movies of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "the first temptation - to define it as the film of Max Schreck. and the first motif is its creepy presence , so modern, escaping to the spirit of first part of XX century. The second temptation - to be seduced by strange way of Murnau to explore details. because it is the film about Dracula who remains the canon . the sketch at the basis of the image of vampire in popular culture and for the long chain of adaptations of Bram Stoker novel. and , the novel does difference. because the war for the rights of adaptation, the right tone about a story created by letters are the fundamental virtues of this pure masterpiece.", "'Nosferatu' opens with a man looking at his reflection in a mirror.  Besides its symbolic significance, this is a perfect distillation of his character, that of a vain, narcissistic, absurdly self-confident to the point of machismo, married man largely indifferent to a wife he abruptly leaves to make the fortune worthy of a man of his merits.  He ain't afraid of no ghosts, nor robbers.  So, the image he sees in that mirror is one of wholeness, perfection - I am Hutter, I command all I see, my unity of identity is linked to my power in body.To the viewer, however, the effect is the precise opposite.  The framing of the scene is fragmented, with the outer frame, the window and the mirror; Hutter himself is doubled - the 'real' Hutter and his reflection, or shadow. All the assumptions smilingly embodied in Hutter will thus be destroyed in conventional horror terms.His whole identity will be destroyed - the Count will suck his blood and in effect become him, if we believe the man who claims 'blood is life'. Hutter's body will first become passive, feminised as he is violated by the Count; after, he will no longer be a body, but a shadow, bloodless - literally, he shadows the Count as the latter comes to England; and symbolically, in that two men now claim possession of Hutter's wife, and both have equal claim, both being Hutter.Murnau is careful to give his horror story a genuine patina as an 'objective' story: no horror film has come as close to capturing the visual essence of all those stories that have circulated in Europe for centuries, the twisting medieval towns, the arcane religious symbolism, the plagues and mass hysteria, the crumbling castles and storm-tossed ships, the creak of wood - the look of the film feels like a crumpling manuscript setting out the story.But the film is also the portrait of a marriage.  The opening sequence chillingly reveals the sterility of a marriage before anyone has even heard of the Count - Hutter wrapped up in himself; Ellen, hypersensitive, morbid, dressed as if in mourning; the union childless; the couple, above all, separate, each completely misunderstanding the other.The image of the mirror is repeated throughout the film, connecting Hutter to the Count - the scene in Knock's office where Hutter looks at the map of Transylvania just as he did his mirror; the Count's house directly opposite Hutter's, a decaying edifice that looks like a melting, anguished face.But Ellen is linked to the Count too, her somnolent rising mirroring his. This isn't a conventional opposition between bourgeois and bestial urges, even though the Count is given the most grotesque (anti-Semitic?) animal features, and even though Murnau never lets us forget the Conut as emanation of the Hutters' dreams, desires and fears - Hutter reads that he will shadow his dreams; Ellen spends most of the film sleepwalking.All three elements of this triangle, which symbolises the one relationship, is linked to death - the Count, the undead, living in coffins of dead earth; Hutter, narcissistic, onanistic, his lifeblood siphoned from him; Ellen, the Venus fly-trap, self-abnegating destroyer of the destroying force.  Hutter ends the film as he began, alone, his lust for money and status destroying the union that crowned it.  The contrivance of society and respectability is swept away by the malaise of nature, those gendered forests, tides and moons, as if the Count and Ellen are part of the one female nature Hutter cannot accomodate.Such Freudiana is undermined in the film in two ways - in the disarming comedy of the piece, the Count often seeming to have strayed from a silent comedy, running around London with his coffin; and by a self-reflexive examination of film, that sees the warning about vampires in the book Hutter reads linked to bestiality and the eye that is so important in the film; the turning of the film stock into negative as Hutter enters the Count's realm; the trickery, such as time lapse and fast motion, that shows the Count's mastery of time and space, but, more importantly, Murnau's mastery over the storytelling, already indicated by an unseen, but constantly intruding narrator; even Ellen's couch, which, my husband suggests , seems patterned as strips of film.  In a  movie where human sexuality is impossible, the characters seem content to be voyeurs, like the film audience, staving off the death, the loss of identity, or at least its fragmentation, that contact with another person entails.", "I gave this a late night viewing and perhaps being tired made full concentration difficult, but this was not an easy film to evaluate in light of it being a silent film made in Germany in 1922 by Murnau.The overall impression is one of familiarity with the \"Dracula\" theme, the young man being driven by a coach that will only go so far toward its destination before he has to get out and walk. (This has happened in so many horror stories that we can see it all began with stories like \"Dracula\" on which this is based). GUSTAV VON WANGENHEIM is the young man and he overacts with gusto in typical silent film manner. GRETA SCHRODER is his wife, Ellen, who seems to have an unusually strong link to Count Orlock's menacing presence. She's the woman whose portrait he is shown, upon which he makes the film's most famous remark: \"What a lovely throat!\" It's all very impressionistic, with dark shadows particularly menacing when they show Count Orlock's grotesque form (including his long fingernails) as he looks for victims. Some of the plot elements seem a little obscure which may be a fault of the title cards.Very impressive was the musical score from 1997 by James Bernard which had the appropriately eerie effect that caught the mood of the piece with its somber atmosphere.Damp and chilly are the words that come to mind when I think of this film and its overall effect. I can certainly see why it has the reputation it has as a classic horror film with allowances being made for the style of acting that was anything but subtle by today's standards. Worth a look, but not a film I'm likely to view again.", "FW Murnau's Nosferatu - the most famous silent horror film, the first adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula and containing some of the most memorable and terrifying images ever committed to celluloid.The German Expressionist directors can be credited with inventing the horror genre. Not that works with a horror theme hadn't been made earlier elsewhere, but the Germans were the first filmmakers to actually use the medium of cinema to frighten the audience. In Nosferatu this is not just done by the disturbing look of the vampire, but by a number of cinematic techniques. For example, the huge distorted shadows are more eerie than seeing the real thing. He also nearly always has the vampire walking towards the camera, as if he is advancing upon the audience.Max Shrek's as Dracula (or Graf Orlok, depending on the version) has to rank as one of the best performances of silent cinema. Not only is the vampire a brilliantly creepy creation in makeup, but the way Shrek moves and positions himself \u0096 stiff, spindly and slow, like an animated corpse \u0096 completes the character. The parts of the original Dracula novel which dealt with the vampire's ability to change into the shapes of various animals was dropped for Nosferatu, but Murnau references them by having Shrek creep like a rat, hunch his shoulders like a bat, rub his hands together like a fly and so on.Other than Max Shrek, the other actors are decent but not outstanding. The performances are highly melodramatic and exaggerated, even by silent film standards. This was probably a deliberate request by Murnau to heighten the unreal quality throughout the picture, although having said that he favoured over-the-top performances even in straight dramas like Sunrise (1927).Murnau had a great eye for space. His shots are often reminiscent of works by the Dutch painter Vermeer \u0096 cramped interiors with open doors leading to distant vanishing points. This helps to give the film a tight, claustrophobic feel.Like DW Griffith, Murnau makes extensive use of cross-cutting. However, whereas Griffith would use cross-cutting to make comparisons between historical events or to create a tense race-against-time, in Nosferatu the effect is much more psychological. He reveals the psychic link between Jonathon and Nina by cutting between him being attacked by the vampire and her nightmare; he defines Renfield by cutting from him to Van Helsing describing a carnivorous plant; he shows Nina's troubled mental state by cutting from her sleepwalking to shots of the raging sea.Nosferatu is an early landmark in horror films. It's not Murnau's best though, and also sadly due to its history there are no perfect prints available. But the fact that it is still so well known and still has the power to creep out modern audiences is testament to it as a great piece of film-making.", "About the only classic horror film that even comes close to NOSFERATU in terror is the early sound film, FREAKS. Despite the ability to use modern appliances and technology to make extremely graphic horror movies today, the stuff being called horror just doesn't come close to these older films when it comes to setting a mood and scaring the pants off you.This version of Dracula is different from the Bram Stoker novel in several ways because the producers of the film didn't want to pay royalties! So, Dracula's name was changed to Dr. Orlock and the title itself was also changed. Otherwise, its a very similar movie. In fact, the plot is so close I won't even bother to give a summary other than to say that the way the vampire dies in the end is VERY different from other Dracula films (unless you see the 1979 remake of NOSFERATU, which, of course, is similar).Finally, I strongly recommend you try to watch Shadow of the Vampire, a movie starring John Malkovich where they recreate dramatically the story behind the film. All of Murnau's strange idiosyncrasies are revealed and this is a real great addition to the original film.So why is it so creepy? Well, like the 1931 version, it's filmed in glorious black and white--a must for good horror. Secondly, this Dracula is not the suave and handsome guy he is in some other films. In fact, he's downright awful! With a bald head, pointed ears, weird fangs that consist of his front two teeth and incredibly long, slender and pointed fingers, he is like a nightmare come to life!! Plus, and this is the absolutely creepiest part, his leaving his coffin early is the film will scare the life out of the viewer--as instead of bending his body to get up, he rises up vertically (they must have had someone underneath pushing him up to give this effect) and rats come pouring out of the coffin from his feet! This is a sight no other Dracula film can equal.The only negatives are the rather old-fashioned plot elements here and there. However, director F. W. Murnau (who made a career out of making magical and other-worldly images on film) did an amazing job in creating the mood and magic that was this film and these very minor problems can easily be forgiven.", "There's no doubt that this is a technically brilliant movie - groundbreaking considering that it was made in 1922. It's well filmed and features generally pretty good performances from its cast all around, within the parameters you would expect for the style of acting used in silent films of the era. It also gives us the German actor Max Schreck as Count Orlok - who may be the creepiest, most monstrous and most frightening take on the Dracula character ever - far more than Bela Lugosi (who basically defines the role) could ever hope for. It's even funny in places - I think of the scene where Orlock looks at a picture of Hutter's wife and says \"your wife has a beautiful neck.\" It is, of course, a variation on the Dracula story, with the names changed and some significant parts of the story changed to get around the fact that director F.W. Murnau didn't have the rights to the story. But those changes don't detract from the basic story. In fact, they may enhance it by giving this a fresher sense. You don't know exactly what's going to happen because there are some differences. It has a lot going for it no doubt.But something's not right. Maybe - as good as Schreck was (and even perhaps superior to Lugosi) - Lugosi's take on the character has so entranced all subsequent adaptations of the story that this just doesn't seem like the story. I found it very difficult to enter into this. It's not a problem with silent movies. I've enjoyed a number of silent movies over the years. But as well made as this was, this just didn't draw me in. I had to sit with it a number of times before I could sit through the whole thing - and at 1:20 it's not very long. And yet, to be honest, there's not any particular problem I can put my finger on. For all the good things involved with this production, something just wasn't working for me. It's unsatisfying to me that I can't explain what the problem was. It's just that there was a problem somewhere. Still, a movie as well made as this that was made when it was can't get anything less than 6/10."], "tt0013458": ["ONE EXCITING NIGHT is an odd film directed by D.W. Griffith. It stars Carol Dempster and Henry Hull. The film is unusual for Griffith because it's a comic mystery. Although the film is too long, it's entertaining.Dempster is an unknowing heiress who is always seeking the love of her mother. But the woman is not her mother. Dempster is being pawned off on an older suitor who is after her estate. At a party she meets and falls for Hull, but then odd happenings begin and there is a murder.The intricate plot is probably defeated by the long running time, but this film is underrated possibly because it lacks major stars. Yet Henry Hull is an appealing leading man here, and Carol Dempster is a surprise.A minor actress in the teens, Dempster was elevated to stardom in the 20s by Griffith after she became his mistress. Although Dempster has historically been regarded as a dud, she's quite good here as the awkward heroine, Agnes Harrington. She has an angular beauty that was slightly out of step with the era's ideals, but in the right role, Dempster was a good actress. In Griffith's THE SORROWS OF Satan and ISN'T LIFE WONDFERUL, Dempster turns in excellent performances. She retired from films before talkies came in and never looked back.Also good are Margaret Dale as the \"mother,\" Porter Strong as Romeo, Morgan Wallace as Rockmaine, and Charles Emmett Mack as the \"guest.\"Filming locations are quite good.", "\"One Exciting Night\" (1922) is not terribly exciting, although it has its moments. Alas, without Billy Bitzer at the camera, D.W. Griffith is not exactly the most innovative of directors. Everything is played at the camera as if the actors were on a stage. There is only one pan (broken into two shots by an insert) in the entire movie. The film is obviously angled at keen Carol Dempster fans. She is given more close-ups than the rest of the extensive cast combined. The plot is not particularly interesting, but \u2013 chiefly thanks to Dempster \u2013 it just manages to hold attention \u2013 in Alpha DVD's quite watchable cutdown 108 minutes version anyway. (The movie originally ran 128 minutes).", "THE BAT by Avery Hopwood opened in August of 1920 and was a smash that ran for more than two years and 867 performances. After wrapping on ORPHANS OF THE STORM, Griffith worked on his next project, which was -- ahem -- inspired by the Broadway hit. It would be a modern dress affair, with contemporary characters and thrills, and humor and all that good stuff. There would be a missing heir, a treasure of half a million dollars to be found, a fiendish, masked murderer running around, reaching from hidden panels in the wall to strangle random house guests, a romance of young people and comic lower-class servants.There are some issues.First, there's the technical issue of its length. The IMDb lists it as running 128 minutes. The copy I saw on YouTube, derived from the Killiam Collection, timed at 146 minutes, and crawled. I adjusted the speed so it ran a touch over a hundred minutes. Now it was brisk. Unfortunately, for the first three-quarters of its length, it's a snooze.The opening certainly took its time, with a long prologue that ran backwards sixteen years from the main events, setting up the ending with little surprise. The prologue was about 45 minutes on the Killiam print, 30 in real life. I would have cut it entirely, and dropped a little of the background into the rest of the picture, for a nice 70-minute feature.Griffith might have wished to make a small picture, but he could not. He was the Great Director, and his public demanded major pieces from him. He could no more direct a five-reel movie than Fannie Hurst could turn out limericks. Like Cecil Demille in his last decade, every movie had to be an epic with a finale that would top his last epic.Next there's the matter of casting. I won't even go into the actors in blackface playing comic servants. It might have still played in 1922, barely, but looking at them now, it's just insulting. Worse, Griffith had lost the Gish sisters and Richard Barthelmess, and he was stuck with Carol Dempster. Miss Dempster is fine in the closing sequence of the movie, when she nerves herself up to go out after the villain. She was fine at playing the modern -- for 1922 -- woman. Unfortunately, earlier in the movie, she plays the stereotypical Griffith heroine: sixteen years old, virginal, browbeaten by her mother and hiding in her blankets. She's worse than poor. She's ridiculous in the role.So we have a slow, sodden beginning played by the wrong actors, leading up to the epic Griffith finish, and that ending is fine. People run around. A hurricane starts up. It rips trees and houses apart, it knocks down the players, it threatens them with death, and it's truly exciting.Unfortunately, by then, I didn't care. The long prologue told me how it would come out. The dictates of drama told me that boy would get girl. I had the leisure to figure out who the villain was, and why that threatening man who invades the girls' bedroom was no threat. There was no dramatic tension, just the socko finish, like the Little Colonel leading the charge, or Lilian Gish leaping from ice floe to ice floe. Too bad. Too little, too late.", "One Exciting Night (1922)** (out of 4)D.W. Griffith's only venture into the \"old dark house/mystery\" genre is a rather strange film that also mixes in comedy but in the end it just doesn't work. A baby is born in Africa and sixteen years later she is about to gain control of an estate, although she doesn't know this. Soon someone shows up on the scene committing murders but who is it? On the whole this is a very average film due in large part to its incredible running time, which nearly reaches two and a half hours. The final hour of the film contains about twelve different endings where you think the film is over but it keeps going on and on and on. Henry Hull delivers a good performance but the rest of the cast is rather lame. The biggest highlight is a hurricane at the end of the film, which contains some of the greatest special effects of its time. There's a moment when a servant takes shelter by a house only to have the house tear apart and fly away while the actor is standing there.", "The only thing exciting in \"One Exciting Night,\" D.W. Griffith's slow go at the old dark house formula, is the climactic hurricane sequence. Everything else tends to be extremely dull, drawn out, convoluted, overly explained, exposition-heavy, repetitive and racist. Not only unexciting--it's excruciating, really--it doesn't take place in one night, either, although it should have... it so much should have. In fact, the narrative takes place within nearly two decades. In the complete version of the film, at least, it's over an hour in before it gets to the night in question (I viewed the Critic's Choice VHS from the '90s, which runs 124 minutes). Everything before that should've been cut; it's just unnecessary subplot and filler. I know this was early in the subgenre of old dark house horror comedies, but still, Griffith demonstrated no appreciation that these things are supposed to be light and fast paced. Instead, he indulged in his worst tendencies of excess as a filmmaker: plentiful and verbose title cards, leading the spectator ad nauseam through every plot point, including frequently replaying scenes, too many characters and melodramatic subplots, bland and simplistic appeals to grande themes (greed, love, life, death), African-American stereotypes portrayed by white actors in blackface and minstrel show antics.There are five title cards before we even see an image with scenery or characters in the film. Furthermore, Griffith contradicts himself in them by calling this a \"little effort\" before going on, \"In this absolute departure from all OLD METHODS of story telling we leave much to YOUR IMAGINATION besides the detection of who is the villain. Therefore it is well to watch closely the early scenes as they become important later on.\" None of that is true. This was a bloated effort, it is very much in the vein of old methods of storytelling, with Griffith's usual Victorian melodrama and the old dark house stuff being ripped off the popular stage play of the time, \"The Bat\" (later adapted to screen in 1926 and 1930 by Roland West), and Griffith's storytelling leaves very little to the imagination, including the obviousness of the villain's identity long before it's exposed, and Griffith repeats things over and over again, so there's no need to pay particularly close attention. The film is so bad, though, the best way to enjoy it may be to barely pay attention and use your imagination instead. Just make sure to tune back in near the end for the hurricane, where the repetition in the editorial form of temporal replays are acceptable--I'm OK with seeing Henry Hull hit by the same flying tree branch twice.The story begins in Africa where a mother dies, leaving a fortune to her infant child, but the next-in-line heir schemes to have a woman pretend the child is hers, thus concealing the baby's identity so that he may inherit the fortune. Upon his death, however, he admits the fraud. And, for the next two or so hours, this plot will be ignored. Jump to the states years later, and Carol Dempster agrees to a blackmail scheme to marry an older man so that he doesn't rat out her thieving and abusive mother. Now, forget that plot, too, because it doesn't really matter, and it's only mentioned a couple times later, including with one of the many flashbacks, lest we forget. Dempster meets a younger man, the hero played by Hull, who had also played the similar part in the stage version of another old dark house horror comedy, \"The Cat and the Canary\" (adapted to the screen in 1927 and a few times after that). Hull has a spooky house, so, of course, he sets about throwing a party and hiring some African-American servants. That a bootlegger is murdered in the house and that he's a prime suspect doesn't deter him in these activities in the least. Only after another man is murdered, and he's once again a prime suspect, and after he discovers that the bootlegger hid half a million dollars in his home does the situation become tense. This is also when the old dark house formula finally kicks in.And most of the subgenre's tropes are here in spades--at least the ones that also appear in \"The Bat\": secret passages and mysterious panels, hidden cash, nighttime shadows, hands reaching out from hidden corners to grab people, flickering lights, a storm, people running around scaring themselves silly, comic relief, a whodunit murder mystery and a masked villain. Unfortunately, most of the comic relief is debasing slapstick of an African-American stereotype named Romeo played by a white actor in blackface, portrayed as a dishonest (Griffith's title cards inform us that he found the war medal he passes off as having earned), running around scared and wide-eyed at the sight of almost everything. Meanwhile, another blackfaced character is referred to by two different racial slurs and as \"primitive,\" and that's not even counting Griffith's title card informing us that, \"It is well known that Black Sam is the dark terror of the bootleggers' band.\" In the end, all of the blackfaced caricatures, as well as the extras that include some actual African Americans, are portrayed as either servile, stupid or lazy.Another title card, \"Pictures -- white man's magic to be treasured,\" seems to sum up well what Griffith thought of his own filmmaking prowess. Yet, while he was one of the more innovative of pioneering directors at Biograph and into his features of the 1910s; in the 1920s, with one or two exceptions, his work is among the most detestable, as the quality of his pictures suffered from the financial changes in Hollywood and as he failed to keep abreast of advances in content, tone or technical matters, with his dated racial and Victorian ideals becoming ever more burdensome within inferior goods.", "D. W. Griffith made his only venture into the mystery field here, primarily due to the success of the \"old dark house\" genre, stimulated by Mary Roberts Rinehart's novel, THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE, which was very successfully filmed and staged (with Avery Hopwood) as THE BAT.  The script written by Griffith (as Irene Sinclair) is extremely complicated, and engages the cast in a jointed series of plots revolving for the most part about attempts at discovery of a missing half-million dollars of bootlegger takings, secreted somewhere within a  mansion that is replete with secret passages and hidden panels. Griffith gave his mistress, Carol Dempster, the female lead romantically linked with Henry Hull, whose kinetic limberness is difficult to match, although she acts well, and vigorously too, as much of the scenario provides comedic lunacy; Morgan Wallace is particularly engaging as a Dempster suitor.  The film is well-edited, and the special effects by Edward Scholl are creative, to say the least; however, Griffith's penchant for adding numerous story lines to his cinematic landscape causes more than a bit of weariness in the viewer as the work pitches constantly among romantic, mystery and comedy themes; as to be expected, the small moments of detail when the talented players are given rein are generally the most satisfying.", "Like so many D.W. Griffith films, \"One Exciting Nigh\": has an informative subtitle, so \"A Comedy Drama of Mystery\" opens in \"somber Africa\", where the origin of Carol Dempster (as Agnes Harrington) is shown. Moreover, title cards advise viewers to watch the film's beginning scenes with intensity. It's good advice. Indeed, the well-designed plot unfolds in layers; and, the film's characterizations are a great strength. The drama centers on Ms. Dempster, and two suitors - Henry Hull (as John Fairfax) and Morgan Wallace (as J. Wilson Rockmaine). Dempster has accepted a proposal of marriage to Mr. Wallace; not for love, but to save her foster mother from scandal; Wallace witnessed Mrs. Harrington (Margaret Dale) steal a watch, as the Harrington family faced financial ruin. Then, Dempster catches Mr. Hull's eye; and, the two fall desperately in loveIntricate, imaginative storytelling, and direction from Griffith, who weaves his characters into the standard mysterious \"Old Dark House\" formula, involving, of course, money and murder. The film's strong performances are tainted by some disturbingly offensive racial stereotypes. For example, the depiction of ambition among black-faced Porter Strong (as Romeo Washington), introduced in his listless \"colored\" community, is bound to leave you stone-faced. At least Mr. Strong's rolling bug-eyed \"darkie\" will provide a classic example of a racist character \"type\", if you're interested. However, such depictions taint an otherwise excellent, near indispensable, Griffith film.Dempster was not always well-served by mentor Griffith; but, herein, she excels. Her awkwardly beautiful, and naively vulnerable character offered Dempster one of her best roles; and, it is delivered at a time when she had the silent acting prowess necessary for a leading role. Hull is outstanding as her leading man; a thoroughly believable young romantic, he makes their relationship work. Watch for the great courtship scene with Hull, Dempster, and her parasol; it defines their young, innocent love. Wallace is fine as the man who comes between them. Smaller roles, like Charles Mack's turn as an unfortunate houseguest, are likewise expertly played. \"One Exciting Night\" is perhaps too long; but, Griffith keeps thing moving, and little seems superfluous. The close-to-the-edge and ending scenes could blow you away.******** One Exciting Night (10/2/22) D.W. Griffith ~ Carol Dempster, Henry Hull, Morgan Wallace, Charles Emmett Mack", "There are two reasons why you'd rent One Exciting Night, an old silent movie nearly 100 years old: Either you love D.W. Griffith's movies, or you love Henry Hull and this is the only silent movie of his you can get your hands on. I watched it for Henry, and it was worth it. He's so cute! With the advent of talkies, and his fame on Broadway for playing the old, crotchety Jeeter in Tobacco Road, he was almost always made up to be an old man and told to use a gruff, gravely voice. You'd never think, watching him in Jesse James or Great Expectations, that he looked like Matt Dillon when he was young! Seriously, folks, if you don't think it's possible that the grizzly old doctor from High Sierra was ever handsome, you've got to rent this silent movie.This long romance-mystery takes place mostly in a beautiful mansion. Guests get together for a party, but there's a burglary underfoot. While dead bodies pop up and detectives try to figure things out, there's also a love story. The beautiful Carol Dempster feels pressured to marry the older, creepy Morgan Wallace because her mother wants his money, but as soon as she meets Henry Hull, her heart tells her to disobey.This movie has a running time of 2 \u00bd hours, and it easily could have been edited down to a flat two hours if all the racism was eliminated. I'll admit it leaves a really bad taste in your mouth and ruins the rest of the movie. The prominent characters of color are white actors in blackface, and while it's not hard to believe black actors wouldn't want to take such insulting roles, it's more likely that the studio preferred to pay white actors.If you do decide to watch it, with your fast-forward button handy, you'll be treated to another D.W. Griffith epic. This may start out as a simple house party, but you'll get to see where the studio put its money: a huge rainstorm that topples trees threatens to tear the young lovers apart. Henry not only wrestles with the rain, trees, and mud, but he also gets into fistfights with bad guys and gets to woo Carol with a big, sweeping kiss. This movie contains one of two onscreen kisses I've seen him enjoy, so that's pretty exciting. It's a whole different ball game to master silent acting versus talkies, and it's just delightful to see Henry Hull, famous for his gravelly voice, as the young romantic lead with delicate features. Plus, Carol is cute as a button and gets to parade around in some adorable dresses, too!", "Nice goings-on in an old mansion. But several flaws as well. The plot is a bit over-written, and there are numerous warnings on title cards to be very attentive, to be very afraid and so on. One step away from a brainwash really. From the first moments it's difficult to understand who's who - especially if you have a washed out bootleg copy, such as mine. You just don't distinguish the many faces. Plus there are several black-face performances, which is really stupid, as the men who are supposed to be black servants, have especially distinctive paleface features. Needless to say, they also provide the comic relief, and needless to say, it's all about rolling the eyes, waxing stiff, falling down, and running around in terror, yelling \"lawdy, lawdy!\" or something similar. In other words, not funny. I did like the leading lady and I can't blame Griffith for falling madly in love with her. Fortunately she's not only pretty, but also quite convincing as a 16-year old precious little rich girl, hungry for her mother's love. I immediately went browsing the net and found two more films where she is in, so I'll know a bit more when these arrive. Strangely enough her career totally ended a few years after this film, and I would like to know the reason, why. The leading man was a new face to me as well, even though looking at the list of his films, I realized I have seen several, but from the later period. He looks like he could be 16 himself, whereas in reality he was 32. Very handsome and moving as a young man tortured by love, he left a very good impression on me. There are nice interiors and some very good 1922 fashions displayed. I only wish there were a good, sharp, legitimate copy released. Despite some obvious flaws in the story, the complexity of the plot and the irritating comic subplot, a thoroughly enjoyable dark old house flick.", "This was long for a silent film, over two hours, but probably the best silent film I have seen to date.The story starts in Africa where a man is traveling with his sister-in-law, who is ill and just delivered a baby girl. They receive news that his brother, her husband was gravely ill himself. Subsequently both parents die...thinking that if he gets rid of the baby there is nothing to stop him from inheriting the estate, title and fortune...the uncle first thinks of killing the baby girl, but instead gives her to the nurse to take to America and raise in anonymity.Sixteen years later, the girl named Agnes has been raised by this cold nurse who she believes to be her mother...but not really understanding warm motherly affection. The nurse having run out of money compromises herself and gets observed stealing by a wealthy older man. This man takes advantage of the situation by promising not to turn her in if she will marry young Agnes to him. After explaining the situation to Agnes she agrees to sacrifice herself to the old creepy man in marriage, which is how they become engaged.Subsequently, a young wealthy land owner returns from his travels and meets Agnes...the two fall in love. He invites Agnes and her \"mother\" to stay at his estate.The estate which has been unoccupied for years has, unbeknownst to the young man, been being used by bootleggers to store their stock bootleg. Learning the house is being opened up again, they rush to get their supplies out the back.In the evening there is a big dinner party, but we discover that before the dinner party one bootlegger turned on the other and tried to steal a half a million dollars in cash. He is cornered and killed by his partner but not before he managed to stash the cash. While the staff are opening the house up, the young man's butler discovers the bag containing the cash...but he only sees the important documents that were placed by the bootlegger on top. Thinking the papers were important he takes them downstairs and locks them in the safe which is behind a hidden panel in the wall.Staff members discover the murdered bootlegger upstairs and the police detectives are called. Meanwhile a dinner party happens and many guests and staff are behaving suspiciously as people sneak off...we assume one of them is the murderer and looking for the money.And so this becomes a murder mystery...with lots of shady characters!It was great...although I am not sure it needed a hurricane like storm, but it has one!\"Don't reveal the villain and pay attention to the early scenes...\"I am going to honor their wishes and not share who the villain is, only to say that I was able to guess but it did not dim my delight with the film at all.A bit of a surprise that I enjoyed tremendously!I loved one of the end scenes tremendously...a hand kiss followed by a kiss on the cheek (do you know which one).I highly recommend this to silent movie fans and just cinema fans in general!\"Mystery of love, the sweetest of mysteries without which there would be no light...no music...\"\"That moment when a man asks a woman to go with him on the path of Love. The path that goes through life and on through eternity.\"", "...but I hated the editing, continuity and aspecially the inserts. I know it's made 100 years ago but most films made don't have those issues.The story was nice and the actors were okay."], "tt0013579": ["This had been something of a holy grail for me: while there's very little that's actually written about it (even following this DVD release from Kino - I came across only 1 online review!), its reputation as a highpoint of the German Expressionist movement had always preceded it and I had personally been intrigued for years by a single still from the film in the British periodical from the early 80s, \"The Movie\".Well, having at long last watched the film (thanks, Kino, also the 'rescuers' of another rare Silent classic - Paul Leni's THE MAN WHO LAUGHS [1928]), I can say that it's a genuine masterwork which well and truly belongs with the other classics of the early German cinema (particularly the Expressionist horror films, even if WARNING SHADOWS is not a genre effort per se). Still, there are undeniable macabre overtones in the story about a dinner party comprising a jealous man, his flirtatious wife and her four suitors that's 'invaded' by the owner of a traveling puppet-show who may or may not be a magician as well.Actually, the film looks forward to several others in its theme and approach: first of all, its complete lack of intertitles (this is a purely visual film) precedes F.W. Murnau's more celebrated THE LAST LAUGH (1924), the silhouetted puppet show anticipates Lotte Reiniger's THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED (1926; the first 'animated' film) and the 'film-within-a-film' scenario (where we have the magician 'borrowing' the shadows of the guests in order to allow them to see for themselves what is to be the tragic outcome of the night) also looks forward to a similar 'morality play' performance at the centre of another Murnau film, TARTUFFE (1925)!As I said, the film's look - sets by Albin Grau and camera-work by Fritz Arno Wagner (both of whom had worked on Murnau's NOSFERATU [1922]) - and the techniques deployed - particular attention is given to the lighting scheme as, in the absence of dialogue, this functions as much as an illumination of the various characters and what they may be thinking as the actors interpreting them! - are incredible (even after all these years): the plot itself is very simple and, in fact, if the film has a fault it's that it takes this a bit too slowly; all the various characters are introduced at the very start in a prologue which occupies the first five minutes of the picture! Then again, by the time the magician's terrifying and murderous visions had reached their crescendo (this here is, by far, the best section of the film), I had become so completely absorbed that I was actually surprised when the picture shifted back to the main narrative, indicating that it was nearing conclusion!As befits an Expressionist film, the acting style (but also the make-up) is slightly exaggerated with the result that some of it may seem awkward today (the leading lady and the three elderly suitors, for instance). Much better are the three more notable names in the cast - Fritz Kortner as the husband, Gustav von Wangeheim (who had been Jonathan Harker in NOSFERATU) as the infatuated youth and especially Alexander Granach (yet another NOSFERATU alumnus, where he had made a creepy Renfield) as the scruffy-looking and somewhat unhinged magician; indeed, the latter makes for a truly memorable character - and I could just imagine him going to the next house or the next village after the end of our story to provide some more of his specialized 'entertainment'!The figure of director Arthur Robison, then, is something of an enigma: he was an American who ended up working in Germany; I haven't seen any of his other work and doubt how much of it actually survives at this juncture - but he did contrive to make the original version of THE INFORMER (featuring, apart from a very young Ray Milland, German actors Lars Hanson and Lya De Putti!) in Britain in 1929, while in 1935 came his remake of the oft-filmed German folktale THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE, starring the great Anton Walbrook in the famous dual role...", "This is an unusual, very different sort of film, completely visual as it has no intertitles, in keeping with the original German version. About a man who is full of anxiety (his eyes continually popping out in jealous rages) over the attentions his woman has been paying to a handsome youth and several other male admirers (meanwhile, though she likes to flirt, she actually seems more interested in gazing at herself and posing in front of mirrors). The action all takes place at a house dinner party one evening, where our beautiful and alluring peacock lady is busy enticing the man, the youth, and three gentlemen, then all are \"entertained\" by a strange traveling entertainer and his shadow puppet play, who causes all to hallucinate a vision of \"things to come\".This film is very interestingly photographed, full of sharp shadows against brightly lit walls that set some of the action, plus lavish period costuming and well-draped sets that look like they belong on a stage. The action is mostly slow and dreamlike, a bit too slow at times as this drags just a little through parts. Still, very interesting to see. The print on the DVD, tinted in sepia/yellow, pink, and bright lavender tones, looks quite nice. The music score is excellent and suits this very odd silent film quite well.", "To enjoy this film -- and you can -- accept the fact that the characters take their time in expressing themselves in mostly slow, but sometimes abrupt motions. Give up the idea of \"Get on with it!\" and accept the slow pace. It's worth it; just let yourself be drawn into a world of shadows, dreams and mesmerism.At a dinner party, a shadow player entertains a count, his flirtatious wife, and four of her admirers. He appears to entrance them into a weird dream in which the suddenly cuckolded husband has the three suitors kill his wife. This is enough of a spoiler, since you could probably guess watching it that something was going to happen to her because of her outlandish flirtations with those fawning over her (or perhaps, as another noted above, she was more in love with herself than with others). Finally, the party goers watch the ending of their dream on a screen in front of them, the curtains close over it, and they wake up. The husband and wife reunite, now deeply in love, seeing the folly of their past ways.What makes the film stand out are (surprise!) the extensive and creative use of shadows, the slightly bizarre story, which definitely cries out for a remake, and some outstanding camera work, even if this is the kind of German Expressionism Mike 'Deiter' Myers used to satirize on the 'Sprockets' segment on 'Saturday Night Live' in the 1990s.We don't get the herky-jerky motions so common in comedies of the teen years, or as seen in the great 'Intolerance' (1916), or the amazing 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (1920), but we see more naturalistic (24 frames?) movement, even if it's all too stagy. It has a good, well fitting score. If you want good, fluid movements, with an interesting story and not very stagy acting, check out 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' (1921) or any of so many other great films of the twenties.This one is innovative, ground breaking, enjoyable film making. I give it a 7.", "\"Warning Shadows\" shouldn't work as well as it does. There are no titles, causing the plot to be confusing if not closely paid attention to; the Expressionistic elements are abundant but also strangely removed in style; the acting is often tongue-in-cheek, and the overall artiness is seemingly self-conscious. However, those same elements also contribute to this film's majesty and originality. There is simply no other film (that I'm aware of, anyway) that approaches the beauty and sheer erotic oddness of this obscure classic. I cannot adequately describe exactly what it is that makes \"Warning Shadows\" one of my all-time favorite motion pictures, so...just see it. It's available on DVD from our great friends at Kino.", "For further reading I recommend an excellent article on the film in the film magazine 'Traffic' (nb. 33) by the German movie aficionado Enno Patalas. Patalas was also the driving force behind a complete restoration of the film at the Munich Filmmuseum - surprisingly there are some (hand- )colored sections in the original version. The shadow theater puppets shown in the movie were created by the German expressionist artist Ernst Moritz Engert, who was well connected to the early expressionist art- and literature-scene in Berlin and Munich. I adore the movie for exploring the deep aesthetic relations between the art of the shadow play and movie as an art itself - from my point of view the earliest and most reflected approach to provide a genuine philosophical statement on film.", "German Expressionism was a style of filmmaking that seemed loaded with potential, especially after the early success of The Cabinet of Caligari. The idea of the movement was that the filmmakers would make the sets reflect the interior state of the characters, which is a neat way to get around the seeming perspective limitation of cinema when compared to literature. In practice, however, Caligari has remained pretty much the only famous film to do this successfully and consistently in spite of the utilization of this technique in very small measures in several films of the period, most famously in those of Murnau and Lang.I was hoping that the relatively obscure Warning Shadows (aka Schatten - Eine n\u00e4chtliche Halluzination) might be another film that took full advantage of what I see as the great potential of this movement but I was somewhat disappointed to see that it uses it minimally. First of all, in spite of a couple of cues that suggest a good deal of the film isn't quite real or even that it's all the dream of a character, this idea is never fully developed so there really isn't a specific interior state to reflect. Even if you work with the assumption that the film doesn't represent any specific perspective but is meant to look like a dream, the set design is still lacking because it just seems like a staged mockup of a large manor house. In fact, for a film that foregoes dialogue and intertitles altogether, Warning Shadows is surprisingly stagy and the rooms seem artificial in a bad way, especially since it isn't common to see more than one wall at a time here.The plot and its execution is solid but unremarkable. The film is about a very jealous man who has invited four amorous young men to have dinner with him and his coquettish wife. It's obvious where this is headed all along, although things are complicated by the presence of an entertainer who can do amazing things with shadow puppets. He uses these puppets to show what might happen if the young men don't cool their heels around the jealous husband. This is a simple plot that is still somewhat hard to follow because of the lack of dialogue and is further complicated by the languorous pace. On the bright side, the entertainer character seems to be a neat variation on the supernatural trickster archetype.Anyway, the highlight here is still the visuals, especially the warning shadows themselves. There's something inherently creepy about shadows and especially a mysterious person who can manipulate them for reasons of his own and even though he ultimately turns out to be relatively benevolent the film still manages to pull of a few unsettling sequences. Further, there are a couple of scenes in which the characters' behavior is odd in a way that calls dreams to mind, so this isn't just your run of the mill tale of jealousy. I also have to give the film some credit for relying so much on visuals and the last scene is suitably bizarre. Overall, Warning Shadows is a worthwhile watch that doesn't quite live up some of its more famous predecessors.", "Shadows are used to add distinction to a simple melodrama, in which four men try to seduce their host's flirtatious wife, introducing a gallery of different ways of using shadows for dramatic or storytelling purpose. However, I found the resource too distancing, especially the use the art of Chinese shadows to narrate a long tale that forces us viewers to relate representational metaphors to the actual story we are watching, as the play within the play in \"Hamlet\". In this case, the Chinese images are not clearly defined, and the filmmakers decided not to use intertitles... Add that wigs, costumes and sets are not particularly impressive, so there you have. A good try, but not as clear or clever as other German Expressionist movies.", "Ruth Weyher (the super-lovely wife), Fritz Kortner (the super-jealous husband), Fritz Rasp (the personal servant), Karl Platen (another servant), Lilli Herder (the maid), Alexander Granach (the strange illusionist), Eugen Rex (servant), Gustav von Wangenheim (the lover), Rudolf Klein-Rogge, Max Gulstorf, Ferdinand von Alten (older admirers).Director: ARTHUR ROBISON.

German release: 16 October 1923. New York opening at the 55th Street Cinema: 9 August 1927. 85 minutes. (DVD available from Kino. Quality rating: 9 out of ten).COMMENT: A masterpiece of German expressionist cinema or a boring charade? Critics are not evenly divided. Most opt for the first scenario. Me? I stand in the middle.\"Warning Shadows\" is the sort of film that seems better in one's memory of tinted shadowy highlights than in an actual viewing where larger-than-life acting (particularly the over-the-top, bulging-eyed Kortner) is much less acceptable.", "This is \"Schatten - Eine n\u00e4chtliche Halluzination\" or \"Warning Shadows\" and this film takes a path that many silent films back then. Include an ounce of horror, mystery, maybe even fantasy and hope the audience will be scared. Well.. maybe back then they were, but today this film that runs for slightly under 85 minutes did almost nothing for me. The usual problem is present again: not enough subtitles. If we don't understand what is going on, we lose interest and don't care about the story or characters. I really wonder why so few directors included a sufficient amount of subtitles during the silent film era. I guess there is a reason why nobody knows Arthur Robison today anymore, the writer and director of this German movie here. Another problem is overacting. Especially, the male protagonist who is also in the last scene really needed a lesson in subtlety. So yeah, a weak film with regard to basically everything: story, acting and directing. I do not recommend this over 90-year-old film. Not dramatic, not entertaining and especially not scary. Thumbs down.", "One of the most influential of the German Expressionist films of the 1920's. The most radical aspect is the lighting, where the shadows are sometimes more important than the actors.Also unusual is that there are no titles except at the start to introduce the characters, who are just types and do not have names, just descriptive titles (husband, wife, youth, servant, etc.).The shadow puppet show is similar to what is seen more extensively in Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed, Die (1925).", "I shudder to think what might have been of the German school if Caligari and Nosferatu had been among the lost films. There's just not a whole lot that has reached us from this movement, much less truly great works. Recently restored by the Murnau foundation, this is meant to be one of the most evocative ones, a great title we had been missing.Most of it passes with little notice, a night of erotic angst, rivalry and a marriage falling apart with the lavish mansion of a baron as the stage of the theater. The prospective lovers feign and thrust, eventually really thrust; we get to see this in shadows. Shadows, a nocturnal hallucination as the title goes. It's the arrival of a shadow-player that is the most intriguing here. Oh, eventually his magick tricks were all serving a benign purpose, domestic bliss is salvaged from desire most foul, the soul restored into proper order.The trick is that he gives the parties involved a vision of what might unfold, the dangers involved. His small audience wakes up from the cinematic illusion dazzled, baffled, rubbing their eyes with disbelief. And we pull further back in the final shot to see curtains falling on this level that we experienced as reality.Is everything inside the nested story so artificial because it was the times still inflected by theater, or because the shadow play is inherently artificial? Is the shadow player the protagonist himself, made from his mirrored image, and so conjuring for himself a wish-fulfillment illusion where everything is made alright?If you were looking to come to this for German expressionism, you might want to reconsider. There is a great shot of the illusionist pushing back, elongating the shadows of his players. But it's serving and is part of the great self-referential tradition of cinema, films about the illusion of watching films.", "I'm a passionate advocate on behalf of German Expressionist films, especially from the silent era. I'm still bitter about an incident at the 1982 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago, when an audience full of idiots (jaded by high-tech S/FX movies) laughed at the cardboard sets in 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'. Those morons didn't care that the high degree of originality and imagination in 'Caligari' more than made up for its tiny production budget.'Shadows', however, while firmly within the Expressionist genre, is too arty for its own good. While this film does have some merits, its flaws greatly outnumber and exceed its merits.All the actors perform their roles with hand-to-brow histrionics of precisely the sort which have given silent-film acting a bad reputation. Several of the actors in this movie have given good performances elsewhere, so I assume that director Arthur Robison deserves the blame for their mannered theatrics here. During one scene, when a swain aims a punch at his rival, the actor cannot simply throw a punch: he must put his fist up against the other man's face, and then shove.Alexander Granach, as a showman with a shadow box and shadow puppets, demonstrates some extremely deft hand shadows, apparently with no other props supplementing his hands. But, when the puppet-master isn't performing, Granach lurches across the screen like Igor the hunchback. Ruth Weyher is pretty and graceful but is given no opportunity to behave like a human being.This silent film was originally released with no intertitles. Several other silent features also eschewed captions -- 'The Last Laugh', \"The Old Swimmin' Hole\", 'The Last Moment' -- but those films had linear plots which the audience could easily follow. The plot of 'Shadows' is deeply confusing, made even more confusing by the arty pretensions, and the story would have been far easier to follow with some captions. A curator at the Murnau Archiv has told me that 'Shadows' was given intertitles by several exhibitors when it was released outside Germany.The plot -- such as it is -- vaguely reminded me of Renoir's 'Rules of the Game' and Bergman's 'Smiles of a Summer Night': in a swank country manor, some people with more money than sense amuse themselves at each other's expense. But here the cast members are introduced in arty tableaux that are more alienating than edifying. After the final tableau, we're treated to the odd spectacle of a single upraised finger casting a shadow on the screen. What does this mean, please? Later, in hindsight, we understand that this signifies the beginning of the drama's Chapter One. (I saw this film in London, where the audience burst out laughing at the start of Chapter Two, symbolised by a hand with TWO upraised fingers: in Britain, this two-fingered gesture has obscene connotations.) The finger device is confusing, and adds nothing to the story ... nor does the decision to divide the narrative into arbitrary chapters.The production design is impressive: judging by the furniture and clothes, this story takes place somewhere in Europe (probably Germany) circa 1830: again, some titles would have helped. But Robison considerably weakens the effect of these wonderful costumes and sets by obscuring them with elaborate shadows, and by gimmicky effects such as raising and lowering a proscenium curtain in front of the actors. (As if we need to be reminded that this very artificial story is merely a story!)Considerable talent, effort and expense were put into 'Shadows', to little effect. Rather a lot of today's movie-goers are sadly prejudiced against silent films, misperceiving them all to be crude and laughably overacted. Sadly, 'Shadows' is precisely the sort of movie which would convince such people that all the negative stereotypes about silent movies are true after all. My rating for this failure: 2 out of 10, mostly for the production design.", "Have you ever gone to a country where you don't know the language and sat and listened to what was going on around you? If so, then you might have some idea what it's like watching \"Warning Shadows\". All sorts of things happen on the screen but the viewer is left wondering what this all means--and there is no explanation nor context nor any intertitle cards explaining anything. While I noticed a lot of people gave this one 9s and 10s, I just can't see it as the film seemed boring and incomprehensible.Normally in a review I talk a bit about the plot, but in this one I have no idea WHAT is going on. There are a lot of men wearing early 19th century clothing and they all hang about a woman in a strange mansion. Periodically, they amuse themselves with shadow plays projected on sheets. What else is occurring? I dunno.\"Warning Shadows\" has been described as an example of German Expressionism--the same odd sort of style typified in \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\". However, \"The Cabinet\" is a wonderful film and uses it's odd surreal look to the fullest. Here in \"Warning Shadows\" the sets just come off as simple or cheap. Additionally, I'd prefer to think of it as German OVER-expressionism because the acting is so overdone. Characters roll their eyes, stare and make a billion and one expressions using their eyes as well as wildly gesticulating to show emotions. Arty? I dunno--it just looks bad.Aside from some nice costumes, I cannot find much of anything to admire about this film. While I have seen and reviewed hundreds (if not thousands) of silents and greatly appreciate them, this film seems like an artsy-fartsy mess--and a dull one to boot.", "During a dinner, given by a wealthy baron and his wife, attended by four of her suitors in a 19th century German manor, a shadow-player rescues the marriage by giving all the guests a vision what might happen tonight if the baron stays jealous and the suitors do not reduce their advances towards his beautiful wife.What strikes me about this film is just how German it is. I have no idea what was going on in Germany in the 1920s, but they had a definite vision on how to use shadows and light in their films. While this is not German expressionism, it is not so far removed that we cannot see the German aesthetic.In some ways, we might be better comparing this to \"Prince Achmed\", a cartoon that relied on shadows rather than drawing. Again, a German film. I am surprised by how much a country's boundary could define their films. Today, I do not feel that a film made in any one country is so obviously differently from another...", "I caught this at the Cinematheque a couple of times in Paris. It is a film with no intertitles (except at the beginning for identifying the characters) and, like \"The Last Laugh\", depends on the camera and editing to tell the story. The action in both films, then, would have to be slow as not to confuse the viewer. This is the lesser of the two but the Murnau film has long been an established masterwork. Frankly I don't know much about Art(h)ur Robison. He was an American working on German-looking films in Germany during the Expressionist phase.This film does indeed feature shadows and the lighting is necessarily bright. What I particularly enjoyed was being pulled into the action of the shadows along with the guests. In this respect the film was quite brilliant. The acting is really quite good and despite the slow speed of action, the film has barely dated at all.Curtis Stotlar", "German expressionism is on display in this strange drama from director Arthur Robison. A rich aristocrat (Fritz Kortner) invites some other dilettantes over for an evening of entertainment. The aristocrat sees the silhouette of what appears to be his lascivious wife (Ruth Wyher) being sexually groped by the trio of guests. This understandably upsets the aristocrat, and things aren't helped by his mischievous butler (Fritz Rasp) who feeds into his paranoia. When the night's entertainment shows up, he's a Shadowplayer (Alexander Granach), meaning he uses shadows and shadow puppets to tell tales. His performance causes everyone present to consider their actions.The highlights here are the numerous inventive ways shadows are used to tell the story, and Rasp as the evil butler. He's long been a favorite of mine among German character actors, and I loved seeing this early role for him. .", "As the story unfolds, a night of entertainment slowly transforms into a nightmare of insane jealousy, violence, and death. Or does it?Enchanting, fascinating, and oddly macabre, WARNING SHADOWS uses light and dark to explore human nature. The use of shadow by candlelight -whether through silhouettes, shadow puppets, or shadow / mirror images- is striking.This is another silent, expressionistic masterpiece.

These tend to be a bit difficult to find if they're not the bigger titles from that decade. I did find this on YouTube as it appears that there might be a restoration out there. Other than the year it came out and the year it came out, I came into this one blind.Synopsis: a wealthy man invites the local wealthy bachelors over for a puppet show about men who covet another man's wife. The puppeteer is a witch and gives the men nightmares about what could happen if they date the lady of the house.Since I came in with limited knowledge, it is funny that I tried to watch this movie late at night and couldn't get into it. I restarted it a couple nights later and it made a bit more sense. The version that I watched was set up like the original German version where there are no title cards. This makes it easier since there's no reading. It also makes it more difficult as you must pay attention to each scene and figure out what they're conveying through body language.I did pick up on the fact that we have this traveling entertainer, Alexander Granach. He sees the house that belongs to Fritz Kortner and his wife Ruth Weyher. We see that he's madly in love with her, where she might not reciprocate. The husband has invited someone credited as youth, Gustav von Wangenehim. There are also three gentlemen that are invited: Eugen Rex, Max G\u00fclstorff and Ferdinand von Alten.What I didn't realize is that the traveling entertainer was invited. It seems more like him forcing his way inside from what I saw. It is from there that he catches the interest of the group and puts on a show. It is quite amazing what he can do with his hands and puppets. He uses shadows to do different things, hence the name. It takes a dark turn though when everyone falls asleep.That is where I'm going to leave my recap as there isn't a lot to the story. Even though this movie is now 100 years old, I don't gain anything by revealing where it goes. What I do have to say is that I'm not always the biggest fan of what they do here. Since this movie is so early into cinema, it won't be anything that I hold against it. I do think that this is an interesting way to present the events of what we get here.Now if you couldn't tell from the synopsis and what I've laid out, this is a cautionary tale to not covet your neighbor's wife. Ruth doesn't seem to love her husband as much as he loves her. I got that before the show began. Where things end up is interesting. I'm assuming that what they saw made her change her ways. Gustav is a youth that she has interest in. That doesn't show itself until the traveling entertainer arrives if memory serves. This is still an idea though that is relevant today with different things both in the horror genre and not.Something else that I didn't necessarily know was that the traveling entertainer was a 'witch'. That seems to be a term they're using here since he does something that is supernatural. Everyone falls asleep, but I wasn't sure if it was his show that caused that or if was a drink that everyone had. Regardless, I did find it interesting that his early in cinema we are seeing a meta-approach. The show that he is doing with the shadow puppets is literally telling the same story as what we are getting just on a smaller scale. I did find that to be an interesting approach, especially since meta became so popular in the 2000s and beyond.What carries this though is the acting. Since we don't have dialogue or title cards, it is all on their shoulders. What is interesting as well is that they don't go over the top. The performances are grounded. I figured out what needed to be conveyed just from their facial expressions and body language. Kortner is good as this 'older' man who is married and I'd say that Weyher is good as his wife. What is interesting is that her and von Wangenheim are what cause all the issues here. He is also good as this 'younger' man. I also like Rex, G\u00fclstorff and von Alten as the guests to the party. I should give credit to Granach as well as Fritz Rasp, Karl Platen and Lilli Herder. This last trio are the servants/maid. The acting here is good.Then all that is left would be with the filmmaking. I'd say that this cinematography is fine. We get a lot of stationary camera shots, but that is just due to when it was made. What we got there looked good. I had no issues. What impressed me though were the shadow puppets. I'm guessing some of this are in camera effects. Regardless, I liked it. It is something you do as a kid so seeing how advanced the traveling entertainer is with it is fun. Other than that, the soundtrack fit for what was needed. It is hard to tell if this was originally synced with it. There are sound effects to match what is happening on screen which is a good touch for a silent film.In conclusion, this is a solid piece of early cinema. I like this cautionary tale that goes back to the bible. There aren't title cards or dialogue so I credit the acting to carry this movie. I got most of what was happening here just through their facial expressions and their body language. That isn't easy to do. There is a story element that I'm not overly fond of anymore. It works in the confines here of when this was made though. This is well-made just in general from the cinematography to the soundtrack. Won't be for everyone. I can only recommend this to those out to see the early history of the film or the horror genre.My Rating: 7 out of 10.", "Germans after The Great War were a disillusioned lot: supporting and fighting for what they were told was a great ideal, most found out the country's end goals weren't what the military had promised. Its artists, particularly in expressionistic cinema, found that appearances to the naked eye were really something different when examining their deep, underlying truths.In Arthur Robison's written and directed work, October 1923's \"Warning Shadows,\" or its German title aptly named 'Shadows-a Nocturnal Hallucination,' the film is one of the most German Expressionistic film a viewer can find. The movement reached its heights in 1920 with 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,' but the art was still popular in 1923 when cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner, who worked alongside director F. W. Murnau and his 1922 'Nosferatu,' designed a heavy layer of dark shadows and a strong dose of chiaroscuro lighting to create a dreamy, if bizarre world of the subconscious dominating the action of a dinner party's hosts and guests in a social setting. The unnatural world of expressionism, with its jarring acting style and exhibiting the darker impulses in ordinary people, was predominant in 1920s German cinema, but none so much as \"Warning Shadows.\"\nA flirtatious wife, a jealous husband, four bold guests, young admirers of the wife, two servants and an entertainer who loves to shake up people's minds, all combine for a highly charged evening. The mischievous entertainer, using shadows to express submergible meanings, pulls the entire party at the table into a nether world of each one's thoughts and desires. The group as well as the servants enact a wish-fulfillment on the wife, who suddenly realizes all her cloying seductiveness does have its consequences.What's remarkable of \"Warning Shadows\" is the entire movie, save for the characters' introduction, is told without one inter-title. Wagner felt these title cards were boring and destroyed the continuity of a film. Filmmakers at this period in cinema were aware of the problem and tried to minimize, and even attempted to eliminate these descriptive and dialogue titles."], "tt0014142": ["A very good version of the classic story from the silent era of movie making. The highlight of the movie is clearly Lon Chaney's performance as Quasimodo, the hideously deformed resident of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris in the 15th century. One first has to offer kudos for the superb makeup. Chaney is completely unrecognizable in this role. Director Wallace Worsley does a good job of building up sympathy for the Hunchback throughout, and the image of Chaney gleefully swinging off the rope to ring Notre Dame's bells is one that will stay with anyone who has ever seen this film.Although Quasimodo is the title character, much of the story actually revolves around Esmeralda, who is the object of the affection (some romantic, some fraternal) of almost every male character in the story. The role is played superbly by Patsy Ruth Miller, who possesses both a beauty and an innocence that fit the character perfectly.Director Worsley also does a marvelous job of creating a dark and ominous feeling around the Paris of that era, as tension between the social classes rises. Ernest Torrence is especially convincing as Clopin, the \"King of the Poor\" in Paris, and foster-father to Esmeralda, who feels betrayed when Esmeralda falls in love with a member of the nobility (an \"aristocrat\" as Clopin contemptuously calls him.)The movie suffered a little bit from what I found at times to be a less than appropriate musical score, and the quality of the film is not especially good (at least when I saw it) but that is hardly surprising given its age. Overall, though, this is a very interesting film that easily holds a viewers' attention.8/10", "Deaf and half-blind, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, feared & rejected by the people of Paris, becomes the unlikely protector of a poor gypsy girl.Lon Chaney, master of disguise, solidified his celebrity with his portrayal of Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer, who is forever cut off from any semblance of a normal life. Although his makeup is certainly horrific, Chaney's role is not really monstrous: he is a lonely human desperately misused by Fate. Chaney's face speaks for him, communicating the tormenting anguish of his soul. While not quite as poignant as Charles Laughton's interpretation 16 years later, Chaney still makes of the role a Silent hallmark which has stood the test of time.There are fairly lengthy segments in which Chaney does not appear and plot elements not explored in the longer Laughton version. Here the story dwells on the gypsy dancer Esmeralda, played by Patsy Ruth Miller, and her burgeoning romance with the brave Phoebus, Captain of the Guard, played by Norman Kerry. Both performers do very well with their 'normal' roles -- her innocence contrasting well with his initial lust -- even though the viewer is doubtless anxious for the return of the Hunchback.A handful of excellent character actors from the era add their assistance: gaunt Nigel de Brulier as the saintly Archdeacon, defender of the Hunchback; beefy Ernest Torrence as Clopin, King of Thieves, ruling over the Court of Miracles; prissy Raymond Hatton as the effete poet Gringoire; and feeble Tully Marshall as a suspicious Louis XI.Special mention must be made of Universal's splendid attention to detail which they lavished on the film. Most especially commendable is the representation of Notre Dame's West Facade, the only real angle from which the Cathedral's exterior is depicted. To see Chaney clamber down, swinging from pinnacle to gargoyle to statue; or, to watch Quasimodo defend Esmeralda from the crowd of beggars he thinks has come to kill her, dropping stones, beams and molten metal on their heads below from the Cathedral's ramparts, is to enjoy two of Silent Cinema's great visual moments.", "This classic silent version of the often-filmed story of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" features good atmosphere and one of Lon Chaney's many fine renderings of an unusual character. Between Chaney and the ponderous medieval settings, it really seems like a strange and unusual world. The rest of the cast helps out as well, and makes this version well worth seeing despite the many newer adaptations that have had the advantages of later technologies.Chaney is ideal for this kind of role, since he not only creates an interesting and suitable look for the character, but also conceives of the right gestures and expressions to make the character come alive. On the silent screen, Chaney was able to portray characters like Quasimodo and the Phantom with a believability and humanity that few of today's actors can even approach, much less surpass, despite all of their advantages.While Chaney is the main highlight, the rest of this production works well also. The portrayal of the Parisian underworld, the atmosphere in the great cathedral, and the portrayals of most of the main characters are also strengths. Among the supporting cast, Patsy Ann Miller as Esmerelda and Ernest Torrance as Clopin are particularly good. It fits together well, and creates a satisfying version of the classic story.", "This early version of the legendary story is (so far) the oldest film I've ever seen. Personally, I find it fascinating to purchase movies made before my grandparents were even born. The entire concept of cinema as a form of art is scarcely out of the egg it all still looks so grotesque. I did learn something from this film\u0085these ancient milestones aren't necessarily brilliant but impressive beyond belief. The Hunchback of the Notre Dame often gets referred to as one of the first \u0091horror' classics but much more than that, it's a historical spectacle with massive sets and groundbreaking elements. The actual plot is so easy to summarize but you get so much more than that! Like a very detailed and imaginative portrait of Paris in the 15th century, the variety of social classes and an idea of medieval interpretation of the law. At some times in this film, you almost get the idea Quasimodo and Esmeralda are just second-class puppets in what is primarily a historical and educating documentary. Magnificent without a single doubt\u0085but time-consuming and ponderous to sit through\u0085Although, I have to say I hunt down the extended version, furnished with a stained musical track and lasting 140 minutes.The actual plot and the presentation of Quasimodo's personality is still unparalleled and touching beyond comparison. Lon Chaney is simply outstanding as the unworldly and deformed \u0091freak' who's willing to sacrifice his life unconditionally to rescue the girl who once treated him in a human way. He might be hideous, but he's the only who's pure, honest and free of prejudices. Lon Chaney's facial make-up and hunch are early horror triumphs. Along with his natural charismatic appearance, the Quasimodo portrayal provided Chaney with the immortal status of horror-cinema icon. Even though he already starred in over a hundred films before The Hunchback, he'll always be remembered starting from this point of his career. Like none other actor, Chaney gave a face to Quasimodo and that is not exaggerated! Multiple other well-respected actors gave image to Quasimodo after Chaney (like Charles Laughton, Anthony Quinn and Anthony Hopkins) but only he will truly be remembered for it. Same goes for Lon's personification of Erik in `Phantom of the Opera' which is his greatest achievement in cinema along with Hunchback.The Hunchback of the Notre Dame is over eighty (80!) years old now and it still stands as one of the most overwhelming heavyweights in cinema ever. Some of the sequences shown here are pure mythical inheritance. Like Chaney acrobatic movements while tolling the massive bells\u0085or his descent off the Notre Dame's walls! Still, this film might not be for all tastes as it's too bombastic all together and Woresly's direction is kind of rough and ponderous. He surely put too much energy in it, as it was the most ambitious project of his career. Therefore, it's hard to stay focused continuously as the shots of Medieval Parisian streets seem to be endless", "It's hard to rate this film. Much of this is because the film has been floating around for years and is available in many forms--some longer and some significantly shorter. I have a videotape version that only runs about 90 minutes and it lacks any musical score. The version I just saw on TCM lasted almost two hours and had a very good musical score by Robert Israel. However, despite the excellent score he recently wrote for the film, the print itself was in pretty poor shape--looking like it needed further restoration. The review I am giving is for this longer version with music.The film was exceptional from a technical standpoint. There were huge numbers of extras, very impressive sets that make you think it was really filmed in Paris and the acting was very good. Not surprisingly, Lon Chaney was exceptional and his makeup very convincing. However, despite the technical merit, I still found myself preferring his PHANTOM OF THE OPERA--it was a more interesting story and has been completely restored, so it is a visual treat--unlike HUNCHBACK. Also, the story itself never seemed super-compelling. A good chance I feel this way is that I have seen at least five different versions of the story and it just feels a bit old. So I really can't blame THIS film--it's more a case of \"burnout\". Still, it's an amazing film and not to be missed by silent movie fans.", "THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (Universal, 1923), directed by Wallace Worsley, takes an important step in cinema history. While Victor Hugo's classic novel, published in the 1830s, had been transferred to the screen on several occasions prior to this 1923 adaptation, one of mention titled THE DARLING OF Paris (Fox, 1917) featuring Theda Bara, this production ranks one of the first lavish spectacles Universal had produced thus far, as well as a truly challenging performance for Lon Chaney (1883-1930) in the role of the deformed bell-ringer named Quasimodo. Remade several times thereafter, with the most famous being the 1939 adaptation starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara for RKO Radio (interestingly not by Universal!), no two versions are exactly alike. In fact, the more recent adaptation transferred to the screen became the 1996 feature length animation musicalized version, but many of the remakes then and now do owe a lot to Chaney's artistic achievement of long ago.Set in fifteenth century Paris, Quasimodo \"deaf, half blind\", is a deformed soul attending the gathering of the Festival of Fools. Among the celebrants are Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller), a gypsy girl, \"a child of mystery,\" who enters the city of Notre Dame and dances for the crowd, and Gringoire (Raymond Hatton), a poet-playwright attempting to act out his allegorical play with little success. The crowd encounters the hideous face of Quasimodo, and instantly acclaimed him as the King of the Fools. Normally regarded a monster, Quasimodo has his moment of glory becoming the center of attention before Dom Claude (Nigel De Brullier), the saintly priest, has him return with him to the cathedral. The evil Jehan (Brandon Hurst), has one thing in mind, his lust for the gypsy girl. He sends Quasimodo to abduct her, as witnessed by Phoebus (Norman Kerry), a captain of the guards (\"men yielded to his sword, and women to his smile\"), rescuing her from the hunchback. After Quasimodo's capture and punishment through flogging, it is Esmeralda, no longer fearing him, to grant him his request for water. Jehan continues his abduction plot on Esmeralda, but because of her love for Phoebus, makes her the accused and sentenced through execution for the stabbing of Phoebus, leading Quasimodo to repay the favor by coming to Esmeralda's aide.The other members of the cast of thousands include: Ernest Torrence (Clopin, \"King of the beggars, enemy of the king\" and Esmeralda's \"foster father\"); Tully Marshall (King Louis XI, \"whose dungeons are always full, whose executioners always kept busy\"); Kate Lester (Mademoiselle de Gondelaurier); and Gladys Brockwell (Godule, the mysterious reclusive woman who feels gypsies \"should all be cursed\").With Chaney's many early screen performances starting in 1914, along with hundreds of characters and thousands of faces, he actually didn't reach true star prominence until after achieving the kind of success long overdue him with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. In spite of his feature billing, grotesque makeup and sympathetic gestures, Chaney's participation in this production is actually a supporting one. Much has been written about Chaney's makeup, a misshapen face with an eye that droops almost out of its socket, mouth with jagged teeth and twisted legs, wavy hair, but it's his character behind that makeup who really brings out his sympathy and human dignity. Not essentially a horror film, but rather a love story of two misunderstood characters, the hunchback and the gypsy girl. Unlike Victor Hugo's novel, this screen version details very little about Quasimodo's background, yet, spends more time bringing out the true heritage of Esmeralda. This carefully constructed production captures the simplicity of 19th century Paris, from the authentic Notre Dame cathedral down to the costumes, making this one a true classic of the silent screen.THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1925) remain two of Lon Chaney's most famous screen roles. During the early years of video cassette distributions, these two silent features, which have become public domain titles, were the easiest to obtain. Released through various distributors means alternate versions, ranging from bad video transfers with no musical scoring, to clear picture quality with various types of underscoring, ranging from organ to orchestral, with the majority with the average time frame from 97 to 123 minutes. Blackhawk Video's version contained a Lee Irwin orchestral score with flute sounds, ringing church bells and cathedral chanting. Republic Home Video, along Critic's Choice contained organ scores, color tints and new title cards for its opening introduction. The only debit with Republic's home video transfer is having the final scene as Quasimodo ringings the church bell of Notre Dame for the last time, abruptly ending in freeze frame as the priest (De Brulier) walks towards him, not showing what follows. The print with the abrupt conclusion was the one used in the 1971 presentation of the 13-week series of THE SILENT YEARS as hosted by Orson Welles on public television. At present, many other video and/ or DVD transfers, do feature the original opening title credits and the complete finish focusing on the bell as it slowly stops swinging back and forth before stopping with the THE END (or rather FIN) title card reaches the screen.THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME occasionally appears on cable television's Turner Classic Movies as part of its weekly Silent Sunday Night presentations hosted by Robert Osborne. Due to a renewed interest into the life and career of Lon Chaney, \"The Man of a Thousand Faces,\" this best known version to the Victor Hugo classic should be the one film to consider and study. (***)", "If I were to say what my favourite versions were, they are the 1939 film with Charles Laughton and the 1996 Disney version. Neither are the most faithful to the book but I found myself to be the most engaged and most moved by them. This 1923 film is very good though. I did think some of the more secondary roles were rather stock here, especially Phoebus and Jehan, but still found the actors adequate. For its time and even now the film is very well made with beautiful(if not quite as Gothic of 1939) cinematography and make-up. The music score is also very good, atmospheric and often haunting, and the story is compelling too. I did find the ending to be of an anti-climax somewhat though, it is much more moving and convincing dramatically in the book and in other versions. The performances are very good on the whole, with Lon Chaney stealing the show as a grotesque and poignant Quasimodo, and Patsy Ann Miller as a beautiful and understated(if perhaps not quite sexy enough) Esmeralda and Ernest Torrance as Clopin faring best in support. All in all, recommended for especially how it was made and for Chaney. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "Wallace Worsley is not a director who usually figures in any lists of Hollywood masters. In fact, Chaney himself (with whom Worsley worked on no less than five pictures-this is the last of them) once described Worsley as little more than \"good as any of the second-raters or better.\" Well Hunchback is certainly better. A whole lot better! A staggeringly spectacular production, its huge crowds and sets are most artistically angled and photographed. If Wallace Worsley was responsible for these consistently pleasing arrangements of light and color, he is indeed a neglected master.\n Ironically, it was due to the fact that he had worked successfully with Chaney at other studios that Worsley was hired in the first place, whereas Chaney's own preference was for Frank Borzage.\n Although Hunchback was a rousing success, Worsley was not offered any more work at Universal. In fact, the studio's publicity department regarded Worsley as such a has-been, they didn't even bother to spell his name correctly on the elaborately colorful posters prepared for the film's general release. (They managed to get Lon Chaney's name right though).\n In 1924, Worsley followed his Hunchback by directing a minor William Farnum/Lois Wilson vehicle, The Man Who Fights Alone, for Paramount. After that little stint, Paramount's publicity manager, B.P. Schulberg-who had Clara Bow under personal contract, plus his own personal production company(!)-releasing through Paramount of course-hired Worsley for The Shadow of the Law, a no-frills quickie that had only two claims to fame: It starred Miss Bow and was photographed by Ray June. And then came Worsley's final movie, appropriately titled The Power of Silence (1928), an out-of-date Belle Bennett silent from Tiffany-Stahl of Poverty Row.\n In addition to his creative visual artistry, Wallace Worsley was also adept at drawing fine performances from his players. Chaney is most effective, Miss Miller utterly charming; while Ernest Torrence, Raymond Hatton and Brandon Hurst almost steal the movie. Tully Marshall would certainly figure on this list too if his role were larger. The only weak spots are Nigel de Brulier, who is mostly quite credible but inclined to overdo the dramatics at times, and Norman Kerry who yet makes his hero considerably less abysmal here than his later effort in Phantom of the Opera.\n However it is not the actors, or even Mr Chaney, who constantly engage our attention. It is the overwhelming sets, filled with merry-making and murderous crowds-the whole medieval milieu in fact that Wallace Worsley brings so forcefully and dramatically to life. \n AVAILABLE on DVD through Image in a beautifully tinted 117-minute print, well-worn in places but always admirably sharp.", "This superior silent movie (even when viewed in a substandard print as the one I saw) blossoms as one of the finest literary adaptations to appear on the screen.Quasimodo, the repulsive deaf hunchback who rings the bells for Notre Dame Cathedral, is played by the multi-faceted Lon Chaney, and he puts the different aspects of the character across very well - fear, hatred, betrayal, longing, kindness. This is a misunderstood 'freak' who has much of the human spirit intact within him despite the betrayals of those who should protect him.Patsy Ruth Miller is an effective Esmeralda, pretty and compelling whether in her gypsy dance or at the finale where she watches the battle between the turrets of the Cathedral and the square below as her people try to battle their way into Sanctuary.Also of note are Nigel de Brulier as Claudio, Ernest Torrence as gypsy king and Esmeralda's foster father Clopin, Tully Marshall as a bored Louis XI, Norman Kerry as a posturing Phoebus, Brandon Hurst as a cunning Jehan, and Raymond Hatton as a twittery Gringoire.There are nice touches in the staging, too - as Esmeralda and Phoebus lunch at an inn, a spider sucks a fly into her web; while the gypsy band at the steps of Notre Dame get showered with a rain of molten lead as Esmeralda hides in safety in the cathedral tower.The version I saw used music and sound effects to accompany the pictures and titles, which was done very well. The film may seem a little long, and could spend more time on Chaney and less on Miss Miller, but it is a good piece of work.", "Let us face it - the 1923 version of THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME is as good in it's way as the 1939 sound version with Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara. The only reason the Laughton version is better recalled now is that it is accessible to Americans born through or after 1927: when movies starting talking. Just like the 1956 version is accessible to people who speak French.But given it is a silent movie, it is remarkably strong work. Chaney's Quasimodo is the most monstrous looking of the personifications of that character (Laughton's make-up is good too, but he somehow seems less frightening). The scene that everyone recalls from this version, of course, is the public whipping scene, when Quasimodo has been captured trying to \"kidnap\" Esmeralda (actually ordered to do that by Frollo) and is whipped. The gypsy takes pity on him and gives him water. It is the point that he starts falling for Esmeralda.Aside from making Phoebus more conventionally heroic (to be with the gypsy at the end), this film gave a memorable death scene to Clopin, dying amidst his beggar army in front of the Cathedral (Ernest Torrence's Clopin gives the role the right degree of gravitas in the face of death). Also, the conclusion wraps up the confusion of the end for the hunchback. Unlike the 1939 ending, which has a sad Laughton bemoaning his perennial lonely state, and the 1956 version which follows the novel in mentioning that years after the execution the skeletons of two people, one deformed, were found in the crypts of the Cathedral, and crumbled into dust together, this one killed off the Hunchback. It was not a bad ending, but at variance with the other two films.", "\"Notre-Dame De Paris\", known in English as \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", is definitely one of the most popular French novels of all time. Written by Victor Hugo, this Gothic tragedy explores many of his favorite themes, including social injustices and romantic idealism. However, the element that is nowadays the most famous trait of the novel, is without a doubt the character of Quasimodo, and the mistreatment he suffers due to his horrible deformities. While Hugo didn't intend this to be the main theme of the novel, the enormous appealing of Quasimodo quickly turned him into the iconic representation of good nature under a monstrous face, and so it is not a surprise that this is also the angle taken by the film adaptations of the novel. In this the first movie version of the immortal novel, the classic role of Quasimodo is performed in film for the first time by another legend, \"The Man of a Thousand Faces\", Lon Chaney Sr.Set in the 15th Century, the movie starts as just another day in the simple life of Quasimodo (Lon Chaney), the bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris who has spend most of his life inside the Cathedral because most people fear his gruesome deformity. Under the care of archdeacon Claude Frollo (Nigel De Brulier), Quasimodo has lived a good, albeit lonely life; however, this is about to change when the archdeacon's brother Jehad (Brandon Hurst), orders Quasimodo to help him to kidnap a young gypsy girl named Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller) that he wants for himself. Jehad's plan fails as Phoebus (Norman Kerry), Captain of the Guards, rescues Esmeralda and takes Quasimodo to prison, however, this will be only the beginning of the tragedy that will unfold under the shadow of the Cathedral of Notre Dame.Adapted by Edward T. Lowe Jr. and Perley Poore Sheehan, the story is really a good adaptation that remains true to the novel's themes of human tragedy despite the fact that the story was significantly simplified. While the focus is certainly on Quasimodo (and he is indeed made a more prominent and sympathetic figure), the screenplay remains an epic tragedy about life and death in Paris, and takes its time to introduce and develop every character, surprisingly including many of the novel's subplots that became forgotten in subsequent versions of the story. The story unfolds nicely and with a good pace, slowly introducing us to the universe of this characters and carefully setting the basis for the climatic finale of the tragedy. Interestingly, despite the changes done to the story, the movie keeps the dark depressing tone of Hugo's Gothic classic.Wallace Worsley may not be a director known for his personal style (the fact that most of his work is lost doesn't help), but he takes on this monumental project with courage and makes this epic tale work nicely. While Worsley was not the first choice to direct the movie, he already had directed Chaney in four movies before this one (including the classic \"The Penalty\"), so being already familiar with Chaney's method of work, Worsley could let him do his thing while he focused on the difficult organization of the complex project. With a cast of thousands and enormous sets, Worsley makes 15th Century Paris to come alive once again and, just like Victor Hugo would wanted, the Cathedral of Notre Dame is made another character of the story thanks to the beautiful cinematography that gives an ominous atmosphere to the building.Lon Chaney is without a doubt the star and highlight of the movie, delivering one of the best performances as Quasimodo (second only to Charles Laughton), and creating one of his most amazing works of make-up. Proving why he is called \"The Man of a Thousand Faces\", Chaney makes a gruesome, yet very expressive \"monster\" that truly conveys the nature of the almost silent character. Patsy Ruth Miller is very effective as Esmeralda, and nicely avoids exaggerated gestures in her dramatic scenes; something that sadly can't be said about Norman Kerry as Phoebus, although being fair, his character is not as developed as the rest. Brandon Hurst is simply amazing, and sometimes even manages to overshadow the enormous Chaney, with a remarkably wicked portrayal of evil in his performance as Jehad. Truly another of the film's highlights.\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" was Universal's most successful film of 1923, and honestly, it's not hard to tell why. Not only Lon Chaney's magnificent performance as Chaney (as well as his outstanding work of make-up) is a true highlight of the film, the lavish sets built for the movie are definitely one of the most amazing works done in silent films, with the reconstruction of Notre Dame's Western facade being extremely detailed and actually very accurate. One would think that given the attention payed to the technical aspects of the film, the performances of the actors were unimportant, but thankfully this is not the case, as Chaney and company proved to be up to the challenge in this movie. As a side note, among the many assistant directors who helped Worsley in this project, there was a young man named William Wyler receiving his first work in the movie industry.Depsite its flaws, this first version of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" remains as one of the best movies of the silent era, and one of the best versions of Victor Hugo's classic. It's probably a bit dated by now, but it still retains the beauty and monumental power of its initial release. Inaugurating the horror genre for Universal Films, this epic tragedy proudly ranks as a classic of the genre and of cinema in general. 8/10", "Victor Hugo's classic \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" receives a grand send-up from Universal Pictures, and superstar Lon Chaney (as Quasimodo). As you might expect, the story is significantly altered from the original. Sex, politics, and religion were then, as well as now, subjects to be treated delicately. The world at large is still waiting for a production that will leave the corpses of Quasimodo and Esmeralda rotting blissfully in Notre Dame. The studio spent a lot of money on this production, and it shows.For decades, Universal literature claimed this film made Mr. Chaney a superstar. Their pride is understandable, but Chaney had already achieved that position. He was a hot property throughout the 1920s. Chaney was responsible for pulling viewers into the cinema for several high-level productions; before his \"Hunchback\" even reared its ugly head, he was sitting comfortably with Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino inside the annual \"Quigley Poll\" of \"Box Office Stars\" (at #9 for the year 1922).Universal added some of the best supporting actors in Hollywood, beautiful Patsy Ruth Miller (as Esmeralda), director Wallace Worsley of Chaney's \"The Penalty\" (1920) to the mix, and spent a fortune on the sets. The result was a crow-pleasing epic. Though retaining its grandeur, this version of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" really does not approach the overall artistic quality of production you can see in other silent films of the era, however. It's enjoyable for those who appreciate the genre, but this \"Hunchback\" can be seen more as a documentation of lavish setting, and for Chaney's towering titular performance.******** The Hunchback of Notre Dame (9/2/23) Wallace Worsley ~ Lon Chaney, Patsy Ruth Miller, Norman Kerry, Ernest Torrance", "\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" is the often filmed Victor Hugo classic tale of the tragic Quasimodo and his love for the lovely Esmeralda in 15th century Paris.Lon Chaney in perhaps his greatest role, plays the title character to perfection. Even through the grotesque make up that he created for the character, he can still elicit the sympathy of the audience through his touching portrayal. Chaney is barely recognizable through the 40 pounds of make up and appliances that went to create Quasimodo for the screen. You have to remember that this was 1923 and Chaney did not have the benefit of today's make up techniques.Patsy Ruth Miller brings youth, beauty and innocence to the role of Esmeralda, a perfect contrast to the hunchback. Norman Kerry plays Phoebus, the nominal hero of the tale who is Esmeralda's true love. Brandon Hurst is the chief villain, Jehan, who wants Esmeralda for himself. Ernest Torrence plays Clopin the \"King of the Beggars\". In the role of Gringoire is Raymond Hatton, who \"B\" western fans will remember as the comical sidekick in several westerns of the 30s and 40s.However, this movie truly belongs to Lon Chaney. It is truly a pity that he died before he could manifest his genius in sound films. (He died in 1930 and made just one sound film).After almost 80 years, Lon Chaney's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" remains the definitive version and a true classic of American cinema.", "When I marathon the Universal Monster movies, this one usually ends up left out. If I was smart, I would say that \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\" isn't a horror film, instead a period melodrama. While Quasimodo is frequently featured next to Frankenstein and Dracula, the film is low on horror content. The truth is I remember disliking the movie and felt no reason to revisit it. Leaving \"Hunchback\" out all-together isn't fair though. After all, \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" wouldn't have happened without it.The movie is beholden to the conventions of Hugo and Laemmle. Despite getting title billing, the hunchback isn't featured in large portions of the film. The gypsy Esmeralda's love affair with the captain of the guard Phoebus takes up half the run-time. Hugo's themes of social unrest take stage in this subplot. Esmeralda's adopted father, Clopin, king of the gypsies, plots revolution against the apathetic king. His daughter falling in love with a noble doesn't sit well with the guy. The themes of the haves versus the have-nots are never more apparent then in the scene where Clopin and his thieves storm Phoebus' party. The poor stand on one side of the ballroom, clothed in rags, the rich on the other, in elegant gowns. Even Quasimodo is a gear in the machine of social hierarchy. The film's villain controls the hunchback. When the gypsy girl flares Frollo's lust, he forces Quasimodo to kidnap her. Caught by the guards, the deformed servant suffers for his master's crimes. The hunchback turning against his boss is indicative of the story's overall themes of revolt.Potentially interesting themes are undermined by the commitment to melodrama. Differing from the novel, Esmeralda is saved from the gallows. Following the novel, she is actually royalty, the daughter of a rich woman, kidnapped as an infant by gypsies, her birth mother driven mad by the lost. This information is delivered flatly by a very knowledgeable, exposition-prone bit player. Esmarelda's true identity as a princess doesn't affect the plot much. Frollo's villainous machinations and Quasimodo's rebellion are motivated by their passion for the girl. This would probably be fine if the character had more depth. Patsy Ruth Miller looks elegant but the character is pushed around by the whims of the plot. Phoebus, a cynical womanizer in the novel, is transformed into a bland romantic hero, practically obsessed with the girl. The story of class warfare gets lost amidst the romantic entanglements and period grandeur. Hugo's criticism of the Catholic Church is excised totally, Archdeacon Claude Frollo becoming a kind man of the cloth. The role of villain is shifted to his brother, Jehan. Despite this, Brandon Hurst's performance is a highlight, sneering and glaring from under his cap. Even Hurst gets a romantic moment, confessing his love to the girl in her dungeon prison.Even if he isn't the main character, Quasimodo is the most interesting character. Lon Chaney's performance is legendary. Performing under extensive make-up and a fifteen-pound silicon hump, he conveys pathos with only his body language. The moment when Esmarelda comes to the hunchback's aid as he suffers on the pillory is touching strictly because of Chaney, gratitude clearly visible on his face. Chaney vends the hunchback's love with longing looks, selling the romance better then the script can. Quasi's last act before he dies is to ring the bells, celebrating Phoebus and Esmarelda's love, another memorable moment. Chaney overacts at times, sticking his tongue out and grasping his hands. Still, his performance is probably the best thing about the film. Especially since Quasimodo's evolution to anti-hero is a bit rough. Dropping wooden pillars and boiling lead on innocent, rioting gypsies doesn't exactly endear him to the audience.\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\" isn't a horror film but is still visually spectacular. The sets of Notre Dame are beautiful and moody, Gothic arches echoing through the entire church. The Court of Miracles is another fantastic set, teeming with life in cramped, rocky locations. People in ghoulish skeletons costumes dance out from under dark bridges. Deep shadows seal the eerie atmosphere. An extended visit to a torture chamber is another effective, horrific scene. Ultimately, these elements sell me on the movie, not the overwritten, routine story. I probably prefer Disney's version and the Charles Laughton take appears to be the most critically acclaimed but 1923's \"Hunchback\" endures for a reason.", "Universal's successful adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel, \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" features some excellent sets, including a reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral of Paris. In a star-turning role, Lon Chaney is grotesque as the hunchback Quasimodo, although he is more of a supporting character here, which concentrates mostly on the character of Esmeralda and the various love triangles that form around her--one of which includes Quasimodo, who, at first, attacks her and, later, after she pays him a kindness, rescues her twice. There are also many extras. The beginning focuses a lot on showing off the great sets and great-many characters and extras. The first 20-plus minutes are devoted to character introduction and yet more characters are added even after that.The film would've benefited from eliminating some of these characters and subplots. The predictable anti-Roma narrative about a mother whose daughter was stolen by Gypsies, for instance, is pointless here and doesn't go much of anywhere. King Louis XI is introduced early and, then, disappears for the rest of the narrative, although his name and his supposed justice is continually badmouthed throughout. Don Claudio is a cardboard-cutout villain. The romance between Esmeralda and Phoebus is just boring. And the story's ending is turned into a mess. Clopin and his gang of peasantry are supposedly attacking Notre Dame, the sanctuary where Esmeralda is held up to avoid the \"King's justice,\" to rescue her, and Quasimodo gleefully attacks them from atop the Cathedral also in the name of rescuing her. Then, Quasimodo cheers on the soldiers who attack the peasantry, despite the soldiers presumably working for the King and his justice, for which the film leaves open the question of whether Esmeralda will still be hanged for the charge of stabbing Phoebus.", "Silent cinema has its charm and, even today, despite the almost one hundred years since the advent of talking cinema, there are admirers of this era of the seventh art. I'm not one of the most absolute fans, but I do recognize that I enjoy watching these movies from time to time. This is the one I saw most recently. The version I saw is almost two hours old, and I assume is the result of editing work and, eventually, restoration work by Film Preservation Associates, done in 2007 by Davis Shepard and Serge Bromberg (this is information and dates that appear at the end of the film).The story, inspired by the novel by Victor Hugo, takes place in the city of Paris at the end of the Middle Ages, during the reign of Louis XI. The film is very close to the story of the original book: with the Parisian cathedral in the background, the film tells the story of the loves crossed over a beautiful gypsy named Esmeralda, and how she is the object of the lustful desires of Frolo, a cathedral priest willing to do anything to possess it, despite the burgeoning romance between her and an officer in the king's guard, and the passion of Quasimodo, the deaf and deformed cathedral bell-ringer, for whom she is the only person who has shown him affection disinterested.The cast is made up of pretty good actors, but it's Lon Chaney who takes the film on his back, hunchback and all. He's an excellent actor, and he made, with this film, one of the works of his life as an actor. Nigel de Brulier is good in the role of the villain, Frolo, but he never looks like a real priest... more like a twisted version of a Richard III of Shakespeare. Patsy Ruth Miller also seemed a good choice for Esmeralda. Norman Kerry doesn't do much more than try to be the hero on the white horse, Ernest Torrence is underused and the character's ending is rather abrupt.A hundred years ago, when this movie was released, it was a big-budget, ambitious super-production. The amount of extras is colossal, and thinking that almost all of them were prostitutes and bums makes me imagine the abnormal environment of the studio, with cops watching, pickpockets hanging around and prostitutes doing their business behind the scenes. It is difficult to assess the cinematography, as the film is quite damaged, there are segments that were lost or were found in formats that are different from what already existed. However, what exists is good and well done. The film has a good pace, doesn't waste time on unnecessary scenes. The sets are colossal and detailed, and the costumes, although very imaginative, are the best there was at the time and match what was done in 1920. A note, also, for Chaney's makeup, with that false hump, the eyes and everything else sounding very realistic and misshapen. The original soundtrack is lost, but the version I saw contains a good replacement, arranged by Robert Israel, which automatically transports us to the theater and makes us feel like spectators of the film at its premiere.", "This  is  the  first  long  silent  film  I  have  ever  seen,  and  it was much  easier  to  follow  than  I  had  expected.  How  nice  it  is  that we  still  have  the  chance  to  watch  the  old  silent  films!The  acting  was  really  superb.  Quasimodo  and  Esmeralda  looked  again very  similar  to  the  characters  of  the  Dieterle  version,  and  it was  quite  incredible  how  Lon  Chaney  could  so  easily  climb  up  and down  on  the  Cathedral  walls  with  his  huge  hump.  I  was  also content  with  Sister  Gudule  having  her  own  part  in  this film.In  fact  I  was  quite  amazed  that  it  was  Jehan,  not  dom  Claude who  had  lust  for  Esmeralda.  It's  also  strange  that  Captain Phoebus could  change  so  much  that  he  really  cared  for  the  girl.  Once again,  I  pitied  Quasimodo  who  died  after  seeing  the  girl  of  his dreams  embracing  another  man.", "Quasimodo (Lon Chaney) is the hideously deformed bell ringer for Notre Dame. Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller) is a beautiful dancing gypsy. She loves high and mighty Phoebus (Norman Kerry) but is loved by evil, scheming Jehan (Brandon Hurst). All this comes to a head at the end with a revolution.This is not a horror film as many believe. It's a strong, exciting and epic drama. This was a huge production for Universal pictures--the sets themselves covered acres and acres of land. Notre Dame itself is especially impressive. They also got Chaney and Kerry who were both big stars at the time and a supporting cast of hundreds (that's no exaggeration).The movie itself is just great--all the money and effort that went into it pays off. It moves at a brisk pace and the numerous subplots always keep you interested. All the acting is good with top honors going to Hurst, Miller and Kerry. Best of all is Chaney--he's just superb. His acting beneath all that makeup is nothing short of miraculous. In some ways this is almost better than \"Phantom of the Opera\" (which is considered his best movie). I still like \"Phantom\" more but this one is great on its own. A must-see.I saw the uncut 2 hour version on TCM. It's not in the best of shape but is still OK.", "Well for those that only have seen the Disney version I would suggest to watch a non-animated version that stays more truthful to the real story with its tragic ending instead of the happy one in the animation. This might not be the best or most truthful portrayal of the story as I have not read the novel and I have only seen one other version (other than the Disney version) of the movie but can't remember which and don't remember much of it. That said I don't think I need to see another version as I thought this version was fantastic and gripping with wonderful performances from the cast. They call Lon Chaney with good reason the man with a 1000 faces and every movie he plays in seems an instant success. Of course he played the title role. The role of a handicapped or deformed he could play as the best and as always his make-up is splendid as he is unrecognizable. It almost looks like he is a real deformed. It's great how he swings through ropes and crawls like a monkey over the walls of the mighty cathedral. The whole movie is grotesque with the end fight as climax. The story however focuses even more on Esmeralda the gypsy dancer played by the beautiful Patsy Ruth Miller and adopted daughter of Clopin (Ernest Torrence), the king of the beggars. Beautiful and touching are her interactions with Quasimodo and with captain of the royal guard Phoebus de Chateaupers played by Norman Kerry. The story couldn't be any better I think except maybe how they handled the death of Esmeralda's mother, otherwise a movie that is hard to be critical of.", "It is an old silent black and white film from 1923. It has of course been enhanced for this edition that does not guarantee it is what it was. The image is amazingly clear and amazingly well centered and framed. Amazingly for 1923. The story is mythical and has been for nearly two centuries now. This version insists a lot more on the melodramatic than on the tragic. It centers too often on the spectacular and not on the deeply sentimental, sensual and psychological. It turns Quasimodo into a freak and nothing else and we miss the complex network of antagonistic loves running around Esmeralda. What's more it treats the king the way Victor Hugo, a Republican at heart, would never have done because it was perfectly unfair. What's more I would not swear whether the king lived in the Bastille castle or not, but across from the cathedral the famous Ch\u00e2telet was already built, in sections at least, and it was a royal residence. To present the king Louis XI as a tyrant is totally anti-historical, which Victor Hugo was not. In the fifteen century we could say this king was cruel or violent, but he was also just and fair, hence he was only cruel and brutal with those who were considered as guilty in his days, though at times the crimes of these old centuries were absolutely exaggerated. But what the film is very good at expressing is the positive feelings, like love and attraction, plus fear, but not terror or even menace. This American director was also fascinated by crowd movements. It is surprising how far away from his European counterparts he was. The Germans were producing horror films upon horror films, absolutely bleak science-fiction. The Russians were producing masterpieces with Eisenstein but all concentrating on the Soviet revolution and Russian history. Some scene have become mythical too like the pram and the baby going down the stairs in \"Potemkin\". The French were more in sentimental and sentimentalese productions and some realistic left-minded and even openly communist-minded documentaries. On the other side of the Atlantic the great productions where comic films with Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin (who was British by the way) and a few others. This film then is different because it introduces pathos and pathetic situations but with a heavy ideological and anti-historical content.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines", "I remember seeing the 1939 Charles Laughton version of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" as a Million Dollar Movie in the late 1950's, watching it nightly for a week. This was my first viewing of the original Lon Chaney presentation and I was left remarkably impressed with the vision and humanity he gave to the Quasimodo character. Regarded as an inhuman freak by the citizens of fifteenth century Paris, Quasimodo achieves solace from the tolling of the cathedral bells.The movie offers a rather large cast of characters, most of whom have a connection to Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller), stolen as a gypsy baby and raised by Clopin, \"King of Beggars\" (Ernest Torrence) and enemy of kings. The socio-political landscape is a familiar one; King Louis XI (Tully Marshall) reigns over a severely fragmented populace pitting the aristocracy against the street rabble of 1482 Paris. The city comes alive annually for the Festival of Fools, with the ugliest man in Paris crowned as King of the Fools. That honor falls to Quasimodo, but his celebrity turns to disgrace when he kidnaps Esmeralda on behalf of Jehan (Brandon Hurst), brother of the arch deacon of Notre Dame. When Quasimodo is captured and tortured for his indiscretion, only Esmeralda shows pity and offers him some water, recognizing compassion and humanity beneath the grotesque exterior.Esmeralda however is enamored of Phoebus de Chataupers (Norman Kerry), recently elevated to Commander of the Guard by the King. In a particularly intriguing scene, a spider is shown spinning a web, leaving one to wonder who was trapping who. When Jehan attempts to murder Phoebus, the blame falls on Esmeralda. It is only through Quasimodo's vigilance that she is rescued and brought to the safe confines of sanctuary in the cathedral. As the King plots to bring Esmeralda to justice, Clopin incites a Paris mob to come to her aid.Director Wallace Worsley does an admirable job in portraying the mood and feel of fifteenth century Paris, particularly in capturing the squalor of city life. For his part, Lon Chaney endured a most difficult transformation into the bell ringer Quasimodo, outfitting himself with a specially constructed device to inflate his cheeks, a lens that blanked out one of his eyes, and a huge rubber hump weighing almost fifty pounds to affect the manner of the hunchback. All the while he imbues his character with a genuine touch of warmth and humanity that belies the almost horrific appearance, so much so that we feel a loss at the film's finale when the dying hunchback tolls his own death knell.", "Visually, Wallace Worsley's adaptation of 'Notre Dame de Paris' is stunning: the lavish sets are atmospheric; the costumes, while not always historically accurate, are attractive; and the film is lively and well-shot, with (on the whole) an excellent cast. It could have been a superb early Hollywood epic. Unfortunately, the script was maimed by censorship, which set the tone for subsequent US attempts to film Hugo's spectacular novel of 15C Paris. *Some spoilers follow, as I wish to compare the book and the film.*The title itself reflects part of the problem. Despite Victor Hugo's disapproval, since 1832, many popular English-language translations of 'Notre Dame de Paris' have appeared under the 'Hunchback' title, promoting the supporting character of Quasimodo to the leading role. The NAMPI 'Thirteen Points', which prefigured the Hays Code, further fuelled this change of narrative focus. They prohibited the depiction of the clergy in ways that might provoke hostility or loss of respect: a huge obstacle in adapting this novel, which centres upon Claude Frollo, a brilliant young priest who destroys himself and all he loves because he can no longer cope with his vow of celibacy. Other characters were also problematic for the censors: Esm\u00e9ralda's long-lost mother is a penitent former prostitute; the teenaged student Jehan is a drunkard and frequenter of brothels; Ph\u009cbus is a rake who takes Esm\u00e9ralda to a sleazy 'house of assignation' and almost succeeds in seducing her \u2013 indeed, she plasters herself over him more or less begging him to take her! How could the book be sanitised for filming under NAMPI rules?The script retains Claude Frollo's identity as Archdeacon, but makes him remain the sweet, saintly adoptive father of the deformed foundling Quasimodo. It transfers his passion for Esm\u00e9ralda and his alchemy to his secular brother, Jehan \u2013 a spoilt and dissolute undergraduate in the book, but here a middle-aged villain, in league with the king of the underworld, Clopin. Without the psychological conflict over religious vows, the 'thwarted desire' plot loses meaning and intensity. It becomes just another story in which a man ruthlessly pursues a girl who loves someone else. It also wastes the talents of the British actor Nigel de Brulier, whose ascetically handsome features make him one of the best film-Claudes in looks. He could have played Hugo's Claude magnificently, judging by his performance as the prophet Jokanaan, tormented by another provocative teenaged dancer in Alla Nazimova's film of Oscar Wilde's 'Salom\u00e9'. Instead, all he has to do is look pious in a cassock. Film-Jehan (Brandon Hurst) is merely a moustache-twirling melodrama villain, or would be, if he had a moustache!The moustache, however, in one of Hugo's more egregious anachronisms, belongs to Ph\u009cbus de Ch\u00e2teaupers (Norman Kerry), whom the script cleans up to be a conventional romantic lead (a decision copied by Disney in 1996). Yes, he tries to seduce Esm\u00e9ralda (the delightful Patsy Ruth Miller \u2013 young, carefree and charming), but here she resists, and he is won over by her virtue. The film also invents a Cinderella-type scene where she goes to a ball, dressed up as a lady, and captures his heart from his aristocratic fianc\u00e9e Fleur-de-Lys. And of course, despite the various trials and tribulations, they will be rewarded with a happy ending. Pierre Gringoire's role is minimised to that of occasional comic relief: a pity, as he is great fun when he is on screen. P\u00e2quette/Sister Gudule, Esm\u00e9ralda's mother, makes her only Hollywood appearance in this adaptation, in sanitised form, played by Gladys Brockwell. In flashback, we see her as a wealthy lady (presumably a widow) in a grand house, not as the impoverished young prostitute of the novel. Her death is placed earlier than in the novel and in somewhat different circumstances. The script bungles the drama of the belated recognition and reconciliation between mother and daughter: here, P\u00e2quette recognises her child, then dies \u2013 but Esm\u00e9ralda apparently remains none the wiser. Poignant though this is, it seems an odd anti-climax: did this plot-element seem too melodramatic even for 1920s audiences?These days, the reputation of the film rests chiefly on being a star-vehicle for Lon Chaney as Quasimodo \u2013 much overrated, I thought. His make-up was certainly elaborate by the standards of the time \u2013 indeed, too extravagant to be convincing. Quasimodo is a twenty-year-old boy with severe disabilities: he is not a human-ape hybrid, which is what Chaney (wearing an alarming amount of false body-hair during the flogging scene) appears to be playing. In a cinematic reversal of evolution, he is more like an ancestor of King Kong: just swap the Gothic towers of Notre Dame for the Art Deco lines of the Empire State Building. The ending, too, prefigures that of the great ape film: the heroic 'monster' is killed off so that the physically attractive young lovers can be reconciled. It's certainly not Victor Hugo! Indeed, having Quasimodo expire in the arms of his adoptive father, Claude, so far overturns the tragic climax of the novel that it belongs in an entirely alternative universe.Without the distortions of narrative and character imposed by censorship, the talents assembled here could have made a wonderful film. Sadly, the NAMPI restrictions left it picturesque but stunted and deformed \u2013 much like Quasimodo himself.", "Prior to Lon Chaney's masterwork in \"The Phantom of the Opera\", Mr. Chaney used his genius in the field of make-up in this lavish production. The characters were pretty funny at times(especially Norman Kerry, he looked like Cpt. Hook). Patsy Ruth Miller did a good job with the Esmeralda character, and had a lot of beauty and charm. Chaney also delivers an excellent performance as the deformed Quasimodo. He gave the character a lot of passion and emotion, but he also showed great genius in the make-up field. Lon was also game with going through with inconveniences in this role. The best example is when Chaney is getting whipped, he is wearing what some say is a twenty pound hump! Some reports claim that may have been seventy, but lets not get too excited. In any case, not as grand as \"Phantom\" in my opinion, and not only not as scary, Chaney gives a sympathetic performance as Quasimodo in this 1923 \"super-jewel\".", "Yesterday I watched Universal's Silent 1923 version of THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME on PAL VHS (through the Eureka Video label); it was only my second viewing, and it's been almost six years since I purchased it.I was shocked by how terrible this particular print of the film was; I had quite forgotten how bad it looked, but it was close to unwatchable at times: soft and fuzzy overall, and there were so many scratches and specks (throughout a large part of the duration) that the title on the sleeve ought to have read THE SPECKLED HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME!By contrast, I have watched the RKO-produced 1939 version (an altogether superior film) five times. I own a copy on VHS as well, but have not picked up Warners' DVD because it came out in the early days of the format - is there any chance it will be re-issued as a full-blown Special Edtion?I was slightly disappointed by the Chaney film version on first viewing and, while I can say that its stature has grown a bit in my eyes, I can still see its numerous flaws - or, if you like, its shortcomings when compared to the remake. Whereas I can understand the impact it must have made 80 years ago, today it doesn't hang very well together, lacking an overall pace\u0085and the main plot of the film does take an awful lot to get going! The film's overwhelming sets (designed by E.E. Sheeley and Sydney Ullman) are, perhaps, its one outstanding achievement; the inter titles give a satisfactorily detailed breakdown of the plot which can be easily followed (though the framing is off throughout, as these are often lost to over scan - and characters' heads lopped off!), and the dialogue itself is often quite literate (and very rarely falls on archaic medieval colloquialisms).While there's no doubting the quality of Chaney's performance on a technical level, his conception of the role (or maybe the script's) emerges as somewhat unsympathetic: he never quite affects us emotionally the way Charles Laughton does in the 1939 version and, in any case, he is dwarfed by the massive sets - as well as being relatively subservient to the romantic leads, despite the film's title! Apart from all this, I feel that Chaney here is more constrained than abetted by the heavy (indeed, excessive) make-up he has created for himself!Patsy Ruth Miller as Esmeralda is surprisingly animated (in contrast to the usually stiff heroines of Silent films) though Maureen O'Hara in the remake was altogether more believable as a gypsy - and the subplot wherein she is shown to be of noble birth (not present in the 1939 version and, perhaps, thankfully so) is somewhat pointless, as she never discovers this fact for herself anyway! Brandon Hurst as Jehan is a suitably leering villain most of the time but, again, he comes up short when pitted against Cedric Hardwicke's superbly dastardly Frollo in the remake. His supposedly lustful desire for Esmeralda never convinces for a second, feeling as merely a bit of lechery on the side - whereas Hardwicke is almost pitiable in his blinding (and, perhaps, genuine) obsession towards the gypsy girl!Clopin, the self-titled 'King of Beggars', gets a more rounded characterization here than in perhaps any other version (including Thomas Mitchell in the RKO film) and Ernest Torrence gives quite a fine performance in the role. Still, the revolutionary fervor he exudes is a bit much (in particular, his scheming with Jehan to usurp the throne of France!) and, wisely, was transferred onto Gringoire - whose approach was altogether more delicate - in subsequent adaptations of the story. Phoebus has never fared well in the various versions of HUNCHBACK, and Norman Kerry's acting is as one-dimensional as his character; also, it was a mistake to have him survive the stabbing (the only version to do so, as far as I know), presumably in order to allow for a final clinch with the heroine - as Universal, maybe, thought the film would otherwise be too much of a downer!Gringoire is reduced in this version to a buffoonish supporting character, and played by Raymond Hatton in typically exaggerated Silent-film acting; what's more the scene where he is tested by Clopin and his gang in the 'Court of Miracles' - a highlight of the 1939 version - is curiously skimped here! Tully Marshall as King Louis XI - portrayed as an all-out scowling villain - only gets a couple of brief scenes at the beginning, and then disappears altogether from the film! Conversely, Harry Davenport's benevolent royal in the remake may appear a little too quaint for balance but his characterization as such was probably intentional, in order to provide a direct contrast to Frollo - and, perhaps, garner a bit of sympathy for the French courtiers as well!Curiously, the all-important scene where Quasimodo is publicly punished (for attempting to abduct Esmeralda) is hardly given its due, with the film immediately dissolving to its aftermath; by contrast, it doesn't flinch during the torture sequence at Esmeralda's trial! However, the film's climax - with so much action going on at once - is capably handled by director Wallace Worsley (who gives the film an impersonal, and fairly pedestrian, style overall); still, I much prefer the remake's genuinely poignant ending to the rather maudlin one on offer here, with Chaney - fatally wounded - reaching his beloved bell-tower to sound the Cathedral bells one last time.While I may seem to have given the film quite a beating, out of ten feature-films I have watched starring Lon Chaney, I still think it is his second-best film - after THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1925). Actually, I don't think that the latter is itself a perfect film (the no-holds barred melodrama of the plot, and a few weak passages that betray its problematic production - particularly when Chaney is not on screen), but it is on the whole a more satisfying experience than HUNCHBACK - and certainly allows Chaney, in my opinion, a lot more scope and sympathy!The copy of THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME I have is apparently run at Silent-film speed (clocking at a lengthy 137 minutes). Unfortunately, as I've explained earlier, it's practically impossible to evaluate the film's photographic quality due to the precarious state of the print in question; it may be that we're spoil nowadays by watching restored Silent classics on DVD but, then, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA itself has been beautifully treated by Photoplay Productions, Britain's renowned Silent films champion!I know the film was released by Image on DVD back in 1999 (though it only runs for 97 mins.!) and Kino is said to be preparing their own version of both this and PHANTOM. Also, Image is re-issuing a PHANTOM SE (after their initial disc from 1997) as part of 'The Milestone Collection' series, which may be THE version to get in this case. So, hopefully, the upcoming Kino edition of HUNCHBACK can improve on both my Eureka Video PAL VHS and the now-OOP Image DVD.", "The first screen adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't quite as good as the later adaptation with Charles Laughton, but it's still worth seeing, mainly for Lon Chaney Sr.'s performance as the deformed but magnanimous bell ringer in the famous Parisian cathedral. Quasimodo and condemned gypsy girl Esmeralda (Patsy Ruth Miller) do what they can for each other in a world that ostracizes them both.Much of the action outside of the relationship between Quasimodo and Esmeralda didn't really hold my attention that much until what happens at the end of the movie. In fact, outside of the two stars, I could barely tell which character was which most of the time. But once Quasimodo has to defend Esmeralda, everything takes off for sure.All in all, \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" is one that you have to see."], "tt0014188": ["What a weird movie! IMDb's website describes 'The Last Moment' as a horror film, but I would classify it as an adventure film that gradually creeps into melodrama. I found several sequences to be unnerving, but I never once got that shivery frisson that a good horror movie provides.In the first reel of 'The Last Moment', a scientist journeys to Patagonia to capture a creature which is apparently some sort of missing link between humans and apes. Sure enough, he nabs the specimen and puts it into a cage. Throughout the film, this unfortunate creature is identified in the intertitles as -- by turns -- either \"the Beast\" or \"the Thing\". With his beastie in tow, the scientist books passage aboard a freighter bound for the United States, captained by a tough sea-dog known only as the Finn (Louis Wolheim, giving a performance that deserves a better script).The Finn turns out to be totally evil. He chucks the scientist overboard in mid-ocean, planning to keep the Beast for himself and sell it. (Where would he sell it? Beasts-R-Us? Monsters-U-Like?) Whilst his ship is in port, the Finn encounters debutante Alice Winthrop (Doris Kenyon) and a nervous bookworm who rejoices in the name Hercules Napoleon Cameron (Henry Hull, streets away from 'Werewolf of London'). Straight off, the Finn shanghais them. I found this utterly ridiculous; Alice and Hercules (despite his name) are a couple of weaklings who are obviously useless as deckhands, and Alice (as played by Doris Kenyon) is only mildly pretty, hardly likely to ignite a sea-dog's lust when surely there are sexier women available.Anyway, they're all at sea (so is the script) and the Thing is still snug in its cage. The Finn threatens Alice when she fails to fall for his charms. Hercules valiantly rushes to her aid, and the Finn promptly beats the tar out of Hercules. (This is the most believable scene in the whole movie.) SPOILERS COMING. Eventually there's a storm at sea. The Thing finally breaks out of its cage. Hercules confronts the creature in the gunwales, and actually stares the Beast down! As the storm rages, Hercules and the creature go overboard together, and fight in the water. Credibility goes down for the third time, and never comes up for air.The most interesting character in this movie is that half-human creature in the cage. Unfortunately, we never do get a good look at it. In the early sequences, when the creature is kept in shadow or the camera's sightlines only just bypass it, I assumed that the director was holding back for a climactic sequence in which we finally get a good look at this humanoid. Some hope! I did manage to get just enough of a squizz at the Thing to realise that the actor in the cage is a negro. I'm not sure if this casting is racist or not; it seems to indicate that a black man is the best choice to play a creature who's less fully evolved than a human being.I'll rate 'The Last Moment' 6 out of 10 just for being such an unusual film, but the climax is a letdown and most of what comes before it is implausible."], "tt0014509": ["This charming film is practically unknown, but it is one of Klein-Rogge's best performances, as he plays a romantic lead with a dash of villainy. Klein-Rogge is the feared Master who lives in a bleak castle on top of a mountain, and the villagers in the valley below dread his ill-omened arrival at every wedding.  The story concerns one couple who marries despite the master's baleful influence, only to have him crash their wedding party and bring about the death of the bride.  The bride's sister, seeking revenge, tries to kill the Master but instead they fall in love, as she realizes that he is not really evil, but blighted by a loveless existence.  Their love is ill-starred, however, as the Master kills an insolent guest at their wedding who takes liberties with his bride, and this is followed by a peasants' revolt, where the castle is stormed and the Master captured.  In the end, the lovers escape, but their love is finally doomed.  The year before this film, Klein-Rogge had his great triumph as the evil Dr. Mabuse in Fritz Lang's 'Dr. Mabuse, Der Spieler', and his most memorable roles have been as villains.  This movie demonstrates what a really wide range he had as an actor - he starts off with his very characteristic glowering villain, but once the girl enters his life he demonstrates both joy and tenderness, as well as grief and pain when he thinks he has lost everything.  I don't know if such an obscure film could be a candidate for restoration, but it would be a worthy project, as the sets, costumes and many of the performances are as classic examples of expressionism as one could hope to see.", "In a distant Teutonic village, people dance and drink merrily celebrating a wedding feast. However, an elderly man tells the villagers that the valley where they live wasn't always happy but sorrowful. This was due to the tyranny of the master of the mountains ( Herr Rudolf Klein-Rogge as wild as his hairdo ) who ruled the valley despotically.He lived in a Schloss up the mountains, whipped his servants for any reason (Sound familiar?) and when a wedding was going to be celebrated, he descended into the valley asking for his \"droit de seigneur\".During one such encounter, a young bride is accidentally killed by the groom who was trying to protect her from the claws of the master of the mountains. The girl's sister vows revenge and journeys to the Schloss with the intention of killing the tyrant.It is very strange that this remarkable film, \"Der Steinerne Reiter\", directed by Herr Fritz Wendhausen, has not received the attention its many merits deserve, especially considering its Expressionist touches.Outstanding are the settings included in this film, particularly the gloomy Schloss carved out of the mountains contrasting with the idyllic village that lies below. The sense of constant menace is pervasive, exemplified by the superb shot when the master of the mountains approaches the village and his shadow as a rider darkens the town. And of course there are quaint customs to observe( presumed typical but at the same time extravagant, perfect for Expressionism mode ), and there's a fantastic and supernatural ending which fits the pitch dark mood perfectly, all put together in a script by the well known Dame Thea von HarbouAnother interesting aspect of the story is a twist in the middle of the oeuvre; the master is redeemed by love but his serfs turn cruel when they take justice into their own hands blurring the thin line between good and evil.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must complain to his imitator, the master of the mountains, about copyright infringement.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/", "This film surprised me when I first saw it, as I was not at all expecting such moving scenes from this fairly unknown masterpiece. Thea von Harbou wrote the screenplay, and obviously she wrote the main part for her ex-husband, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, as no one else could have played this role with such suffering nobility as he did.The Rider lives on a mountaintop overlooking the village that he rules over with cruelty. The very thought of him making a visit to the village stirs the most absolute dread and hatred. But if the people could see beyond his wild, brutish exterior, they would see that he is actually very lonely and miserable with the place he was given in life. His mother died when he was born, and his father hated him all of his life. Because of his wretched existence, the Rider lives spitefully, purposely stirring up trouble just to make a sensation of himself.But when his antics get an innocent young bride killed, he seriously begins to contemplate how evil he is becoming. The bride's vengeful sister soon comes for the Rider at his mountain fortress, intent on driving a blade through his wicked heart. However, when she finds him broken and tearful in repentance for the unintentional murder he had brought about, she cannot find the strength to kill him. Through time, they come to grow attached to each other, as she sees that he is in fact a courteous lord who treats his servants well. Although timid and afraid of his advances at first, she soon falls deeply in love with him...The rest of the story I won't give away. You just have to see it. This film is very much an Expressionistic piece, but it has a healthy dose of German Romanticism that fits it just perfectly. Worth the effort of finding if just to see the kinder, gentler side of Klein-Rogge's acting."], "tt0014586": ["This interesting and generally creative silent horror movie is really not all that tense or suspenseful, but it has some interesting stories and characters, and the distinctive expressionistic settings add considerably to the atmosphere. The three stories told about the \"Waxworks\" all have their own strengths.It's rather interesting to see Emil Jannings as the Caliph in the first sequence. It's hard not to associate Jannings with the serious characters he played in \"The Blue Angel\" and \"The Last Laugh\", yet here he quite successfully portrays the Caliph as something of a buffoon. This story is the lightest of the three, yet it works well due to some creative touches.The Ivan the Terrible sequence features an interesting, if rather far-fetched, story and a pretty good performance by Conrad Veidt as Ivan. The last sequence, with Spring-Heeled Jack, comes the closest to producing real fear, and it's just unfortunate that it was not more fully developed.The biggest strength of \"Waxworks\" is its settings, which establish the right atmosphere and lend an aura of the bizarre that helps the stories to be more convincing. Overall, while not in the class of the finest silent horror classics, this works quite well as lighter entertainment.", "It's only when you begin to delve deeper into works of German Expressionism that you can appreciate how important and influential a film was 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920).' It demonstrated to filmmakers and audiences that cinema is an inherently artificial medium, and so, rather than striving for realism, films should emphasise the fake and fantastic elements of their story. Though Frenchman Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s had first struck on this idea at the turn of the twentieth century, it was Robert Wiene's creative horror film that established German Expressionism as the defining artistic style of the 1920s, securing post-War Germany as cinema's most prominent innovator and paving the way for directors F.W. Murnau, Fritz Lang and Paul Leni {each of whom were later coaxed to Hollywood to share their expertise}. The hand of 'Caligari' is evident throughout 'Das Wachsfigurenkabinett / Waxworks (1924),' a fantasy/horror that is framed around a young writer's attempt to concoct thrilling tales to accompany three carnival waxwork characters - Harun al Raschid, Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper.Three names come to mind more readily than most when one considers silent German actors: Conrad Veidt {'The Man Who Laughs (1928)'}, Werner Krauss {'Herr Tart\u00fcff (1925)'} and, of course, Emil Jannings {'Faust (1926)'}. It's no surprise that both Veidt and Krauss had achieved their stardom with 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' four years earlier, and the parallels between that film and 'Waxworks' stretch much further than the mere casting decisions. The film, co-directed by Paul Leni and Leo Birinsky, employs grossly-exaggerated art direction {the sets designed by Leni himself} and Helmar Lerski's imaginatively-warped cinematography to highlight the fantasy in each story, even though there are very few elements that would ordinarily be considered fantastic. Emil Jannings plays the rotund Harun al Raschid, the fifth Abbasid Caliph, with a loathsome repugnance that gradually gives way to a certain likability. When his intentions towards the beautiful Maimune (Olga Belajeff) are shown to be friendly rather than sexual, he becomes an affable and cartoonish oaf.This segment is followed by the story of Ivan the Terrible (Conrad Veidt), who is driven to madness by the trickle of sand through an hour-glass, every falling grain bringing him closer to demise. Veidt plays the cruel Grand Prince of Moscow with a wide-eyed craziness that calls to mind the intense acting style of fellow-German Klaus Kinski. One of the earliest portrayals of Ivan the Terrible, this segment no doubt influenced Sergei Eisenstein when he directed 'Ivan the Terrible: Part I and II (1944).' The final story, definitely the scariest of the three, concerns Jack the Ripper \u0096 also referred to as the mythical Spring-Heeled Jack for some reason, perhaps due to a translation error. Though it barely runs for five minutes, I found my heart genuinely thumping as Jack (Werner Krauss) stalked through the dream-like haze of Luna Park, as the young writer (William Dieterle) and his girl (Olga Belajeff) flee from his multiple eerie shadows, every step leading them ever-so-closer to the cold glint of his knife.The framing device around which 'Waxworks' revolves unavoidably leads to a distracting unevenness of tone, the atmosphere fluctuating between light-hearted comedy and gruelling horror. Also rather frustrating is the fact that Jannings' segment, while certainly entertaining at a satisfactory level, is afforded so much screen-time, and yet Krauss' Jack the Ripper killing-spree is wrapped up in a matter of minutes. Since a fourth character tale, about Rinaldo Rinaldini, was scrapped due to budget constraints, I suspect that funding also played a role in reducing the third act. However much of an oddity it might be, 'Waxworks' is nevertheless a visual marvel, and no shortage of imagination has been expended on the strange and exciting set and costume designs. The film certainly impressed studios in Hollywood, for director Paul Leni was subsequently lured to the United States to continue his career, after which he notably directed 'The Cat and the Canary (1927)' and 'The Man Who Laughs (1928),' before his premature death in 1929.", "In the wake of World War I, German film was sharply influenced by expressionism, an arts movement which is less concerned with imitating reality than in using design to reflect psychology and emotion. THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI brought the style to the screen in 1919, and throughout the 1920s many directors would create projects under its influence.German director Paul Leni (1885-1929) was one such--and although he is best recalled for his later Hollywood films, most notably the stylish THE CAT AND THE CANARY, the 1924 German WAXWORKS shows him very near the peak of gifts. It is also very clearly an homage of sorts to THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI; not only would Leni cast two of that film's actors in major roles, he drew from the film's style for both sets and cinematography.WAXWORKS is an \"anthology\" film, a collection of stories bound together by a running thread. A young writer (William Dieterle) is employed by a carnival sideshow wax museum to write stories about several of their figures: a Baghdad Caliph, Ivan the Terrible, and Spring Heeled Jack. As he writes, the film segues into the story the writer invents.The longest of the three stories concerns Harun al Raschid, a Caliph of Baghdad who falls in love with a baker's wife--and then seeks to take her for his own. Featuring the celebrated Emil Jannings as the Caliph, the episode is a mixture of light comedy and Arabian Nights fantasy, particularly noted for the greatly stylized sets that recall the earlier CALIGARI and THE GOLEM to somewhat softer effect. It also offers the very rare opportunity to see Jannings, famed for his dramatic roles, in comic mode, and he proves equally adept with this bit of fluff as with his more \"serious\" work.The second episode is a fantasy suggested by Russian ruler Ivan the Terrible, who delights in poisoning prisoners but finds himself fearful of his highly gifted poison-mixer. Ivan is played by Conrad Veidt, who appeared as the murderous Cesare in CALIGARI; one of Germany's most popular actors of the silent screen, Veidt was also noted for his gift at playing insanity, and his Ivan is the very incarnation of madness. As in the earlier episode, the sets are also fantastic, although perhaps not so obviously so.Fine though the first two sequences are, it is really the last that is most famous, and justly so. Here Leni sets the story against the carnival itself and presents it in grotesque, dreamlike images that very deliberately recall CALIGARI; moreover, he casts actor William Dieterle, who played Caligari himself, as a menacing killer who slowly stalks his terrified victims. The killer is referred to as both Spring Heeled Jack and Jack the Ripper; clearly, however, he is more akin to the latter. The cinematography in this sequence is particularly fine, using multiple exposures in a way that foreshadows Leni's stylish THE CAT AND THE CANARY.In an overall sense, WAXWORKS is quite fine, and were it not for the fact the final sequence is so short I would easily give it a full five stars. The Kino DVD also offers a very good transfer, complete with original tinting; unfortunately, however, it offers no bonus material except a Leni short--an unexpected but mildly interesting \"filmed crossword puzzle.\" Although some may find the anthology nature of the film a bit off-putting, silent fans will likely love WAXWORKS from start to finish.GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "\"Waxworks\" is an early example in film history of a movie that's clearly in homage to another film--in this case, \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920). The expressionistic stylization in the film is obviously influenced by \"Caligari\", and a few references to that film reinforces that, beginning with the title. The literal translation of \"Das Wachsfigurenkabinett\" is \"The Wax Figures Cabinet\"--the keyword being \"cabinet\". Additionally, the frame narrative is purposefully set at a carnival, although a more dimensional one than the stage setting in \"Caligari\".The narrative structure is closer to Fritz Lang's \"Destiny\" (1921), with the framing of three odd stories. \"Waxworks\" has the clever device of a writer of the inner stories in the framing story. And, the three biggest stars of Weimar cinema (Emil Jannings, Conrad Veidt and Werner Krauss) play the historical villains and waxworks come alive in the inner stories. For the three stories, a different expressionistic technique dominates, each relating to and enhancing their respective themes. In the Harus al Raschid narrative featuring Jannings, it's the sets (Paul Leni's sphere) with oddly shaped architecture more akin to \"Caligari' than Baghdad. Especially nice is the staircase set. Rather than the horrific, dreamlike abstraction of \"Caligari\", however, the sets are delightfully peculiar, as is Jannings and the silly story. Low-key lighting dominates the Ivan the Terrible episode featuring a darkly paranoid Veidt, and the multiple exposure kaleidoscope imagery places Krauss's stalking serial killer everywhere.A clever film, and Leni and the other filmmakers seem to have had fun with it, which crosses over to viewers, but beyond that it's rather lackluster, not emotionally engaging as \"Destiny\", nor stunningly fresh as \"Caligari\".", "This is a movie that features 3 kind of different stories, when the owner of a wax museum hires a writer to write 3 stories for 3 of his models; Harun al Raschid, Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper. It provides the movie with 3 different stories, set at different times and each with a new different main character, played by the finest 3 German actors of their time period. It's a very creative and interesting concept, also of course really when considering that this movie got made in 1924.In order to keep all of the stories still somewhat connected and make the movie more coherent as a whole, all of the stories feature the two actors William Dieterle and Olga Belajeff, each time in different roles. But when you have 2 stories of about halve an hour and then another one of just 5 minutes, can you still really call this movie a coherent one? It can be presumed that budgeting reasons was the reason why the last story of the movie is so much shorter. It was originally even planned to shoot a fourth story about Rinaldo Rinaldini. The character can still be seen at the start of movie, standing between the other waxed characters. Even though all stories are different and set in completely different time periods, they still have the same overall style over it, which still is a reason why this movie still feels like a whole one.All the episodes are good looking but the stories for it aren't always that interesting. Basically since it at times it kind of dragging and despite some early action and adventure elements, the movie still is sort of a lackluster. Well lack-lusting perhaps isn't the right way to describe it. It's more that it's not really engaging enough at all times.But of course the looks and style of the movie compensate a lot. This is a real expressionistic German movie, with some fantastic distinctive expressionistic sets. That alone already makes this movie for the lovers of German expressionistic style an absolute must-see.It's absolutely a great fact that this movie features Emil Jannings, Conrad Veidt and Werner Krauss, who were really the biggest, best known and best German actors of their time. The movie also features William Dieterle, who later gained more fame as a director of movies such as \"The Life of Emile Zola\" and the 1939 version of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", with Charles Laughton.It's basically a fun entertaining movie from the early '20's, that is truly worth watching for plenty of reasons.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "As it happens, this is yet another faux horror film from director Paul Leni - but, then, it's mentioned in every book on the genre I have, so this common misconception has probably more to do with the authors than with the films themselves having been sold back in the day as such! Anyway, this factor had certainly marked my initial viewing of the film - which, again, I had found rather disappointing; a second look reaps rewards in that it can be taken for what it is - and not for what it's been played up to be over the years! That said, the film started cinema's macabre interest in wax museums which, by and large, endures to this day...The premise itself is undeniably interesting: a young writer is asked to concoct blood-curdling tales about famous historical figures (we're not told what they are for, but I'd assume that the fairground owner would relate these tales on a stage to draw the crowds in). Initially it was intended to be a four-part film with the characters being Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, Czar Ivan \"The Terrible\", Jack The Ripper (dubbed \"Spring-Heeled Jack\"!; is that how the notorious serial killer was known in the U.S.?) and highwayman Rinaldo Rinaldini; eventually, the whole section relating to the latter was dropped (but I'm curious to know who had been cast in this role - his wax figure is still visible in the linking narrative, but I couldn't discern the 'actor' whom it was supposed to look like!).The Haroun-al-Raschid episode is the first, longest and least 'horrific': in fact, it's outright comedy for the most part, with Emil Jannings' obese and perennially grimacing Caliph flirting with the beautiful wife (Olga Belaieff) of poor but jealous baker Wilhelm Dieterle; the latter, meanwhile, is scolded by the girl for their poverty and colorless lifestyle - so he contrives to break into the Caliph's palace and steal his \"wishing ring\". What he doesn't know is that the figure in the Caliph's bed is made of wax: he cuts the hand and takes it to his wife (who is concealing the real Caliph inside her husband's oven!), pursued by the palace guards; the wife, then, pulls a magic trick by 'summoning' the Caliph intact - but asks the latter to reward her husband by making him his personal baker! The sets (designed by Leni himself) for this episode are spectacular, and they're made even more arresting by being filtered through the director's Expressionist sensibilities - so that everything appears distorted and generally exaggerated. This entire Arabian Nights set-up apparently inspired Douglas Fairbanks to make THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924), and Kino provides a brief clip from that film for the sake of comparison.The second episode - dealing with Czarist Russia at the time of Ivan \"The Terrible\" (embodied as a neurotic by Conrad Veidt, in a performance that anticipates the intense acting style that Klaus Kinski would come to be known for!) - is the best, despite its extremely slow pace. Interestingly, the stylized look of this section of the film also foreshadows Sergei Eisenstein's awesome two-part version made some 20 years later (which even adopts the ruse of having Ivan change places with a subordinate in order to dodge an assassination attempt). The romantic leads of the first story (who are actually those of the linking narrative - Dieterle being the young writer and Belaieff the daughter of fairground owner John Gottowt) return here as a couple whose wedding is disrupted by Veidt, who takes a liking to the girl and has her abducted to his lair. The plot is resolved when Ivan's poison-mixer (this is how the Czar dispatches his enemies) is imprisoned by his own increasingly paranoid ruler, but the former takes his revenge by inscribing Ivan's name on a sandglass - the marker that a new victim has been poisoned and has an hour to live - after which the Czar, driven insane, keeps turning the hour-glass upside down in a desperate attempt to buy himself a little more time...! Again, apart from Veidt himself, the sets are the main thing here; the generally grim tone of this episode makes it borderline horror, which is only really achieved by the third - and, regrettably, shortest - segment.The Jack The Ripper story (if so it can be called) actually ties in with the linking narrative, as the writer is stalked in the fairground tent itself by the knife-wielding maniac (incarnated by the resident villain of the German Expressionist movement, Werner Krauss); I say incarnated because the character isn't developed in any way, given that the episode lasts for barely 5 minutes (surely the horror fan's biggest bone of contention with this entertaining super-production) - still, the vision of his menacing shadowy figure superimposed, magnified and replicated all over the place is extremely effective and one of the undeniable highlights of the entire film.The restored print of WAXWORKS presented here includes several tinted sequences which, though nicely done, draw too much attention to themselves and, worse, tend to obscure some of the details in the image!", "I don't want to be harsh or negative on movies from the silent era because, after all, they were the true pioneers, but some of them are really an ordeal to struggle through. \"Waxworks\", for instance, is much more fascinating from a 'historical value' point of view than from an 'entertainment' angle. The concept of the film is brilliant, and the names of the people involved are downright amazing! It seems as if everyone who was even remotely important during the German expressionism era was partaking in this film. Director Paul Leni! Cast members Werner Krauss, Emil Jannings, William Dieterle, Conrad Veidt! What a cast! And the plot is so unique I even daresay \"Waxworks\" was the one and only forefather of the horror omnibus/anthology concept. The genius \"Dead of Night\" (1945) might have been a much better film, but \"Waxworks\" must have been the first. The wraparound story is great, too. The resident wax-sculptor of a traveling carnival places an ad in the paper, looking for a writer to fantasize imaginative stories for his creations. The charming young man who presents himself doesn't only invent stories about the statues, but also processes himself and the sculptor's beautiful daughter in them.So far, so good. I truly wished I could say that the three individual segments were little masterpieces, but alas. They actually are rather dull, incomprehensible and - in case of the first two - unnecessarily overlong. The first tale stars the Emil Jannings as the Caliph of Bagdad, and he's trying to woo the lovely wife of a simple baker. The baker, crazy jealous, wants to prove his manhood by breaking into to the palace and steal the Caliph's wishing ring. The premise is interesting enough, but the story lasts far too long. The second tale stars my favorite actor from the silent era, Conrad Veidt, as the Russian Czar Ivan the Terrible. As much as I admire Veidt's charismatic looks and his facial expressions of pure madness, I honestly can't guess what the point of the tale was. It seems like the Czar is just abusing his power at a wedding party, terrorizing all the other guest, but eventually he believes he was poisoned and spends the rest of his days tipping over a (zandloper). Then, you notice there's less than five minutes of running time left, but there supposedly still comes a segment with Werner Krauss as Jack the Ripper. This is, however, merely an insignificant epilogue and I was quite disappointed by that.\"Waxworks\" features beautiful color schemes and imaginative decors, typical of German expressionism, but the pacing is too slow, and the stories are sadly unmemorable. Personally, I wouldn't recommend this film to people who aren't yet acquainted with silent cinema, especially since there are numerous of other genuine masterpieces to discover (\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", \"Faust\", \"Der Golem\", ...)", "A poet is hired by the owner of a wax museum in a circus to write tales about Harun al Raschid, Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper. While writing, the poet and the daughter of the owner, Eva, fantasize the fantastic stories and fall in love for each other.\"Das Wachsfigurenkabinett\" is an impressive and very creative movie, changing the colors in accordance with the environment and with amazing scenarios and funny stories. The acrobatic performance of the character Assad the Baker, jumping from a tower of the palace in Baghdad to a tree, is incredible. I did not understand why the genres horror and even thriller are listed for these three romantic adventures in the world of fantasy. I liked very much the first story, indeed very funny and naive; the second one is darker; and the very short third one is weird and romantic. The locations and the atmosphere are another attraction of this great unknown silent movie. I saw an excellent restored version with 83 minutes running time. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Gabinete das Figuras de Cera\" (\"The Chamber of the Wax Figures\")", "Usually in these Wax horrors, it's the notion of a life entombed in the body that is meant to unsettle, a life extended even into death (or is it the opposite?). This is the first of these films as far as I know - later came the two Houses of Wax, another Waxwork in '88, the Italian Wax Mask from an Argento story - and so the notion is more outdated, more novelistic. Each life a separate story and world, with clear boundaries between them, and acted out by the same couple that writes the stories back in the level of reality.In Baghdad we get a romantic adventure where the Caliph falls for the baker's girl. Eventually she restores balance by summoning the dead Caliph from beyond the grave for the eyes of his awe-struck vassals. It's a ploy by which the status quo of the Arabian nights is maintained.In Czarist Russia, the cruel czar who thought he would defy even death is faced with his own mortality. Instead of accepting this common fate, thus coming to understand that a king is also a common man and in so doing be rendered free of his own despotic bonds, he goes mad. It's again a ploy, the poison-maker's vengeance from beyond the grave. But he was mad to begin with, so it doesn't quite matter.The final story that blends back into the wrap-around and brings us full circle, is about a notorious killer who stalks a man and his girl. This is the segment that strikes some spark; the urbane setting diffused as dreamy, expressionist poem. It's again a ploy, this time a dream - or nightmare.Both Emil Jannings and Conrad Veidt, stars of what was then a booming film industry, relish the opportunity of playing scheming tyrants. But it's all harmless stuff.", "I really enjoyed that film. It's not a masterpiece, like \"Caligari\" or \"Nosferatu\", but a good fun film anyway. Veidt and Jannings are wonderful. The first part, about Haroun al Rashid (played by Emil Jannings), is very humorous (and funny as well), with well written plot. The second part, about Ivan the Terrible (played by Conrad Veidt), is, in contrast, very dark and depressing. In my humble opinion, it is much better than Eisenstein's movie (which also steals shamelessly from it); for sure, Veidt is better than Cherkasov. The third story is something really weird: it starts and suddenly ends, like the crew ran out of money.So, a lot of humour in the first part, a lot of \"Russian gothic\" ;-) in the second part, good acting, good plot, great sets -- if you like silent movies (especially expressionist silent movies), don't miss this one!P.S. If you like silent movies and still haven't seen \"Cabinet of Doctor Kaligari\" and \"Nosferatu, symphony of horror\", see them first -- they are better than \"Waxworks\"!", "A poet is hired by the owner of a wax museum in a circus to write tales about Harun al Raschid, Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper. While writing, the poet and the daughter of the owner, Eva, fantasize the fantastic stories and fall in love with each other.Director Paul Leni tells three stories, with the great German actors Emil Jannings (\"Last Laugh\"), Werner Krauss (\"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\") and Conrad Veidt (\"Caligari\") playing their roles. With this cast and director, you should expect greatness. Personally, I did not find it as great as it could have been, but this may be because I was expecting a horror film and because the film's quality was not what it could be.Kino deserves a lot of credit for releasing this film, especially considering that they had to mix two different sources. The unfortunate part is how pixelated the film is. Even on a medium-sized TV, the squares are evident. Maybe this is unavoidable, but it does make the transfer look cheap. (To be fair, the version I saw in the theater looked no better.)I am tempted to complain about historical accuracy, but I will not. I hope people know that Ivan the Terrible did not get obsessed with an hour glass and that Jack the Ripper never killed men. But, heck, who knows? I will say this: if you watch the film in a theater (which is quite a treat), the only way to do this is with live organ accompaniment. Please watch it like that, otherwise just rent or buy it. The Kino version comes with a nice Paul Leni short.And keep in mind how influential this film was. All wax museum films can be traced back to it, and it is widely believed that \"Thief of Baghdad\" took its inspiration from this film.", "In the 1920s, the German film industry was one of the best producers of films in the world--making many films that were about as good as anything coming out of Hollywood. Because of this, I had relatively high expectations for this film. Sadly, however, despite this and a wonderful idea for a movie, \"Waxworks\" turned out to be, at best, a mediocre film--mostly because it was written so poorly and the stories all were so unsatisfying.The idea behind \"Waxworks\" is that the owner of some wax figures wants a writer to come up with some great stories about each of his three figures in order to lure in the public. This anthology notion is pretty good...but the execution left so much to be desired.The first story is about a Caliph in ancient times and this story is by far the longest of the three. It seems that this Caliph has fallen for the baker's wife and he sneaks in to make love to her. At the same time, the baker is sneaking in to the nearby palace to steal the Caliph's magic ring. Unable to get it off the hand easily, he chops off the Caliph's arm! Oddly, the Caliph just lays there--but at the same time he IS at the baker's house--what gives? This Middle Eastern set is interesting because some of the artistic style looks almost like a book by Dr. Seuss. Unfortunately, the story itself isn't particularly interesting even if it starred the world-famous Emil Jannings. Sadly, it's the best of the three.The second story is about Ivan the Terrible. Oddly, the sets are VERY tiny--almost claustrophobic. And the story about Ivan, poison and madness just isn't interesting in the least.The final about Spring Heeled Jack wasn't great but at least it was visually arresting. That's because, like \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", it's a wonderful example of German Expressionism--with its crazy art style. It's all supposed to be a dream, so it makes sense that that they used this weird look.Overall, the film looks pretty cool but the stories just bored me to death. I sure expected better writing.", "Clocking in at 83 minutes, this silent film directed by Paul Leni & Leo Birinsky might be quite possibly the first feature-length anthology type movie. It's not considered much as a horror movie like later other wax figures films were made out to be. The story is certainly not like 1933's 'Mystery of the Wax Museum', 1953 'House of Wax' nor the 1988 film with the same name where people disappear and end up as wax-coated corpses. Instead the film written by Henrik Galeen tells the story a young nameless poet (William Dieterle) hired to write a series of stories about the waxworks exhibits of the Caliph of Baghdad Harun al-Rashid (Emil Jannings), Ivan the Terrible (Conrad Veidt) and Jack the Ripper (Werner Krauss) in order to boost business at a carnival sideshow wax museum. As he writes, the film segues into the stories the young man has dreamt up with. The first being a comedic fantasy about a young baker Assad also played by William Dieterle having to steal the Caliph's ring, in order to get out of poverty. This 40 mins tale is told mediocre at best. Not only was the story pacing dragging in some areas. It was also uneven with its tone. The color tinting doesn't match the visuals that much. While I do know green means adventurous, it also makes the set look like it's shot in the jungle. I got Flintstone vibes because of that. I felt that yellow or orange would better fit the desert location rather than the opening inside of the wax museum carnival moments. That should had been black and white. Also, I don't know if I should be laughing at people wanting to murder each other by cutting limps while attempted adultery is going on. I felt more to giggle at the outlandish silly costumes that everybody was wearing; especially Jannings. The ending was a huge cop out with semi unfaithful nagging wife Maimune (Olga Belajeff) getting her wish. I kinda wanted a climax where they found other means to get out of poverty than having to steal and murder and the Caliph being oddly being alright with both. I felt that the story could had use the baking premise more to gain the leader trust through his stomach. It could make more sense that this ending. After all, he still could kill the theft and take his wife. Despite that, Janning seems to be having the time of his life with this role. However, it doesn't save the sequence from becoming a silly pantomime even if the German expressionist rounded bee hive clay houses sets are quite beautiful. Regardless a lot of people have said that this segment of the picture was the inspiration for the Douglas Fairbanks' film, 1924 'Thief of Bagdad'. However, that is impossible since Fairbanks movie premiered in February while 'Waxworks' did not receive its German release until November of the same year. It wasn't even released in America until 1926. It's more likely that Leni's film was influenced by 1921 Rudolph Valentino 'The Sheik'. Better yet, from Robert Wiene's 1920 film 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'. You see mostly in the second part. If the backgrounds for the first sequence rounded felt open and dreamlike. The Russian set is shape and cram. Near nightmarish. The wildly nonrealistic, geometrically absurd angles, along with designs painted on walls and floors to represent lights, shadows and objects match the mood of madness, insanity & betrayal as Ivan try to control his fate forever turning the hour glass after surviving an assassination attempt at a wedding. Conrad Veidt gives a harrowing, anemic performance here. This by far is the best moments of the film both in acting and visuals even if it went a little too long with 37 minutes. No wonder why Russian director Sergei Eisenstein would later use Veidt's model for his own historical drama rendition of the Czar in 1946. As for the Jack the Ripper sequence, the mind-bending array of distorted lens, shadow lighting effects and double exposures were all cool to see here. Yet I was disappointing that the sequence of him coming to live to haunted the poet didn't get that much screen time. 5 minutes in fact. The film's script by Henrik Galeen was even more shortened by Leni as it also drops the fourth tale in the anthology about a fictional robber Rinaldo Rinaldini who was to be played also by William Dieterle. I get why, it wouldn't match the semi historical fantasy figures tone of the movie. However, why did Leni leave that character in the beginning of the film and then turn the last character into Spring Heeled Jack if they weren't going for that. After all, Krauss's appearance doesn't even match the descriptions of the devilish folklore entity despite looking scary. I think there was a loss of cultures translations here between the German and English filmmakers. The anthology film is not so coherent. Overall: Once described as a lost movie, 'Waxworks' is now available on the internet for free. Some of them are rather beat up with grain, but still quite accepted. Nevertheless, if you really want a satisfactory print of the movie. Try the Kino version. It has the corrected original color tinted and speed. As for soundtracks. That DVD has an absolutely delightful piano score from Jon C. Mirsalis that captures the mood of the film exceedingly well. While vocalist Mike Patton of Faith No More fame had a very trippy weird live score for the silent film in other copies. I will stick to Mirsalis. In the end, this dark and intriguing stylistic exercise is still one of the most interesting films to come out of Germany's silent film industry. It also marks Leni's last film made in Europe before he fled from the Nazis to the United States before dying of blood poisoning in 1929. It's watchable, but not quite essential viewing.", "Paul Leni's expressionist horror movie looks great, but it never really takes off in the way you expect. Future Hollywood director William Dieterle not only plays a writer hired to provide backstories for the sinister figures in a fairground was museum, but he also stars as the hero of those stories opposite the comely Olga Belajeff. But Emil Jannings and Conrad Veidt are the big guns here - respectively playing a randy Caliph and psychotic Ivan the Terrible - and both seem to be having a whale of a time.", "\"Das Wachsfigurenkabinett\" (1924) is Herr Paul Leni's most well-known film during his German period. Its probably the most representative of his artistic virtues, an oeuvre composed of three episodes ( although Herr Leni planned a fourth episode that never was done ) in where an imaginative writer ( Herr Wilhelm Dieterle ) applied for publicity work in a waxworks exhibition in which he is commanded to write startling tales about three different wax figures: Ivan the Terrible, Czar of all the Russias ( Herr Conrad Veidt ), Haroun Al Raschid, Caliph of Bagdad ( Herr Emil Jannings ) und the murderer Spring Heeled Jack ( Herr Werner Krauss ). The young writer and the showman's daughter ( Frau Olga Belejeff ) link the three different episodes.The three episodes are stylistically and technically very different from each other and certainly Herr Leni explored his most imaginative resources and fond subjects ( oneiric d\u00e9cors connected with fantastic subjects ) using them appropriately to fit the characteristics of the story depicted in the episode in question.The first one, which relates the story of the satyr and easy-going Caliph of Bagdad, features the beautiful and evocative d\u00e9cors that apprehend the necessary mood for an episode in which humour and parody over the iconic Western view of an idealized Arab atmosphere. The classic adventures that inspired them, is in the air, benefiting the episode with such exaggerated tastes which are absolutely charming; Herr Jannings certainly enjoys a lot such parody role.The second episode depicts Ivan the terrible as a merciless monarch who ruled the Russian empire with an iron fist by subjecting the citizens to severe cruelty. This time Herr Leni combine drama with fantastic elements, achieving a bizarre and disturbing atmosphere. Again a superb actor, as it happened in the preceding episode steals the picture thanks to his magnetic and fascinating presence.Once again, the d\u00e9cors are outstanding although this time Herr Leni uses these in a \"conventional\" way. That is to say, in order to illustrate in a careful and more realistic way, the characteristics of the Russian empire of the time, the German director leaves the most fantastic aspects of the story for the torture chamber sequences and its terrible ending.The third episode is Expressionism at its best, or maybe this Herr Graf should say that is a homage to Expressionism (on the other hand, the same that happens with the other two episodes in where the main subject are treated in a hyperbolic stylistic way ).This time, the imaginative writer has a terrible nightmare in which he is chased by Spring Heeled Jack. Herr Leni takes advantage of such an oneiric atmosphere in an episode that technically is more complex than the other two. He uses double exposures and special effects in a continuous nightmarish sequence in which quintessential \"Expressionism\" is displayed in an effective and accomplished way.\"Das Wachsfigurenkabinett\" is certainly a condensed version of Herr Leni's artistic achievements. It's an excellent example of his many skillful virtues and stylistic resources, stamped with his particular and fascinating own imaginary.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must remove in a Teutonic way the depilatory wax from the whole body of one of this Herr Graf's rich heiress.", "Three stories, perhaps loosely based on those of O'Henry, set within the clever framing device of a man trying to compose the tales of 3 waxwork figures.  He imagines himself and the owner's daughter in the stories, one of which is an Arabian Nights-type story in which he is a baker who has angered the Sultan (Jannings).  He goes out to steal the Sultan's ring while the Sultan sets out to steal his wife, leaving a waxen copy of himself behind as insurance.  The second story, with Veidt as Ivan the Terrible of Russia caught up in his own murderous schemes, is one-dimensional and obvious compared to the relatively witty first story; the last story, which features the hero and his girl being stalked by Jack the Ripper (Krauss) seems like it's over before it's begun.  Impressive film techniques, but to me this movie is pretty uninspired compared to the better films in the gothic tradition from the period.  The producers were astute in their decision to cast the genre star trio, but they tried too hard to make this movie too much like other films in its class, never letting it breathe its own air.", "This silent German film is one of the first -- if not the first anthology films, as it tells multiple stories comprising fantasy adventure, history and horror. The connecting story is about a writer accepting a job from a waxworks proprietor to write a series of tales about the exhibits in his wax museum, which include Harun al-Rashid, Ivan the Terrible and Jack the Ripper.As a love of portmanteau, it's a thrill to see this film, which influenced Dead of Night and Black Sabbath, two movies that are thought to be the start of the horror anthology genre. And in the words of someone who knows way more about movies than me -- Troy Howarth -- \"Of all the later horror anthologies, it seems to have had the most direct effect on Amicus' Torture Garden, which reused the waxworks motif.\"There's also a moment in the Ivan the Terrible story where the writer claims that the conquerer turned cities into cemeteries, which made me smile and say, \"They will make cemeteries their cathedrals and the cities will be your tombs.\"The film has a great cast with plenty of history, including:Emil Jannings, the first -- and only German -- recipient of the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh. A fictional version of him appears and dies in Inglourious Basterds, which is fitting as Jannings' career ending after appearing in Axis propaganda films. He plays Harun al-Rashid from the Arabian Nights.Conrad Veidt, who plays Ivan the Terrible, is probably best known for playing somnambulist Cesare in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and as the villain in The Man Who Laughs, which inspired the Joker. He was also a powerful medium and occultist in real life who finally went to Hollywood where he appeared in Whistling in the Dark, All Through the NIght, Abobe Suspicion and Casablanca.Werner Krauss, who is both Jack the Ripper and -- spoiler -- Spring Heel Jack, was called the man of a thousand faces, the greatest actor of all time and a demonic genius, which is probably the most fitting description, as he was an unapologetic antisemite who supported the Nazi Party.William Dieterle, who plays the writer, would come to America and make The Life of Emile Zola, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as movies like the film noir films The Accused and Dark City.John Gottowt, the waxworks owner, also played Professor Bulwer, the Van Helsing role in Nosferatu. As a Jewish man, he was kept from making movies when the Nazis took over. He was murdered in 1942 by an SS officer when his disguise as a Roman Catholic priest was discovered.Speaking of Nosferantu, this movie has the same writer, Henrik Galeen.Co-director Paul Leni would make it to Hollywood, where he'd direct the second Charlie Chan movie, The Chinese Parrot, as well as The Man Who Laughs. The other director, Leo Birinsky, would go on to write and direct Flirtation, a precode film about the romantic adventures of a burlesque dancer.The version that played Fantastic Fest has the score interpreted by PRD Mais, \"a collection of young and talented percussionists who combine the rich musical heritage of Brazil with an innovative mindset shaped by a limitless range of contemporary influences.\"Fantastic Fest @ Home is featuring a series of silent films reimagined with the music of five artists from GroundUp music. Beyond this film, there's also Aelita: Queen of Mars with a score by Snarky Puppy's Chris Bullock, Sirintip rescoring The Lost World, PRD Mais taking on Waxworks, Bob Lanzetti covering Nosferantu and House of Waters playing music for Menilmontant, Le Voyage dans la Lune and Ballet Mecanique.", "\"Das Wachsfigurenkabinett\" or \"Waxworks\" is a German silent film from 1924, so over 90 years old by now. Apparently, several versions exist as the runtime is sometimes stated slightly over 60 minutes while the version I watched had a little bit more then 80 minutes. In retrospective, I have to say I'd have preferred the 60-minute version. Birinsky, Leni and especially writer Galeen have worked on some pretty famous films from that era, but their collaboration here did not result in anything memorable. I thought the production values looked pretty weak here for the most part and this already destroyed every chance at a good horror movie because it is so essential for the genre, especially as they could not make up for it via great dialogue for example. The copy I watched was not of great quality, but I guess that's not the filmmakers' fault. At least, I have seen stuff from decades earlier that was more refined. So despite the inclusion of some pretty big names, this one here was a disappointment. I do not recommend watching it.", "Paul Leni's movie \"Das Wachsfigurenkabinett\" (\"Waxworks\" in English) should not be confused with the 1988 horror flick starring \"Gremlins\" star Zach Galligan. This one is about a poet (William Dieterle) who writes some stories based on figures in a wax museum. The ones about Harun al-Rashid and Ivan the Terrible are the most developed, while the one about Jack the Ripper is really hard to understand. In fact, I noticed that the baker in the first segment is named Assad, years before the name became associated with Syria's ruling family.So, if you intend to see the movie, you would probably just do best to watch only the segments about Rashid and Ivan. Lacking the thought-provoking expressionism of \"Nosferatu\" and the epic grandeur of \"Metropolis\", the movie falls a little flat, but isn't terrible by any stretch. Even so, I do recommend 1988's \"Waxwork\" over this one (if only for the cool soundtrack).", "WAXWORKS (1924, original title Das Wachsfigurenkabinett) is another slice of German Expressionism, directed by Paul Leni, who made THE MAN WHO LAUGHS. It has a cast of horror superstars including Werner Krauss (THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI), Emil Jannings (FAUST) and Conrad Veidt (THE HANDS OF ORLAC), and it's an anthology set in a spooky old wax museum to boot. Despite all these attributes, I found it a lesser experience than most silent horrors from this period.For starters, this one leans towards fantasy rather than horror. The wraparound is about a writer who views the exhibits and imagines himself in them. The first story is of ancient Arabia, and an evil sultan pursuing pretty young girls. Fairly light and comedic, it goes on for half the running time. The second is better, with Veidt playing Ivan the Terrible, given over to torture and cruelty until fate steps in. This one's a bit better. The last and most explicitly horrific is about Jack the Ripper hunting down a new victim, but criminally this only lasts a few minutes, so only serves to whet the appetite. I hear a fourth story was planned but cancelled, so I think monetary constraints were at play here. A shame, as the visuals of this period are typically superior.", "I watched the recent (2019) release in the Eureka Masters of Cinema series, \"Waxworks\" (1924) (originally titled \"Wachsfigurenkabinett\"), directed by Paul Leni, with William Dieterle, Olga Belajeff, Emil Jannings, Conrad Veidt, Werner Krauss, Georg John, Ernst Legal, and John Gottowt. An original German release print no longer exists, so this was put together from several other prints, especially the British release, the intertitles of which were the basis for the reconstructed English titles here. Unfortunately, the original was probably at least 20-25 minutes longer, but only the final part of the three part story is truncated in any major way. What's unfortunate about that, however, is the fact that the final segment is by far the most creative and interesting.The restoration is spectacular, with gorgeous tinting and very sharp and clear photography of magnificent expressionistic sets definitely derivative and showily imitative of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920). The plot begins in a carnival where a waxwork display needs stories to tell about the characters represented, the Caliph of Bagdad, Harun al Raschid (Emil Jannings), Ivan the Terrible, Czar (Conrad Veidt), and Spring-Heeled Jack, aka Jack the Ripper (Werner Krauss). William Dieterle plays the writer/poet hired to come up with stories which can be told about the characters in wax to glorify them with horror enough to open the eyes of the patron viewers. Dieterle also plays a baker to the Caliph, a Russian Prince during the Ivan the Terrible segment, and the dreamer of the dream during the Ripper segment. During all these segments Olga Belajeff is the female foil.The show is so very derivative of \"The Cabinet of Caligari\" as to be slightly dull to those who might have seen its inspiring film. The first segment is too long and too slow. The second is slow, too, though Veidt is without question captivating with his magnetic eyes. The last segment is unbelievably imaginative for 1923/4, but, as mentioned, is now only surviving in a truncated version. Its use of multiple exposure is dream-like as it represents exactly that, a dream. The photography overall is the driving force for watching the film. Beautifully done by cinematographer Helmar Lerski, it perfectly imitates \"Caligari\", and even more so captures the bizarre rapture of the sets.Though perfectly acted, aptly directed, photographed to perfection, the overall complex of the film is still dull. It's not stultifying in any sense, but, were it not considered in the framework of 1924 and silent film, this would only be a 5/6 out of 10. As it is, I'd rate it 8 stars out of 10. Jannings is always so good in his films, but here he just gets to be a fat Caliph who acts the fat Caliph with intents that are obvious, movements that are clich\u00e9d, and a story that's told as if to children, but heard before by the adults accompanying them. Veidt is marvelous, but we wonder what the point of the story is. The last story - well, it's told quickly because it's truncated. Who knows? It's still the best.", "These are three O'Henry-like stories with twist endings and although they don't add up to much, they are clever and pass the time.  Jannings as a reprobate Caliph caught in a compromising moment with the baker's wife is humorous, Veidt as Ivan the Terrible caught in an inescapable twist of fate as the victim of his own cruelty and Werner Krauss as a momentary ghost of Jack the Ripper all have their moments. The Jannings story lasts 32 minutes, the Veidt 23 and the Krauss a mere 5.   The most impressive thing visually are the expressionistic sets - the Art Direction deserved at least award consideration.Leni's vision was singular.  Worth seeing as an oddity.", "One of the notable works of the fabled German Expressionist era, \"Waxworks\" (Das Wachsfigurenkabinett) exemplifies the genre's style and look in vivid color. A writer seeking for a job answers an ad in a newspaper. His job there is to create stories based on each waxwork of historical figures in the establishment. As he jots down his yarns he falls for the employer's daughter and he includes her in his tales. The film comprises the enactments of the fantasies. With a nod to \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" the film broods with dark colors and misshapen, messy and distorted sets. The slow, theatrically exaggerated acting adds to the eerie creepiness that pervades the film. Paul Leni showed he was one of the best directors of his time as he brought out some good acting for the time from the thespians involved. The heavy pacing and stilted motions of the actors are too sluggish for modern viewers but the film is good enough to view from start to finish. Haunting and with humor to boot, this representative artifact of its time is one every silent film fan and movie historian should see.", "When a young writer (William Dieterle) sees an advert in the paper requesting somebody with a big imagination, he takes the job and finds himself in a wax museum, where the owner asks him to write stories about his three finest works. His models are of Harun al-Rashid, Ivan the Terrible, and Spring-Heeled Jack, and when Harun's arm accidentally drops off, the writer's imagination starts to wander, and he sets about telling his fantastical tales.Although in essence a horror film, Waxworks is more of an anthology film, juggling genres and tones to fit the mood of the individual piece. While this can be an inventive and successful approach (Creepshow (1982), for example), it can also damage a film's flow if not carefully constructed, risking leaving one story in another's shadow if they also vary in quality. Waxworks suffers for this unfortunately, mainly due to the unevenness in the stories' running times, and the sudden shifts in tone. The stories increase in quality as the film goes on, which is a good thing, but in the case of Waxworks, it leaves a disappointing taste in the mouth given the running time of the final piece is within the blink of an eye.The first story has German silent screen legend Emil Jannings playing Harun al-Rashid, who is informed by his adviser that the most beautiful woman he has ever seen (played by Olga Belajeff) is married to a baker in the city. Rashid goes to win the love of the beauty, but she has set her husband (Dieterle) off to prove himself as a man by stealing the wishing ring from Rashid. Taking a fantasy approach, this story also has a sprinkling of comedy. Jannings if a colossal beast, as you would expect, and brings his dramatic chops to a rarely-seen comedic role. Yet this section drags, and the beautiful expressionist sets don't manage to save it from becoming a silly pantomime.Another German silent icon, Conrad Veidt, plays Ivan the Terrible in the second section, which focuses on Ivan's insane obsession with his potion maker, who can seemingly strike death upon anyone he chooses. It has all the wide-eye operatic tones of Sergei Eisenstein's own Ivan adaptations, with Veidt proving the perfect candidate for Ivan's descent into complete madness. And the final story sees the writer fall asleep at his desk and begin a creepy dream about being stalked by a killer (Werner Krauss) in the streets. It is the final story that remains the most impressive, but sadly only lasts about four minutes.Weimar Germany brought some of the greatest screen icons and most innovative directors in cinema history to the fore during the free- spirited expressionist movement, and although by 1924 the movement was fading away, Waxworks has some fine examples. The winding, claustrophobic staircases of the city streets in the first story evoke the most popular film of the movement, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and in a way, Waxworks almost feels like a homage to Robert Wiene's masterpiece, employing Krauss (who played the titular character) and Veidt who both starred. There is certainly a lot to admire here from a visual standpoint, but even three silent screen giants can't save it from being a slight disappointment, given the promise shown in the final story.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com", "Anthology movies, especially horror ones, have a long history going back to the silent movie era. This sub-genre, where a number of short films are connected by a common theme or thread, are found in films such as 1983's 'Twilight Zone: The Movie,' 1972's 'Tale From the Crypt,' 1982 'Creepshow' among many, many others. They all draw inspiration from the German Expressionist film, November 1924's \"Waxworks.\"Paul Leni, the art and film director for \"Waxworks,\" threaded three tales from the movie's character creative writer (William Dieterle), whose assignment was to compose exciting stories of the famous figures a wax museum had on display. Each were well known historical men with shady backgrounds. Three of the original four are given their stories (the fourth was dropped because of budget tightening) while the third, Jack the Ripper, clocks in at just six minutes because one reel is missing. The writer first tackles a Caliph of Bagdad, the lecherous Harry al-Rashid (Emil Jannings), whose goal is to bed a different woman every night. He hears of a nearby baker's wife who's attractive. He breaks into her house while, coincidentally, the baker is out in an attempt to steal the Caliph's wishing ring to show how much he loves his wife.The second story deals with Ivan the Terrible, whose hobby is to poison people and coordinating their deaths to when the sands run out in an hourglass. Unfortunately for Ivan, he gets poisoned himself, and watches the grains of sand drip downwards. But then he gets a brainstorm and decides to constantly turn the hourglass over again and again and again. He has to personally rotate the glass, otherwise it's curtains.What separates \"Waxworks\" from other semi-horror films is the set design of Leni. Born in Stuttgart, Germany, he became an avant-garde painter, branching out to theater stage design work before employed in the film industry during the Great War. Directing several movies beginning in 1917, his reputation in his set designs was a primary strongpoint. For \"Waxworks,\" Leni said he blueprinted his sets to evoke a sense of unreality, which in turn bores down for his viewers to discover his characters' inner truth.Leni said the set designer \"must penetrate the surface of things and reach their heart. He must create mood even though he has to safeguard his independence with regard to the object seen merely through everyday eyes. It is this which makes him an artist. Otherwise I can see no reason why he should not be replaced by an adroit apprentice carpenter.\"\"Waxworks\" proved to be Leni's last German-made film. So impressed was Carl Laemmle of Universal Pictures that he made an offer to the director to come to the United States, an offer Leni couldn't refuse."], "tt0014602": [], "tt0014826": ["One of a number of 'high brow' pictures made at the time, a simplistic morality tale is used to frame parts of hell as described by Dante and illustrated by Gustav Dore.Mainly of interest for the production design of hell, which seems like a giant factory. The semi-nude bodies of the sinners caused censorship problems at the time.I saw the New York Museum of Modern Art print, which seems to be missing at least twenty percent, supposedly mostly scenes of hell.", "Dante's Inferno (1924)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A meanspirted, heartless father begins reading Dante's Inferno and is soon visited by a demon who shows him what hell is like. Will the father be scared into changing his ways? The father aspect of this is clearly lifted from A Christmas Carol but it works fairly neatly but the real aspect are all the scenes in Hell, which I guess the filmmakers used to make sure people knew they didn't want to go there. It's very easy to see why this thing was so controversial back in the day and it still could have the power to creep people out. Hell is broken down into various rooms and the torture depends on the reason you were sent there. Most memorable are the murderers who are thrown on top of one another with razors so that they will be cut each time they move. The demon that haunts those who commit suicide is another memorable aspect. The print I watched was in horrid shape and didn't have a soundtrack so with the proper elements I'd probably give this a full four stars. I think this was the fifth version of the book.", "1. The Screenplay Writer Edmund Goulding has cleverly woven Dante Alighieri's Inferno and parts of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' storylines into one unique movie.2. Mr Judd a wealthy businessman tycoon & 'Slumlord' refuses to hand out any charitable donations or listen to reason about fire safety hazards in his tenanted properties - which, incidentally does 'Catch-A-Fire'. Mr Judd forces the one person who could save the building into - Eugene Craig, a hospital administrator, neighbour & fellow businessman into bankruptcy. Mr Judd is visited by a demon takes him through the circles of Inferno. Suddenly Mr Judd wakes up from his 'slumber' and it was all just a 'nightmare' dream.3. This 1924 Silent Movie is a sad reminder of how things used to be. The one 'Black' face you see in this Movie is 'The Butler'. But, it's NOT a Black actor, it a 'blacked up' white actor. Whilst Black Actors struggled to find work - let alone decent roles in Movies, because 'blacked up' white actors was seen as a 'politically correct' & more popular move 'Back Then'. The real Black Actors can be seen making or playing music on the radio instrument in the Movie.4. Another sad reflection of the times is that many actors who didn't have leading roles were 'uncredited', as is the case in this movie. The Butler, who is a white actor did not have a leading role & is therefore 'uncredited'.5. What I liked about this movie, is that the Inferno looked like a scary palce to be.", "A preamble from the filmmakers describing Dante Alighieri's 'Inferno' with reference to \"vivid realism\" raises a profoundly skeptical eyebrow; whether they intend the easily mocked pretension of \"fire and brimstone\" preaching or simple dramatic flourishes, the movie proper hasn't even begun and it seems to have aged poorly. Mind you, the concept of the picture is just fine, plainly stirring together the morality tale of Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas carol' with the stark imagery of Dante's vision of Hell. The broad strokes of the plot are quite suitable; Mortimer Judd is even more of a villain than Ebenezer Scrooge, and perhaps more easily compared to the average conservative politician and \u00fcber-rich businessperson in 2023 than a figure of another eighty years' past. But then, too, while this is hardly the only title to employ such an indelicacy, there's also no mistaking the use of blackface here. This is to say nothing of the broad, unsubtle forthrightness of the story as it presents. Not even a quarter of the runtime has passed and Henry Otto's 'Dante's inferno' shows itself to be uneven in various ways, and that impression won't really change.Perhaps it's the notion in Cyrus Wood's story, or the subsequent screenplay of Edmund Goulding, to tell a modern tale on top of the portrayal of Alighieri's Hell. Maybe it's the general ethos that guided the production in various manners. Whatever the case may be, it's hard not to draw comparison to Italian classic 'L'inferno,' produced by Milano Films a full thirteen years before this saw the light of day - and hard not to feel like this is a distinctly lesser creation. It's characterized by a brusqueness that shortchanges the weight of the narrative or imagery; instances of cheapness in the visuals that diminish their intended value or impact; a peculiar estrangement between one element of this feature and the other, or even between this \"Inferno\" and Alighieri's, that subsequently lowers both. So, for example, the artistry we saw in 1911 sometimes seems to have been traded in for empty facades and vague representations more closely resembling the tawdry exploitation flicks that would begin to rear their heads in the 30s. It often seems like the poets aren't so much taking a journey through the abyss as they are jogging through it, and the picture is decidedly lax about any detail in that component of its storytelling. The depiction and description thereof is emphatically simplified and reduced, and made all the poorer for it, sometimes almost laughably so. The active framing half isn't much better, coming off as heavy-handed in its ideas, and a little weak in its communication of those ideas, and in tying them together; the climax is mostly well done, though some moments thereof more so than others. The editing is overly curt, and Otto's direction overzealous; with the latter aspect in mind, the cast sometimes appear to be wildly overacting, even by the standards of an era in which exaggerated facial expressions and body language were not uncommon.I'll at least say this much, those behind the scenes mostly turned in good work. Though the editing is often given to excessive swiftness, those performing the work at least demonstrate swell capability. More substantively, the sets are pretty fantastic, above all the imaginative and laborious efforts that are the locales of Dante and Virgil's sojourn. The costume design is rather terrific, and any effects that are employed tend to look really great. If there's anything about 'Dante's inferno' that's outwardly commendable, it's the work of the crew. With that said, strangely, in all these facets I rather feel that this 1924 movie is inferior to the painstaking endeavor of 1911. Surely that's a question of the ends to which the carpenters, painters, costumers, and effects artists were guided, rather than any reflection of their skills, but still the disparity is noteworthy. It's the difference between a carefully conjured, whimsical panoply of imagery both fantastic and earnestly gnarly, versus an exhibition more closely resembling that of a well-financed theater troupe. To add insult to injury, the lighting in some sequences is kind of poor, restricting what we can actually see of this or that.None of this is to say that this feature is outright bad, because that's not true. But it has difficulty striking a balance between its 'Carol' and its 'Inferno,' and difficulty in making either count and be truly felt by we viewers; both feel insufficient in turn. What I think it comes down to is that in every regard this would have benefited significantly from a more mindful, tactful approach. Not to again draw on a comparison, but the Italian 'L'inferno' was accordingly in production for over three years before its release. I don't know how long it took for this American picture to get made, but it feels in no small part as though it was rushed - developed quickly and incompletely. The big ideas are there, but not the rounding details that would make them matter, nor the fastidious craftsmanship that would help the imagery or storytelling to really make a mark. Thus, while it seems splendid from the outside, once we sit to watch and actively track what it's doing and how it's constructed, the viewing experience becomes less than fully satisfying. I still think 'Dante's inferno' is reasonably worthwhile, but it's nothing remarkable, and nothing for which one needs to go out of their way. There are plenty of other films that should be a higher priority for any viewer, and one of them is thirteen years older. Still, if you have the chance to watch and appreciate the silent era, it's a decent enough way to spend one's time.", "A selfish businessman has been consumed with the sins that will throw him to hell. He allows his tenants in his ramshackle tenement houses suffer in unsafe living conditions with no remorse. When a demon shows him what hell is like and offers him a chance to save his soul, the businessman is faced with a choice, but old habits die hard.Although Dante's Inferno has some great visuals, the story lacks, and therefore makes this curiosity quite disappointing. This was one of the most exciting names on the list for Cinevent 41, and I was underwhelmed by it. The red tinting and the writhing bodies are powerful at first sight, but the narration dwells too much on the details of each level of hell. Maybe this is uninteresting to modern audiences who have been saturated with so many different varieties of what hell might be like that we're numb to the older renditions. Whatever the reason, it is not effective.It is worthwhile to note that the black characters are played by white men in black-face. This choice is more startling today than it must have been when the film was originally released, but it serves as a reminder of the change in the times.This film intertwines the imagery from Dante's famous story and a modern morality tale that plays off of the depictions of hell. Cecil B. DeMille perfected this combination in The Ten Commandments a year earlier. In comparison, Dante's Inferno falls flat.", "It may not be possible to bring the Inferno to the screen:  too much depends on Dante's poetry, not to mention familiarity with all of the classical and contemporary references that mean so much to the poet's journey.  But the people who made this film didn't even try; instead, they gave us a version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol, with a little diluted Sinclair Lewis thrown in, relocated in 1920's America. Yes we do get some scenes from the Inferno, but all the drama of the original has been drained from them:  the lustful appear to be merely lounging around in a reddish scene, instead of being caught up in a whirlwind, while the suicides are now thorny bushes with heads, which simply look ridiculous.But the question remains:  could we do better with modern special effects? The danger is that the effects could be too good--Bertran de Born swinging his head like a lantern, Mohammed and the other schismatics split nearly in half, suicides turned into brambles, thieves turned into lizards--leaving the impression that the Inferno is just a series of freak shows, and giving too little importance to the transformation of Dante as he journeys through Hell.

It took me some time to warm up to the film: the pace is extremely sluggish (the aftermath of the train-wreck at the beginning seemed interminable), while the all-important decision to exchange the damaged hands of famed concert pianist Orlac with those of a murderer felt too abrupt.In preparation for this review, I re-read Michael Elliott's comments on the film: while I generally concur with his opinion, at this stage I wouldn't put this above the 1935 Karl Freund/Peter Lorre/Colin Clive remake MAD LOVE (Ted Healy's intrusive comedy relief, to me, is just about the only negative element in that film \u0096 while adding Dr. Gogol's obsessive yearning for Orlac's wife, hence the new title). Still, I was surprised by how much the later film actually followed the Silent version \u0096 especially the two scenes in which Orlac meets the 'executed' murderer \u0096 of the Maurice Renard story; another remake appeared in 1960, co-starring Christopher Lee and which I watched on Italian TV not too long ago but already can hardly remember anything about it!Conrad Veidt's lanky figure and stylized approach to acting perfectly suited the requirements of the leading role (his posture generally echoing that of Cesare the Somnambulist in the same director's THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI [1919]); the expressionist sets were also notable but the film's style is generally an internalized one in that it deals primarily with Orlac's state of mind filming him in tight shots whenever possible. However, the avant-garde score which accompanied the Grapevine Video edition I watched was a matter of taste \u0096 featuring a female vocalist who frequently attempted to simulate the various characters' emotions with an annoying array of wails, shrieks and faint whispers!It's unfortunate, too, that the backlog I have of unwatched films on DVD doesn't permit me to check out the Kino edition of CALIGARI for the moment \u0096 especially since it contains a lengthy condensed version of another intriguing Wiene title, GENUINE: A TALE OF A VAMPIRE (1920)", "The pianist Paul Orlac (Conrad Veidt) is on tour and his wife Yvonne Orlac (Alexandra Sorina) anxiously waits for his return.

Meanwhile, the robber and murderer Vasseur that claims that is innocent is sentenced to death since the police investigator had found his fingerprints everywhere near the victim. Dr. Serral transplants Vasseur's hands in Orlac and when he recovers, he feels that there is something wrong with his hands.Orlac asks the surgeon about the hands and learns that he belonged to a criminal, and Orlac decides to never touch Yvonne again with those hands.

Sooner they discover a secret about Vasseur.\"Orlacs H\u00e4nde\" is a Gothic and dark German Expressionist film with an unbelievable plot (but who matters?) but wonderful theatrical performances like in most silent classics and perfect use of shadows in a gloomy atmosphere. The music score fits perfectly to the film and this is the first time that I watch this little masterpiece. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"As M\u00e3os de Orlac\" (\"The Hands of Orlac\")", "I've been looking for a DVD of THE HANDS OF ORLAC ever since I knew the film existed. Now it's finally here, and like most silent films it's a mixed bag. I find the image on the new KINO disc to be acceptable considering the problematic nature of the source material. There's a loss of definition in some scenes, but there are also moments of sharpness in the restored Murnau Foundation print. It's a shame we can never experience non-talking films the way 1920s audiences did, without washed-out contrasts, image-flickers, frame-jitters, dirt, and print damage. Even the best restorations don't look new.The plot concerns a concert pianist whose hands are smashed in a train wreck. A surgeon replaces them with the hands an executed criminal. Soon the pianist is obsessed with thoughts he might be a killer. The performances are generally excellent in the Expressionistic style. Conrad Veidt's exaggerated grimacing as his character Paul Orlac approaches madness is tempered by moments that are extremely moving.The score of mostly string music on the KINO disc is creepy and works well for a while, but is so monotonous over the entire length of an already ponderously paced film that I grew tired of it. This film cries out for music that varies its mood to fit what is happening on screen. Contrasts in the mood of the music would make the creepy parts seem even creepier. An optional score in a traditional style would have been nice. Nevertheless, the Gothic set design and shadow-infested cinematography by Gunther Krampf - particularly the scenes at Orlac's father's house - create the atmosphere we know and love in early horror films. These chiaroscuro light-and-shadow effects just cannot be achieved with color.However, to evoke fear without the modern cheats of gore and violence - to create what the Germans call \"stimmung\" (mood) - requires not only imaginative lighting and set design, but time. Unfortunately director Robert Weine spends too much time on the actors' very deliberate expressionistic movements at the expense of pacing.The ending is likewise unsatisfactory, although it does follow Maurice Renard's novel. I won't give too much away other than to say the ending undercuts an apparently fantastic element, yet makes the \"logical\" explanation seem almost as implausible. Nevertheless, the build-up to the resolution as well as Veidt's engrossing performance makes this a worthwhile, if uninspired, film.", "Interesting and well made German silent version of Maurice Renard's novel \"Les Mains d'Orlac\" from the same folks behind the highly regarded expressionist classic THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1920). Conrad Veidt gives an outstanding, creepy and memorable dramatic performance as the tormented Orlac, a famous pianist whose hands are replaced by those of an executed thief and murderer after a train accident. He soon begins to think he's not only received a maniac's hands, but also his desire to commit crimes. The cavernous and sparsely decorated interiors as well as the typically exaggerated performances often give this the feel of a theatrical production, and while the movie is a little overlong and slow-going (definitely requires a more patient type of viewer to appreciate it), it's still worthwhile for Veidt's amazing performance, some nice visuals and a surprise twist ending. I also need to point out that the Kino DVD of the film runs 110 minutes, though it is listed here as running just 98. Bonus features on the disc include scene comparisons of domestic and international cuts, excerpts of Renard's Novel, an essay by author John Soister, a trailer and an image gallery.The same tale would later be the basis for 1935's MAD LOVE (starring the inimitable Peter Lorre) and 1960's THE HANDS OF ORLAC (starring Mel Ferrer, and also with supporting turns from Christopher Lee and Donald Pleasence), as well as the uncredited basis for 1962's HANDS OF A STRANGER and several other films.", "Hands of Orlac, The (1924)*** (out of 4)This German version of the famous story is certainly a lot better than the boring 1961 version with Christopher Lee and is also a step up from the more famous 1935 film Mad Love with Peter Lorre. As the story goes, a concert pianist (Conrad Veidt) has his hands damaged during a train wreck but doctor's do a transplant and accidentally give him the hands of a killer. Soon afterwards the hands take on a life of their own and start killing. Here's another German Expressionism horror film that really takes control of the viewer and takes them for a ride. The director, Robert Wiene, also made the masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and this film serves as one of the more chilling silent horror films. The best aspect is the performance from Veidt who I found just as good here as he was in The Man Who Laughs. He's able to get sympathy out of the character and he also manages to be very menacing during the murder scenes. The film also has some very eerie and creepy moments including the first scene where the hands come to life. This is a rather rare film and various versions are out there. I was able to view the longest cut of the film (93 minutes) but the title cards were in German with Spanish subs. The music score was also quite horrid so I actually turned the sound off while watching this. With a proper screening I'd certainly raise the rating.", "One of the real classics of Expressionism -- even the Americans think so, to judge from the fact that they've remade it (badly) several times.  To be sure, the premise won't stand examination (but then, it's horror), and a modern viewer may find it hard to adjust to the actors' Expressionist grimacing.  However, the movie is consistently suspenseful due to its heavy dark atmosphere and communication of mental torment.  The fear of one's own body is a dynamite theme if it's as well presented as it is here.", "Flirting with a (then) science fictional theme of body part transplantation, the film explores the feelings of a concert pianist, who having lost his hands in a train wreck, receives a new pair of hands that belonged to an executed murderer. Austrian director Robert Weine, who created the landmark 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' (1919) here reunites with and directs its star, Conrad Veidt, as the tormented pianist Paul Orlac.The camera focuses on Veidt's many moods and reactions to his plight -- his hands are not capable of his concert abilities, and he feels that they are taking him over with thoughts and deeds of crime and murder. He does an outstanding job, but too much of the film is slowly paced. From the beginning extended train crash rescue, on through scene after scene of Orlac's, his wife's and the maid's over the top Expressionistic gesturing, the scenes seem to go on too long.This slow pace is exaggerated by the lack of camera movement (everything is mostly wide shots with little tracking), the wonderfully and effectively spooky new musical score (on the KINO 2008 version), that sometimes lacks verve and variety, as well as the extensive time spent on the actors' Expressionist movements.The film certainly has its high points. It's great to see an entire film shot in shadows and low light, all with Gothic sets. This is great German Expressionism. If you can relax and just go with the pace of the film, you can really enjoy the acting of Conrad Veidt-- whose hands keep getting creepier and scarier.If it were cut to about sixty minutes to pick up the pace, it would be easier to enjoy and to see the great care that went into its creation and execution.I'll have to give it a six.", "A famous pianist (Conrad Veidt) has his hands crushed in a train accident, and he receives new ones through an experimental transplant. But whose hands were they before? The hands of a killer!This is a rather long film, probably more than it needs to be. The train wreck shots are beautiful, but go on a while, with the story being relatively simple.The focus here is more on Orlac's mental state, and less on the others in any way, with the love affair angle of \"Mad Love\" (its remake) completely absent. For fans of \"Mad Love\", this picture needs to be respected, as they clearly borrowed scenes (noticeably where Orlac meets his donor), but \"Mad Love\" is the superior film in many ways.", "Ah, what aristocratic days are these!!... These modern times of the new 21st century have many similarities to the old youthful times that Herr Graf spent in Deutschland at the beginning of the ancient 20th century; that is to say, during those days the world had a tremendous financial crisis not to mention the menace of a world flu pandemic. It seemed appropriate then that Herr Von decided to revisit those memories by watching at the Schloss theatre a strange, oppressive film, a picture that reflected those times and the aristocratic mood. A perfect soir\u00e9e, indeed!... The film was \"Orlacs H\u00e4nde\" (1924) by Herr Robert Wiene.It was a pleasure ( you have to know that German aristocrats have fun in a different and dark way .. ) to watch again such a classic Expressionist masterpiece. Thanks are owed to the longhaired youngsters at Kino who did an excellent restoration of this old nitrate which includes a bearable music score by Herr Paul Mercer that helps one to suppress the memory of the terrible score that was included some time ago in another release of the film; that music was scarier than the film itself.Even today, to watch \"Orlacs H\u00e4nde\" is a disturbing experience aside from appreciating its Expressionist values. Early in the film, the train crash sequence is full of dark and impressive shots that capture the confusion, warning the audience that this is a special oeuvre. It bespeaks a terrible chaos, uncertainty and darkness that engulfs the viewer in an oppressive, tormented atmosphere.Due to the train crash, Herr Orlac ( Herr Conrad Veidt ) our hero will suffer horrible wounds to body and soul. The physical scars heal up but the psychological wounds are more difficult to overcome, especially when Herr Orlac discovers that his new hands belonged to an assassin. This marks the beginning of a terrible \"tour de force\" between body and soul that will torment Herr Orlac throughout the film. His fragility is challenged by pain and suffering and though solace and calm ultimately prevail he must first face constant uncertainty, delirium and the threat of insanity.The Expressionist shadows, appropriately enough, surround the main characters ( The performances by the great Herr Veidt and Dame Alexandra Sorina are also in the Expressionist manner ) and their habitats; their home, at the hospital, and in the streets. An oppressive, morbid, gloomy atmosphere prevails and suits perfectly a story of wicked impulses and disturbed minds.Hands demanding crimes, the weakness of the human will, blackmail from an unscrupulous criminal, a medical experiment, a father who hates his son\u0085 such are the subjects in \"Orlacs H\u00e4nde\", an unnerving masterpiece and the perfect aristocratic silent film choice for a cloudy soir\u00e9e in these 21st uncertain times.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must lend a hand in this time of crisis by drinking only a glass of Rhine white wine instead of the whole bottle.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/", "I much prefer watching the Peter Lorre remake, MAD LOVE ('35) which tells the same tale of the pianist who has his hands replaced by those of a murderer after an accident severs them. At least that version had some pace, some sense of cinematic flow and was not subjected to the wild silent screen acting that all but consumes THE HANDS OF ORLAC.Even a great actor like CONRAD VEIDT cannot save this one from looking absurd much of the time. The players all suffer from silent screen direction which means they hold their frantic poses for long stretches of time while the camera focuses only on them.Even the train wreck scene suffers from lengthy excesses before the camera even gets to the victim. You almost feel like saying, \"C'mon, let's get to the point,\" before the scene is over.Frankly, I found it an insufferable silent film, a poorly paced example of German expressionism in a film full of shadows and static camera shots.", "There is nothing creepier than watching a 1924 German Expressionist silent film. While, this movie didn't had those wildly non-realistic, geometrically absurd sets. We did get those designs motifs painted on walls and floors to represent lights, shadows, and objects. It doesn't have gore, or much violent, it deals with the \"stimmung\" type mood of madness, insanity, and betrayal. Directed by Robert Wiene of 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' fame, the movie follows the plot of the story, 'Les Mains d'Orlac' by Maurice Renard. The film was one of the first film to feature, hands having a will of their own, whether if it's attached to the body or not. Such fear, came from the ignorance by the public on the then-new subject of surgical transplants. I love how the film is shot. There's a constant intercutting between close-and medium-shots to extreme long shots of these excessively large rooms, with large expanses of empty space. It's a metaphor of the main character's existential distress and then a giant hand coming out to reach him. The hand dreams are pretty scary even with today's standards. The movie is about a gifted Concert pianist, Paul Orlac (Conrad Veidt) whom on his way to visit his wife, Yvonne (Alexandra Sorina) lose his hands in a horrible train crash. His wife Yvonne pleads with the surgeon to try and save Orlac's hands. Instead, the surgeon decides to transplant new hands onto Orlac. Orlac recovers from the crash, only to find out that he is unable to play the piano. Not only that, but Orlac starts to be tortured by memories of a recent murder in the community. He finds himself, going mad, whenever he is in the presence of a knife. Such a presence, has cause him to want to kill and cause violence. He starts to believe that the hands, he got are the hands of a murderer and he has to find a way to stop it. I think without a lot of make up or any real special effects. For a silent film star, Veidt is great in this with his body language. Some scenes might seem a bit over acting, but for the most part, Veidt manages to make the film into an intense thriller. The movie makes you think, if it's all in his head, or is he really killing people? As humans, we've always been fascinated superstitiously by the way our own bodies work and where our own consciousness lies. The movie borderlines the themes of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The movie also reminds me of Faust. This movie was often remade. The most famous version is 1935's Mad Love. Other films, follow are 1962's Hands of a Stranger, 1946's The Beast with Five Fingers, and 2012's Les Mains de Roxana. It also loosely adapted in Oliver Stone's 1981's The Hand. It also seem to appear in the Futurama season four finale episode 18th, 'The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings'. The movie is a bit rare, so finding it, might be a challenge. The movie is in the public domain, so there is a lot of DVD versions to choose upon. Depending what version, you find depends on how good the film preservation, or film restoration. Surprising, the movie copy version, I watch was pretty good. It had little scratches, decay, dirt, or film grain. That doesn't mean that your version will be as good as mine. Some version had the original film cut to some extent by the German government at the time, then Nazis later on, due to censoring as they felt that it endanger public safety and order. They thought it could be used as a tool for criminals because it show a realistic method of forging fingerprints. While, the movie was made before there was a rating system, there was age limit for people to see this film. I think it's less about the frighten horrors, and more on what the hands represented. There is a sexual motif that get established right at the start with how Orlac's wife would be touch by his hands. The original German inter-titles have an even more erotic tone to it. The hands represent the sex life between husband and wife in the film symbolism. In 1996, the film was re-evaluated and released, with PG or PG-13 age limit rating. In my opinion, it's might frighten little children if watch. The original version is about 92 minutes long, while the reconstructed version is 90 minutes. The restored version with all the cut scenes is 113 min. So make sure, you're getting the full version. Some versions had newly inserted music scores by Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, Henning Lohner, Paul Mercer, Donald Sosin, Dennis James or others. Background noises might be missing in some version. Make sure, you can hear the sound effects during the interrogation scene. The version, I had also had English sub-titles. Many of the versions are sadly, just in German or in some other European language. In no way, should you ever watch a color version. Its takes away the German Expressionist feel to film. You would never notice the shadow-infested cinematography by Gunther Krampf particularly the scenes at Orlac's father's house. I love the use of Chiaroscuro using a stark contrast between dark and light in an image, usually for dramatic effect in some scene. You would deeply be sadly if you watch it in color. The Kino version is one of the better video transfer from the source material, so check that out if you want. You can also find the film on Youtube. The ending is mixed feelings, although it does follow Maurice Renard's novel, it's not the best. Another fault of the film would be its pacing. Overall: A great watch. You got to get your hand on this.", "THE HANDS OF ORLAC is an exceptional German silent film and was remade in Hollywood just a few years later as MAD LOVE (starring another German, Peter Lorre). Both are well worth seeing, as they are quite different in how they portray the leading character.The film begins with a pianist (Conrad Veidt) having his hands tragically severed in an accident. However, in an amazing bit of surgery, the hands of an executed man are grafted seamlessly onto Orlac. Oddly, however, the pianist is haunted by the ghost of this dead man and the hands seem to have a mind of their own--with a strong desire to kill!!During all this film, Veidt overacts horribly--even for a silent film. In many ways, he acts much like the main character from THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI--a famous German Expressionist film made almost a decade earlier. For a 1919 film, this wasn't a problem, but by 1924 this sort of acting was becoming a bit pass\u00e9. While not bad, you can't deny that he over-emotes here and there.Despite this over-emoting, the film is quite exciting and well-paced. The horror film has some wonderful twists and turns that keep the audience guessing and the excitement never lets up until the very end. One of the better silent films and fortunately the DVD print is top quality.", "I thought they would never get the guy out of the train after the crash. There is ten minutes of useless footage. Of course, it is an early silent film, so I was OK with the long dramatic poses. Conrad Veidt is about as spooky as one can be and his wife is a close second. I wonder why they never mentioned the procedure for putting another man's hands in place of his. He is suddenly in the hospital and knows all about it. This is a classic horror piece that has been done many times. In a later incarnation, the hands get up and act on their own, sort of like the Addams family Thing. At times it is hard to follow because there is virtually no sound editing. As a matter of fact, they could have trimmed twenty to thirty minutes, had a relatively long film, and made it much more accessible. I love silent films and don't regret wading through this one.", "This is not a great movie, I admit. Certainly the acting is bizarre (though often moving) and the rhythm takes getting used to. But I thought I would put in a good word based on a recent viewing experience. I am not rating it high but I really enjoyed it a lot.6 or 7 years ago I went on a Conrad Veidt spree and bought copies of some his silents from an ebay seller/devotee. The quality varied and I recall that he particularly apologized for this item, which was barely viewable. All you could really see was Veidt's face... The other night TCM showed the Kino restoration and I sat down to see the film \"for real.\" It was a pleasure to be able to take in the wonderful decors and costumes, and to get a relatively coherent version of the plot. The train wreck scene is stirring. And Veidt's face, again, as he progresses from sensitive soul to tormented monstrosity... In short, it was very rewarding.", "I saw Orlacs H\u00e4nde at the Ghent filmfestival this year with a live score. I must say I thought it was very good, although I didn't agree with the new score all the time... The story is both simple and ridiculous (like any good scare movie): A world renown pianist loses his hands in a trainaccident and gets a transplant from a convicted criminal. The hands of course take over or do they. This film does not excell in great acting or storytelling but more in the subtle building of an atmosphere that becomes so haunting that it nearly becomes unbearable. If you like horror movies from the silent age, without blood or gore but with loads of atmosphere, then this is an absolute must-see.", "The first name people spontaneously think about when referring to films from the silent era is that of Lon Chaney \"The Phantom of the Opera\", \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", \"The Unholy Three\"...). Although he was undeniably brilliant, I personally feel the greatest horror actor from the silent era was Conrad Veidt. Thanks to his legendary roles in \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" and \"The Man Who Laughs\", Veidt proved (to me, at least) that someone can look ultimately menacing and terrifying without producing a single spoken word. This man's dark and penetrating eyes, as well as his mysterious charisma, represent the oldest form of cinematic horror as far as I'm concerned. For this reason, I put \"Orlac's H\u00e4nde\" on my wish list. The story has been made into several different films, including by the Hammer Studios during the sixties, but I desperately wanted to see Veidt in the role of the tormented pianist who, after a terrible accident, receives the hands of an executed murderer via a transplant operation. The hands don't want to play music but still desire to commit vile crimes, or at least Orlac believes they do.I watched a beautifully restored version of \"Orlac's H\u00e4nde\" with a running time of 112 minutes, which is a lot long that the times mentioned here on the website. I'm not sure if any footage, that perhaps once was considered lost, got added. Even though the picture quality is impeccable, and the story utmost fascinating, I can't deny the film should have been 30-40 minutes shorter. Certain scenes, like the footage of the train wreck near the beginning, or some of Orlac's anxiety outbursts last much longer than necessary. Still, Veidt carries the entire film masterfully, and particularly the climax is very tense.Even in real life, Veidt was a genuine hero, since he despised the upcoming Nazi regime in his home country and refused to work in the business under the dictatorship of Goebbels. He emigrated to the States, where he surely still could have made a great career (he even appeared in \"Casablanca\") but, sadly, died prematurely from a heart-attack in 1943 at the age of 50.", "There has been more than one film adaptation of Maurice Renard's novel 'Les Mains d'Orlac' of 1920. There are those of Karl Freund, Edmond T. Greville and someone called Newt Arnold but in the humble opinion of this reviewer nothing can begin to match the atmosphere and emotional power of the version directed by one of the masters of German Expressionism Robert Wiene.\nSome critics have drawn attention to the 'operatic' style of acting but surely that is part and parcel of the genre.\nThe mental and emotional torture of pianist Paul Orlac and his wife are wonderfully expressed by Conrad Veidt and Alexandra Sonna. The scene where he embraces his beloved piano and tries to play for the first time after leaving hospital whilst his heartbroken wife looks on is simply magnificent. The scene across the table at the inn between Orlac and Nerra, played by Fritz Kortner, is excellent.\nAs for the film itself the lighting, framing and composition of scenes is exceptional. Wiene was a master of the visual and here has the talents of Gunther Krampf as Cinematographer and Stefan Wessely as Art Director.\nYes, this is a horror film but also a work of art.\nThe version I saw recently was even more effective having been spared the curse of the 'specially composed' score. Gott sei Dank!", "Previous writers have covered the plot of this film pretty comprehensively. My copy is poor, visually, but has a score made up of preludes and fugues, trio sonatas and chorale preludes by J.S Bach played on the organ and including, in the confrontation between Orlac and \"Vasser\", the Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV565).This has no connection with the plot of the film, but makes for a decent recital in its own right. This copy, from English Language Video, is made up of the best bits of three prints from various sources with renewed intertitles. This means that the tale seems to lack logic and continuity, however, enough remains to hold the interest and to point up the films origins in the expressionist school. Veidt's portrayal of Orlac's descent into near insanity occasionally draws on Cesare,the somnambulist of \"Dr. Caligari\" but the story does not have the depth or psychology of the wider impressionist canon. In all, a curiosity but little else, even for fans of Conrad Veidt.", "I realize this movie was a true original. Well, kind of, anyway. Maurice Renard wrote the novel in 1920, and he wrote the original mixed-up transplant novel in 1908 about organs being transplanted not just from human to human but to animals, plants, and even machines. One wonders what it must have been like to be Maurice Renard's room mate. But, in fact, maybe the whole business began with Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" and lasted at least through the latest version of \"The Fly\" and \"Robocop.\" Anyway, yes, I realize the film is an original and that it was directed by the same guy, Robert Wiene, who had earlier given us \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\" which I truly believe was dreamed up on some kind of amusement park ride.But, man, this is one slow slog. Example: Conrad Veidt as Orlac has discovered his hands have been transplanted from a murderer and he sits brooding on the couch. Behind him stands his wife, Alexandra Sorina, staring at him without his realizing that she's there. I tried to time the motionless scene in which she stares at his back and he sits, but my LED clock was in shadow and I couldn't read it. It must be thirty full seconds. Nothing happens. Finally she drops -- verrry slowwwly -- to her knees and creeps towards him until she's able to nuzzle his hand. Veidt jerks it away in disgust.I hate modern movies that are stylishly edited so that each shot lasts a fraction of a second, but this was like watching actors move inside a huge vat of corn syrup. Sorina overacts too. Everybody is expected to overact in a silent movie but this goes a bit over the edge. Veidt, the central figure, has a handle on his role and projects emotions exquisitely. The doctor too reins himself in, though that doesn't stop him from looking like a chump from the Keystone Cops.There's none of the loop-the-loop quality of \"Dr. Caligari.\" There aren't any surprises in the set dressing or the story itself, once we get the picture. Although it's dark, it's been beautifully photographed. Superb use is made of lights in night-for-night shots. The musical score is hard to assess. It sounds like The World Saxophone Quartet for strings, full of extended shimmering dissonant chords and occasional weird shrieks and squeaks. I kind of enjoyed it.It was more or less remade ten years later as \"Mad Love\" with Peter Lorre in the role of a crazed doctor who performs the transplants. The victim is treated coincidentally. \"Mad Love\" goes nuts at the end. At least this one is grounded, given the initial fantastic premise.But, mind you, it IS slow.", "\"Orlacs H\u00e4nde\" or \"Orlac's Hands\" is a black-and-white silent film from over 90 years ago. It was directed by Robert Wiene, the man behind the famous Caligari movie. In its original version, the film ran roughly 90 minutes, but the new version I saw has over 110 minutes, probably because of less frames per second. Anyway, Conrad Veidt is one of Germany's most known silent film actors, so he certainly can carry a film like this. His most known role is probably in \"Casablanca\". In my opinion, the idea was nice in here. A piano player has a terrible accident and loses both his hands. A surgeon gives him a new pair, but these are from a convicted and executed murderer. By now, you probably know that this is a mystery/horror film. The ending just takes it to another level. Yes it was fairly absurd that somebody else got the killer's head and now this was some meat puzzle story, but at least something interesting happened. This thrill near the end, however, is not enough to sit through almost 2 hours of this film. I am generally not the biggest silent film fan, so my opinion may be biased, but i found it a boring watch for the most part. This film did not get me interested in silent movies. Not recommended.", "Robert Wiene is best known for directing The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, but this is yet another masterwork. It's been remade four times, as Mad Love in 1935, The Hands of Orlac, Hands of a Stranger in 1962 and Body Parts in 1991. They all are versions of the 1920 novel Les Mains d'Orlac by French writer Maurice Renard.It also was kind of sort of remade as The Hand, The Beast With Five Fingers, The Crawling Hand, Les Mains de Roxana and segments in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors and Body Bags.Concert pianist Paul Orlac (Conrad Veidt) loses his hands in an accident only to receive a transplant of the hands from an executed murderer, a fact that begins to drive him insane. The surgeon tries to tell him that a person is not governed by hands, but by the head and heart. But Paul knows - he's now obsessed by the idea of killing someone.Now that he can no longer play piano, Orlac is destitute. He goes to ask his father for money, only to find him stabbed by the same knife the killer once used. It gets worse. He's unsure if he killed his father or not, so he goes to drink, and meets a man who claims to be the killer. Could the surgeon have transplanted a new body on the hands of the killer? Perhaps. But whomever the man is, he begins to blackmail Orlac.There's a twist which I won't give away - why spoil a movie that's 98 years old - but this movie is still a great watch so many years later.", "Director Robert Wiene and star Conrad Veidt reteam for this Austrian horror suspense drama. Veidt plays Paul Orlac, a famous concert pianist who gets severely injured in a train crash. Dr. Serral (Hans Homma) tries an experimental technique wherein he grafts the hands of a dead man onto Orlac's arms, and the surgery is a success, but afterward, when Orlac learns that the hands belonged to an executed murderer, he starts to lose his mind, believing that the hands are commanding him to kill again. Also featuring Alexandra Sorina, Fritz Strassny, Paul Askonas, Carmen Cartellieri, and Fritz Kortner.Wiene continues to use Expressionistic techniques and visual schemes, but they are toned down, and used to accentuate the narrative rather than overwhelming the proceedings. The film marks an important step in the transition from purely arthouse Expressionism to the techniques used in the visual language of film noir. Veidt gives an intense, tortured performance, although Kortner pales in comparison to the later remake Mad Love and Peter Lorre's take on the character. Most sources list this as being roughly 90 minutes, but the version I watched was 113 minutes. I felt that could have been trimmed down a bit, as some scenes dragged. That being said, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, and the cinematography was beautiful.", "I must say I was pretty disappointed while watching this one. It's one of the classic movies from the age of German Expressionism, but I cannot call this a masterpiece. Wiene was a director of remarkable \"Kabinett des Doktor Caligari\" and \"Orlacs H\u00e4nde\" doesn't seem to be as successful as this great picture. The action is quite interesting, acting is very good, idea is inspiring but it's also very naive. Specially the ending was too childish and I found myself hard to believe in it. But, I should also admit that Wiene's movie has some kind of intriguing atmosphere, which makes the whole thing worth watching. If you're enthusiastic to German cinema of the decade you should watch this one, but don't expect too much.", "It's hard to truly judge or compare, being nearly 100 years removed, but the production design in 'The hands of Orlac' readily impresses as rather grandiose. The orchestration of the opening scene is pretty great, with many extras, complex set pieces, and a number of moving parts. Beyond that, set design and decoration is swell, plus costume design, and more. Makeup artists also did fine work here, allowing actors' facial expressions to appear still more vivid in an era when lack of sound and dialogue required especially robust visual presentation.The whole cast readily demonstrates their talents, including Alexandra Sorina as Orlac's wife Yvonne, struggling under the building pressures and destitution of the situation the couple find themselves in. But Conrad Veidt is the real star by all means, giving great life to beleaguered pianist Paul Orlac. With pointedly exaggerated body language and nuanced expressions, Veidt very capably embodies the abhorrence Orlac feels in his predicament, the terrible portent he believes his new appendages bear, and his troubled mental state. With that said, in no small measure 'The hands of Orlac' could be described as psychological horror as Orlac wrestles with murderer Vasseur's influence, real or imagined, and it's all the more riveting to watch Veidt as such.In addition to the star's performance, that latter slant is further cemented with some wonderfully rendered scenes like an intense nightmare, replete with marvelous editing, or tight close-up shots of Orlac's mitts. The character writing is fantastic, and scenes at large are penned and perpetrated with an expert hand. I think there are several instances where some rounding aspects of plot development would have benefited from greater clarity and more careful consideration, such as the abundant spilling of plot we get in the last minutes. Yet overall the execution is so good, and the story sufficiently solid, that minor shortcomings don't substantially detract from our experience.As is often true of genre pictures from cinema's early history, the sense of horror in the tale is more thematic than anything else, and not at all visceral. Yet the subject matter is disquieting nonetheless, and certainly removed from more straightforward comedies and dramas that populated theaters, most of all in the 1920s. It has its faults, yet much more so than not this is filled with compelling storytelling, fine film-making, and strong performances to realize a yarn with a clever, somewhat cerebral thrust that even today remains a relatively niche sub-genre. Save perhaps for those viewers who have difficulty with psychological horror or silent films as a style, 'The hands of Orlac' is an imperfect but very enjoyable slice of early movie history that's well worth watching if one has the opportunity.", "Orlacs H\u00e4nde / The Hands Of Orlac (1924) :\nBrief Review -Hands down for the mind-blowing concept. A well made dark mystery thriller. The Hands Of Orlac is definitely one of the finest concept came out during 20s decade and when we look at the thrilling and suspenseful atmosphere, it is even better. I just loved the concept. What a writing it was! Hands down for the pathbreaking thinking. A world-famous pianist loses both hands in an accident. When new hands are grafted on, he doesn't know they once belonged to a murderer. This leads to disastrous consequences and then reveals a mind-boggling suspense at the end. You see, there is a metaphorical touch to the script. A man who loves his hands more than anything in this world starts hating it and his fine world is turned upside down. The metaphor here is, Body driving to the Soul. An organ just can't be judged by physical refrences, but the mental concentration is what makes it a complete part of body. The soul needs to accept it too not just body. Well, this is my point of view of looking at it, one might differ. Anyways, the film is fantastic throughout the content build up. Yes, it is little slow but that doesn't harm much when you realise the time when it was made. The silent era was more about the content and new ideas than the pace of the film. I liked Conrad Veidt's performance. How easily he got into the character carrying all the dark shades and different mental situations. Fritz Kortner looked dangerous as required for the villain's role. Robert Wiene who earliest delivered a Masterpiece like 'The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari' hit the same shot again. Although it was little short than the earlier masterpiece, the overall formation was very close depite tough conditions. Overall, a Brilliant Dark Thriller with an innovative concept.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest"], "tt0015404": [], "tt0015449": [], "tt0015771": [], "tt0016123": ["A belittled clerk uses his ingenuity as an amateur detective to track down THE MONSTER responsible for some rather eerie recent disappearances.This is a wonderfully creepy silent film. With very good acting & excellent production values courtesy of MGM, it is too bad this movie is not better known. The large amounts of humor help to lighten the load considerably and are very welcome.The Master, Lon Chaney, adds another portrait to his gallery of grotesques. Slyly underplaying his character and letting his marvelous face act for him, Chaney more than makes up for the fact that his role is rather small. It is certainly ironic that this gentle man & terrific actor should be remembered principally for his bizarre & monstrous creations.Comic Johnny Arthur receives co-star billing with Chaney and he deserves it, since he carries the bulk of the action. He does a fine job with his character, giving him backbone & spunk rather than allowing any milquetoast tendencies to ever predominate. With the coming of sound, Arthur would perfect a nervous, whiny persona. He made his last screen appearance in 1951, the year of his death at the age of 68.Special kudos should be given to Walter James, Knute Erickson & George Austin for their strong support as a trio of very odd lunatics, all quite different & memorable.THE MONSTER is considered by many to be the first in a long line of Mad Doctor films. It is also a prime example of the Old Dark House genre of spook stories. It certainly has many of the elements: a crumbling edifice, a distressed young lady, escaped madmen, bony hands appearing from hidden panels, secret passageways and sudden death. The Old Dark House has for long years been a respected avenue in literature & movies to maximize suspense & tension. Indeed, it's only a short walk from the Edwards Sanitarium in this film to Wuthering Heights, Baskerville Hall, Manderley & the Bates House...", "Lightweight but enjoyable romp about a lunatic asylum taken over by its star inmate, played by Chaney.  This one is played entirely for laughs, but Chaney has to play it straight, in a pretty lame role for the great star. West brings some of his nice effects to bear, in the slick sequence where the milquetoast hero flies through a window on a telephone cord, slides down four stairwells and ends up knocking his assailant out cold!  I also especially enjoyed the scenes where the inmates lowered a huge mirror onto the road to divert traffic into a ditch -- it was like something come to life out of a scooby doo cartoon!  Great fun in the light gothic style.", "This is a bizarre little horror/comedy, mostly a comedy, the horror aspects almost parody. Lon Chaney has the top billing, but he's the evil adversary to a group of three, the leader being an amateur detective far too reminiscent of the previous year's Sherlock Jr. by the great Buster Keaton. He carries around a book called How to Be a Detective, and there are frequent zoom-ins which underline certain passages in the book. This is the ancestor to the type of film where a group of normal people are abducted into a strange house with a strange owner.As for the film's quality, its humor is generally on target, but it is never all that funny. A lot of giggles, but I never laughed out loud. It is often very slow moving, but it has a few wonderful set pieces and suspense scenes. Lon Chaney's villain is pretty entertaining; I really wish they would have had more of him. There's much more footage of his evil henchman. The climactic scene is excellent.", "Lon Chaney, (Dr. Ziska) plays the role of a mad scientist who takes over a sanitarium full of lunatics and removes all the professional staff and begins to use the mental patients as his helpers in getting him bodies for his experiments. Johnny Arthur, (Johnny Goodlittle) plays the role as a sissy or pansy and has a great attraction for Betty Watson,(Gertrude Olmstead) who also seems attracted to him also. Johnny Goodlittle is also studying to become a detective and to prove himself as a successful crime expert. There is plenty of creepy looking characters and secret panels all over dark looking homes. The great actor, Lon Chaney gave an outstanding performance in a very great silent film from 1925 and there was also plenty of laughs. Don't miss this great film classic. Enjoy", "The small town of Danburg is plagued by strange disappearances. In the opening minutes, we see a strange man trapping people while they drive on isolated streets. After reading the book \"How to Become a Detective\" and obtaining his \"diploma\" from a mail-order school for detectives, mild-mannered store clerk Johnny Arthur (as Johnny Goodlittle) decides to solve the missing person problem. His book advises Mr. Arthur use \"ingenuity\" to solve the crime. After losing his girlfriend at a dance, Arthur goes off to pout and haplessly finds himself abducted like the other missing people. He is brought to a sanatorium run by mad scientist Lon Chaney (as Gustave Ziska)...Arthur's girlfriend Gertrude Olmstead (as Betty Watson) and brawny rival Hallam Cooley (as Amos Rugg) also arrive at the old dark house, where Mr. Chaney is conducting bizarre experiments. It's odd to see Ms. Olmstead, a fairly popular co-star, introduced in close-ups that show her eyes misshapen and teeth in unflattering light. Fortunately, photographer Hal Mohr improves Olmstead's camera angles in subsequent scenes. Snarling lines like, \"Tighten his straps until he squeals!\" hammy Mr. Chaney wants to transfer a man's soul into a female body. Yes, \"The Monster\" could have helped inspire \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" (1975)...\"The Monster\" is often promoted and introduced as a horror film starring Lon Chaney. It's not. Think of it as a comedy film starring Johnny Arthur and you're less likely to be disappointed. Arthur is effective under Roland West's direction as they adapt Crane Wilbur's Broadway stage play. The main sets are sometimes stagy, but they're designed well and Mr. West varies blocking and camera positions. Supplementary sets and locations are commendable, especially an exciting sequence of \"high-wire\" stunts for Johnny. The ending is exciting, but it doesn't get wild enough. It would have been fun to see more of Chaney's experiments reach fruition.****** The Monster (3/16/25) Roland West ~ Johnny Arthur, Lon Chaney, Gertrude Olmstead, Hallam Cooley", "Johnny Goodlittle (Johnny Arthur) is an amateur detective and sets out to solve the disappearance of John Bowman. Meanwhile he also fights for the attention of Betty Watson (Gertrude Olmstead) from Hal (Hallam Coolley). They soon all end up in a very weird sanitarium run by Dr. Ziska (Lon Channey) who may not be what he seems to be...This has it all--three innocents stuck in a creepy sanitarium on a dark and stormy night; a mad doctor; clutching hands; secret passageways; monsters lurking about and lots of action and adventure. This is a very strange but fun horror comedy with the emphasis on comedy. Some of the comedy is stupid (Arthur getting drunk was tired and unfunny) but, for the most part, it works. The horror aspect here is minor and wouldn't even scare a young kid.The acting is all pretty good. As for Chaney he's obviously enjoying himself--it's one of his few roles when he doesn't have tons of makeup on. He also plays his character way way WAY over the top, but does so in an engaging way.Yes it's a silly movie but, after it gets to the sanitarium, in never stops moving and is lots of fun. It gets only an 8 because of the slow opening half hour and a terrible music score that doesn't even match the images on screen!", "A meek clerk (Johnny Arthur) who doubles as an amateur detective investigates some very strange goings-on at a remote mental sanitarium.Director Roland West did not make a great many films (he seems to have been more of a stage director), but he did do a few with Lon Chaney. This is one of those few.The movie probably is not well known, but it has the reputation of being one of the first \"mad scientist\" movies, and has the distinction of being an \"old dark house\" movie, actually beating \"The Old Dark House\" (1932) to the punch.And while the horror elements are here (the scientist and the monster), this also works great as a comedy. There are some funny intertitles with some racy humor (including a milkman joke), and the humorous bannister / storm gag is worthy of Buster Keaton.Lastly, a special shout-out to Gertrude Olmstead, one of the \"victims\" of the talkies. Olmstead had a strong career in the silent era and has an excellent presence, but she never made the transition to sound and is now almost completely forgotten. A shame.", "Lon Chaney is known as \"The Man of a Thousand Faces,\" and known for make-up magic and for playing monster parts, but too little is he recognized as a actor -- at least too little in my opinion.In \"The Monster,\" he is frequently understated and even almost charming, considering the part.Johnny Arthur, this time, is a star!This must be his best part and he too showed he is by gosh an actor.His character changes, with a little chemical help, but he comes across as believable in every characterization. His face, his gestures, his bodily movement are all just perfect.Turner Classic Movies showed \"The Monster\" as part of its Halloween line-up in 2016 and as its Sunday night silent on 30 October, although in the Eastern time zone I guess it was actually Monday, 31 October.It is a treat, at least once, with some funny situations and funny characters, and some generally excellent acting.There are some directing or at least editing problems, and you can't take the story too seriously, but mostly it is a lot of fun.", "A meek store clerk (and aspiring detective) investigating a man's disappearance winds up at a creepy old sanitarium with the girl he loves and his rival. They find the supposedly abandoned place is inhabited by weird Dr. Ziska (Lon Chaney) and his cronies. After the strong opening, I was really expecting this to be a great one. While it is good and I did like it, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. For starters, it's part horror-mystery and part comedy. The horror-mystery parts are good; a precursor to the many mad scientist and old dark house movies to come. But the comedy is pretty weak. The lead character appears to be a rip-off of Buster Keaton's Sherlock Jr, which was released a year prior. Still, the comedy is the minor part of the movie. Most of it is old dark house/mad scientist craziness with Lon Chaney. That's pretty cool, no matter how you slice it. Also love the sets, gadgets, and special effects.", "This 1925 silent film starring Lon Chaney and Johnny Arthur and directed by Roland West (\"The Bat\", \"The Bat Whispers\") is a harmless little horror-comedy about two men and a woman who get trapped in an old dark house with a mad scientist (the always excellent Chaney) and go through a series of perilous events caused by the scientist and his never ending supply of creepy servants. The acting is good and the production values are superb. Most of the comedy is funny and the creepy parts still hold up reasonably well. All in all, \"The Monster\" is no classic and certainly one of Lon Chaney's less remarkable films but it's still a decent, harmless film.", "I was rather disappointed by THE MONSTER this time around: it has little to offer apart from its very strangeness (which appears to be a trademark of director Roland West, who later made both the silent version of THE BAT [1926] and its first sound remake THE BAT WHISPERS [1930]).The plot is very creaky: typical 'old dark house' stuff - and not especially interesting at that - which frequently borders on the ludicrous. It starts off well enough with an atmospheric sequence set in a thunderstorm, and the comic relief which occupies most of the film's expository first half (possibly inspired by Buster Keaton's SHERLOCK JR., made the previous year) is likable enough. But when the three leading characters get caught inside a desolate sanitarium, taken over by mad scientist Chaney, the film starts to drag and it never quite recovers. Chaney is flanked by three distinctive-looking assistants/former patients: one, dressed in a cape throughout most of the proceedings, is suitably creepy; another, fairly amusing, is a buffoonish character whose child-like approach to things thwarts Chaney's plans more often than abetting them; and there is also the (rather grating) standard of all such flicks, the mute strong-man who never does anything more strenuous than scowling!Chaney himself is wasted here: the scientist, Dr. Ziska, is supposed to be working on some 'great experiment' but this is barely touched upon till the final reel - and by this time, the audience has stopped caring! Johnny Arthur, the film's unlikely hero, gets to do an incredible stunt (another nod to Keaton) and there are a few genuinely eerie scenes, like when a pair of hands reach out from under the sleeping heroine to grasp her. The film also betrays its stage origins by flat and stagy direction - the only other Roland West picture I have watched, THE BAT WHISPERS, is far more cinematically fluid and interesting (if still basically flawed).", "THE MONSTER (1925) is a fine little comedy horror film featuring the great Lon Chaney as deranged mad scientist Dr Ziska. I was surprised at just how entertaining this was given that I'd never heard of it before watching a decent print on Amazon Prime. The story has three characters getting waylaid by asylum inmates in the countryside before finding themselves trapped inside the sanatarium itself. An early entry in the 'old dark house' genre, it has all of the usual hijinks including ugly characters creeping around in the dark, mysterious disappearances, secret experiments and even a bit of action.The comedy angle is certainly played up throughout with the main character a Chaplin lookalike who fancies himself as an amateur detective and has a mail-order certificate to prove it! He's in love with a beautiful shopkeeper's daughter but must battle a love rival while fending off Chaney's sinister intentions to boot. No especial prosthetics for Chaney in this one, just a creepy makeup job, and he's excellent alongside his kooky comrades. A really enjoyable and funny little silent film that feels ahead of its time, this one.", "The best known name in this is, of course, Lon Chaney, who plays Dr. Ziska - a mad scientist who has taken over a sanitarium and is performing experiments on poor unfortunates. The bulk of the movie, though, is carried by an actor named Johnny Arthur. He seems to have had a relatively lengthy (if not especially well known) career, that made the crossover from silents to talkies. This is a silent movie, of course, and Arthur was fine as a wannabe detective who's out to solve the mystery of a wealthy farmer who mysteriously disappeared one night.\"The Monster\" tried perhaps a bit too hard to be a combination comedy/suspense thriller. Some, I guess, would call it a horror movie, but it never really came across that way to me. In fact, the comedy elements seemed to predominate for the most part. It's irreverent and even at times slapstick in its approach. It uses the pretty standard setting of what seems to be more of a large house than a sanitarium to create a mystery - and, while at times it is mysterious, it never really (to me at least) became frightening, nor did the humour become truly funny. It caused a smile every now and then, I suppose. My biggest criticism would be that it took far too long (really until about the last 10-15 minutes of the movie) for us to get a real sense of what it was that Dr. Ziska was up to, and waiting for that became at times rather tiresome, as likable as all the main characters were.Chaney, who received top billing although his role was secondary (and maybe even less than that) did make Ziska mysterious and in some respects even threatening. The other primary members of the cast were Gertrude Olmstead as Betty, the wannabe detective's love interest, and Hallam Cooley, as his rival for Betty's affection. This was OK. Nothing more than that. I wouldn't consider it a silent classic, although it isn't difficult to watch. (4/10)", "Lon Chaney is a good villain here. What is hard to figure out is his motivation. He seems to be having a good time kidnapping people whose cars are forced off the roads. But once he has them, what does he want to do. I guess they are to be experimented on with a \"soul transfer.\" Soon three young folks end up in his trap. About half the movie involves them trying to get out and each of them being treated in some silly way by Chaney, the mad doctor. There is quite a sensual scene as the young woman is strapped to a gurney as Chaney sort of drools over her. The two men are a couple idiots which make this a comedy, not to ever make us worry about the consequences of the mad doctor's actions. This is a pretty much a long, drawn out movie that could have really stood some editing.", "Monster, The (1925)** (out of 4)The teaming of legend Lon Chaney and director Roland West sadly ends up being a very disappointing entry in the \"old dark house\" genre, which was still quite new at the time this was released. In the film, Chaney plays a mad scientist trying to figure out the secrets of life in an abandoned asylum. Wannabe detective (Johnny Arthur) winds up at the asylum with the woman (Gertrude Olmstead) he loves and the two try to destroy the scientist and his evil ways. THE MONSTER is a major disappointment that doesn't appear to know what type of film it wants to be. Considering Chaney is given top-billing you'd think that the director and studio would want a horror film or at least some sort of dark mystery but they only partially give us that. For some reason the film contains a lot of comedy relief that really sinks everything. The film starts off with the wannabe detective, a store clerk in reality, constantly being pushed around and of course he plans to show them all one day. We get another guy thrown into the mix because he appears to be more \"manly\" and of course these two both want the same woman. This silly love story never comes full circle and it really just adds minutes to the running time and the film certainly didn't need that. There's full comedy scattered throughout the film and it's a bit of a mystery why they bothered. I mean, you do have the Man of a Thousand Faces and you do have him playing the role of a mad scientist so did they really think people wanted to see this type of comedy? Even stranger is that Chaney gets top-billing yet he doesn't appear until the mid-way point and sadly both Arthur and Olmstead aren't strong enough to carry the material. Once Chaney does get on screen he delivers another fine performance and while there's not any real make-up, I did enjoy that head full of white hair. Chaney was always good at playing mad and he does a good job here but it's a shame he's wasted. West's direction is pretty much all over the place and it's clear that he couldn't do comedy. The \"old dark house\" stuff is a tad bit better but it's still far from what he did with THE BAT.", "Timid JOHNNY ARTHUR carries the first half-hour of THE MONSTER as a detective wanna-be, a sort of silent screen version of the characters Woody Allen often played decades later. Based on a play by Crane Wilbur, the slow moving story takes time to even get to the sanitarium nearby where the mystery angle of the plot will be unraveled.Playing detective, Arthur accidentally stumbles into a house of horrors. Meantime, after a road accident, his girlfriend and his boss stumble into the same mansion seeking help. It is then that Dr. Ziska (LON CHANEY) makes his sinister appearance, informing them that they must stay in the house overnight since he has no telephone. He tells his hulking servant to make them comfortable.Chaney plays his role similar to Bela Lugosi's caped Dracula, so the chill effect is everything it ought to be in a dark house thriller played with mock fright. The comedy aspect of the story would have made a great vehicle for Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard (a la their CAT AND THE CANARY) dark house comedy.It seems the lunatics have taken over the asylum. The mad doctor Ziska has locked Dr. Edwards and his assistants in a dungeon below the mansion and has the patients carrying out his orders. Amateur detective Arthur saves the day by shooting off Roman candles that alert the townspeople to his help signal.It's all done in spirited good fun and confusion, played for laughs more than horror although there is a definite combination of mirth and fright.Summing up: Good dark house comedy with all the usual drawbacks of early silent films but more watchable than most. Not a typical Chaney film by any means. Much lighter than Roland West's THE BAT WHISPERS.", "The Monster (1925) is a Lon Chaney silent movie gem available on Tubi. The storyline follows a newly graduated private detective and his fianc\u00e9e who track down a local missing person case to an old asylum run by Dr. Ziska. While Dr. Ziska seems welcoming he has his own intentions for the investigator and his future bride.This movie is directed by Roland West (Alibi) and stars Lon Chaney (The Phantom of the Opera), Gertrude Olmstead (The Boob), Johnny Arthur (On Trial) and Hallam Cooley (Holiday).The storyline and settings of this picture are very entertaining. Cooley and Chaney are awesome and steal the show with their depiction of the ghouls and they are aided by fantastic background noises creating an addition level of intensity. Arthur looks the part and plays the naive detective perfectly and the conclusion is worthwhile and entertaining.Everything Lon Chaney is in is a must see and this is up there with his best work. I'd score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.", "***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE MONSTER (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1925), directed by Roland West, is a tongue and cheek melodrama with more comedy that chills. Leading the cast is Lon Chaney playing a crazed future horror great, Boris Karloff. Chaney, as usual, is sinister and creepy, but the movie in general belongs to Johnny Arthur.The story begins with this opening title: \"A human monster with cat-like eyes for a victim.\" This is followed by a wealthy farmer named John Bowman returning home, driving through a lonely country road late at night. He notices a car on his lane with headlights and soon overturns off the road. Moments later, two mysterious men creep up upon the unconscious Bowman and take him away. Later, in the town of Danburg, Johnny Goodlittle (Johnny Arthur), an under clerk working in a store managed by Amos Rugg, is studying on how to become a detective. He, along with Hal (Hallam Coolley), vie for the affection of Betty Watson (Gertrude Olmstead), the head clerk's (Edward McWade) daughter. Detective Jennings (Matthew Betz) arrives in Danburg to investigate the disappearance of Bowman, but tries to ignore Johnny, the \"amateur sleuth.\" After Johnny receives a package containing handcuffs and a diploma from the detective correspondence school, he decides to prove himself to Jennings, and especially to Betty, and go out to solve the mystery himself. After attending Betty's party, Johnny goes outside in the night, sits by a tree and is approached by an odd looking stranger who asks him for a match to light his cigarette. The stranger, obviously insane, suddenly disappears into the night. Moments later, with the sound of wind and thunder, another car approaches the country road where it overturns with more victims being taken away. Johnny witnesses this, follows them and suddenly falls through a trap door covered by leaves and leaps into the basement of a mysterious house, surrounded by hanging skeletons, which turns out to be a sanitarium. Johnny is then greeted by Doctor Ziska (Lon Chaney), a once a famous surgeon, and learns that this mad scientist is experimenting on surgeon, whose make-up in this production supplied with white hair makes this man of a thousand faces resemble quite remarkably that of bringing the dead back to life by killing his victims through electrocution and transferring the soul from one body to another.THE MONSTER is not as well known as Chaney's other 1925 releases, including \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (Universal) and \"The Unholy Three\" (MGM), but one can say that this could be called the \"granddaddy\" of the mad scientists genre. Chaney fans would somewhat be disappointed, however, to watch Johnny Arthur as the major character while Chaney's is secondary, making his first screen appearance 30 minutes into the movie. Chaney was obviously put into this production for box office assurance, but all in all, it does have its moments of thrills and chills supported by suspicious looking characters.In the supporting cast are Charles A. Sellon playing the constable; Walter James as Calliban, Ziska's creepy assistant; and Knute Erickson as Daffy Dan. Available for viewing on cable TV's Turner Classic Movies, it is accompanied by a same musical score originally written for this film and others for the PBS presentation of \"Movies, Great Movies\" (Original New York City air date: September 17, 1973), a 13-week tribute to MGM silent films of the twenties. Predating those other \"haunted house\" thrillers such as Universal's THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) and THE OLD DARK HOUSE (1932, with Boris Karloff), THE MONSTER is worth seeing once, even for curiosity sake. (**)", "This is a Lon Chaney film that has its moments, but frankly needed more of Lon Chaney. He plays a lunatic who in the opening scene causes a car crash by using a mirror, then captures the victim. It's a great start and the dark old house he inhabits with his minions is full of secret chutes and trap doors, giving the film a creepy atmosphere. Unfortunately, that's offset by the film spending too much time on Johnny Arthur's character and things like the junior detective stuff and him accidentally getting drunk. The film goes for comedy, romance (Gertrude Olmstead is the love interest), and horror, and would have been better off concentrating on horror, at least for my taste. When Chaney's on the screen the film is at its best, and it's worth seeing if you're a fan of his, otherwise, it may be a bit too creaky and slow.", "This is a very strange Lon Chaney film due to the plot as well as the focus of the film--which is generally not on Chaney but on a trio who get sucked into his maniacal world.The film begins with a silly plot device. A caped madman raises and lowers a giant mirror across the road to cause an accident. However, when the locals investigate, the doctor who was driving the car is missing! The film then focuses on a young wimpy man who wants to be a detective. He tries to get the people to listen to him and his theories about what actually happened, but no one listens---even though he's just completed a home-study course on how to be a detective! This is all pretty strange, I know.Later this guy plus a couple all get stranded out by the mental institution outside of town. Considering it's raining, they look for shelter or accidentally stumble into a trapdoor leading to the asylum in one case. Once inside, they wished they hadn't come it, as the place is a bizarre place--full of strange trap doors, hidden rooms and chambers and filled with characters that looked quite at home in a Frankenstein film! The doctor in charge of the asylum (Chaney) bids them welcome and offers to put them up for the night. But once steel doors spring over all the windows, they realize they are trapped and have no choice but to stay. And, naturally, it turns out that the doctor is NOT a doctor but a madman who has taken over the asylum. So, it's up to our daring detective to spring to action and save everyone and solve the mystery.This truly is one of the strangest silent films I've ever seen, but its strangeness and all the cool gadgets and overacting make this a fun film to watch--though not exactly cerebral or subtle! In many ways, it reminds me of the silent classic THE CAT AND THE CANARY--another scary old house film from the silent era. Plus, in the 1970s, the plot for THE MONSTER was reworked into the very cheesy and not worth watching schlock-film, THE MANSION OF MADNESS. THE CAT AND THE CANARY is worth seeing, MANSION OF MADNESS definitely isn't.", "This odd little silent film, \"The Monster,\" displays more ingenuity than some give it credit for. Basically, it's a horror comedy in the vein of \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927) and an early instance on the screen of the old dark house and mad doctor tropes. It's based on a play that I know nothing about, but it seems to reference a very-well-known play, indeed, in Shakespeare's \"The Tempest.\" This goes beyond there being a slave named \"Caliban\" in both. Additionally, there's a similarity to Buster Keaton's film \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924). The protagonist Johnny is a wannabe detective, like Keaton's projectionist, and carries around a how-to book on becoming one. Like Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, there's also the name \"Watson\" here for the stupid friends of Johnny, his love-interest Betty Watson, as well as the rest of her family, and his rival for her affections Amos, but who in the credits is listed as \"Watson's Head Clerk\" (both Amos and Johnny work in his shop, where Betty suggestively informs the relatively-effeminate Johnny that, \"I - - I just dropped in for some pansy seeds.\"). So, what ties all of this together? Use some Holmesian deduction, and one may recognize that \"The Tempest\" and \"Sherlock Jr.\" are two of the most stupendous self-reflexive works in their respective art forms, and this is where \"The Monster\" displays its ingenuity.Cinema is analogous to mirrors. Both capture images and reflect them back to us. This is where \"The Monster\" begins, with the crazed Rigo in a tree lowering a mirror onto a road. From his own reflection, a driver believes he's about to run into another car and so swerves and crashes. Amos and Betty do likewise later. There's an element of Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking Glass\" here, as the characters figuratively, if not literally, enter the mirror. Meanwhile, Johnny falls through the rabbit hole, so to speak of Carroll's prior Alice novel, and ends up in the same place as the others, the Old Dark House. A mirror is also employed to read evidence--the backwards-written message of \"help.\" As with a mirror, as with Carroll, things are reversed in the house, too, which is actually a sanitarium where the inmates are running the asylum and where a sleepy little town receives some excitement. It's also a world where Johnny's budding detective skills, previously mocked by the townsfolk, are valued and where his chances with the girl, attached to Amos before entering the mirror, are also reversed. To complete the reversing, the mad doctor (played by Lon Chaney in a self-parody of his usual grotesque parts) plans to reverse genders by transferring the soul of a man into a woman. A minor plot point here, this is what another underrated horror film regarding a mad doctor, \"Frankenstein Created Woman\" (1967), the best of Hammer's Frankenstein series, is mainly about.As the characters enter the mirrored haunted house, there's the tempest outside in the storm. Inside, Chaney's mad doctor is like Prospero, manipulating and tricking the marooned travelers and ordering Caliban to do his bidding. Albeit, this Prospero's plan for the uniting of lovers is considerably more strange. Interesting is the use of the Old Dark House formula, which would later gets its moniker from the 1932 James Whale production and become a popular horror film subgenre thanks to the likes of the director here, Roland West, who also made \"The Bat\" (1926) and its talkie remake \"The Bat Whispers\" (1930). It's not cinematically specific as, indeed, this one is based on a play, but the self-reflexive emphasis on effects in the story and in the production of it, as with \"The Tempest,\" holds up in this new location, full of shadows, concealed peepholes, secret passages, trap doors, lightning and storm effects and even some tightrope walking. The effects of \"Sherlock Jr.\" were more specific to film, as Keaton entered the movie screen, encountering the quintessential element of film: montage.Additionally, the pacing is a bit slow to start and over-filled with jokey intertitles. Too much time is spent on establishing characters and a town that will hardly figure in most of the movie. The mirror business here is cleverly self-reflexive, though, and if nothing else, \"The Monster\" draws from some incredible sources in Carroll, Doyle, Keaton and Shakespeare. I wonder how much of this was in the stage version and whether the detective story was added in adaptation.", "WE HAVE LONG heard of this film; but only viewed it for the very first time yesterday. Owing that fact to the modern marvel & technological miracle known as the DVR, Turner Classic Movies' telecast of this Silent Feature of a week or so ago is right at our finger tips. (Clever, these Americans!)THE MOVIE WAS the subject of one author/reviewer's writing in some book we'd had thirty or so years back. We do recall a few of his remarks today and quite clearly at that.FIRST OF ALL, this now unknown scribe had said that the film was that it was a real puzzlement to the movie going audience of the nineteen twenty five season. The film's dark and spooky mood is quickly off set by comical situations and Title Cards that were befitting productions of Mack Sennett or Hal Roach.SECONDLY THERE WAS an assertion that what the movie actually was successful in parodying the Monster/Mad Scientist genre of Horror film; but before there was such an established classification. This does, on the surface, appear to be an incredible analysis; but one that has reasonable amount of merit.WITH REGARD TO these two notions, we heartily concur. Now that we have at last seen the Lon Chaney vehicle. In this one, the 'monster' is really the evil scientist, Dr. Ziska (Mr.Chaney). In this role, he demonstrates a little realized and appreciated for the comic situations.*HIS SUBDUED CHARACTERIZATION of the elegant yet totally sinister 'host' of the sanitarium must have set the standards and was the model for so many others yet to come in similar roles. One can readily see smatterings of this characterization in performances by Otto Krueger in SABATEUR (Universal,1940) and MURDER, MY SWEET (RKO, 1944); as well as many others.THE SCRIPT DOES seem to purposely make us Midwest Rubes the brunt of so much of the jokes. With its many references to locations in Kansas, Indiana and Illinois, it appears to support the notion that \"Big City\" folks are superior.AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT of the plot line concerns the General Store Clerk (Johnny Arthur) and both his wanting of fair maiden Betty Watson (Gertrude Olmsted) while at the same time desiring to become a Private Eye.ALTHOUGH IT IS Lon Chaney who gets the starring role & billing, Johnny Arthur's role is the real main character of the story.AND SPEAKING OF the diminutive actor, we remember him as portraying Spanky McFarland's father in an OUR GANG Sound Short, as the bad Imperial Japanese Officer in some Hal Roach Wartime short and as the head of the Axis 5th Column Operative Mura Sakima in the MASKED MARVEL Serial (Republic, 1944).", "John Bowman is taken by human monsters on the road. The insurance company is offering $5000 reward for information on his whereabouts. Amateur detective Johnny Goodlittle is eager to solve the case but many others are already at the crime scene. He's in love with Betty Watson but she has another suitor, Amos Rugg. Following a clue pointing to a nearby closed sanitorium which everybody else dismissed, he finds the trap on the road and the mad scientist Dr. Ziska (Lon Chaney).This is a nice silent era mad scientist horror. It's not necessarily scary but it has good atmosphere and solid humor. The lead is a bumbling hero and he maintains a good contrast with the more fitting hero. He has good comedy. I don't think that this is well remembered. It's definitely not as well known as one of the main Universal monsters. Nevertheless, this lays out the grounds for a familiar character type. It's a fun horror even if it's not the most tense.", "The Monster is one of the great Lon Chaney's less memorable ventures. It's neither bad nor good, though it does have its moments. The only reason it doesn't get a lower rating is because it doesn't take itself too seriously and Chaney is somewhat entertaining as a mad scientist.The story involves three young adults (Johnny Arthur, Gertrude Olmstead, Hallam Cooley) trapped in a creepy asylum under the \"hospitality\" of a mad doctor (Lon Chaney) whose intentions seem quite malicious. Arthur's character is a less funny version of Buster Keaton's character in Sherlock Jr., but he's not bad and certainly the most memorable of the trio. Chaney is entertaining as the mad doctor, but it is far from being one of his better parts. The \"haunted house\" plot feels very dated and some of the jokes really aren't all too funny.Though mostly forgettable, The Monster is essential for huge Chaney fans like myself and if you're really bored, then you might like to waste some time with this one."], "tt0016220": ["THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (Universal, 1925), directed by Rupert Julian, from the celebrated novel by Gaston Leroux, stars Lon Chaney, the legendary \"man of a thousand faces,\" in what is hailed to be his most famous movie role, as well as one of the most bizarre presentations of his thousand faces ever shown on screen.Hailed as a horror movie, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is actually a mystery tale with added suspense that takes place in a Paris opera house believed to be haunted by a mysterious cloaked figure obsessed by one particular girl, Christine Daae (Mary Philbin), an understudy, whose main interest is her love for Raoul De Chagny (Norman Kerry), her fianc\u00e9. Christine keeps hearing a compelling voice behind the walls of her dressing room that gives her encouragement to perform. Her career soon takes a turn for the better when the lead performer is \"mysteriously\" unable to go on and Christine is called to take her place. The voice later summons Christine to the cellar five flights beyond the opera house where she follows this sinister man whose face is covered with a mask. Although she fears him not, Christine becomes very curious about \"The Phantom,\" but curiosity gets the better of her when she decides to creep up from behind the phantom and remove his mask, only to get the surprise of her life. The Phantom agrees to release Christine from his underground cellar (consisting of a coffin bed where the Phantom sleeps) at a promise that she not only devote herself to her opera singing, but to never see or speak to her fianc\u00e9 again. Only after Christine has a secret meeting with Raoul during a ball masque does the Phantom, who shadowed her, to make Christine his prisoner of love.In true Universal fashion, this Gothic presentation has all the elements of a suspense thriller. From its opening shot shows a cloaked figure creeping about the underground cellar of the opera house. The storyline immediately gets down to basics in which there's a discussion amongst the staff regarding a mysterious figure roaming about, followed by the sudden appearance of another mysterious character (Arthur Edmund Carewe) walking about the opera house, saying nothing but observing everything. In between these key scenes leading to the purpose of the movie title, there are ballet and opera sequences inter-cutting the plot, along with a stage hand (Snitz Edwards) supplying some \"comic relief.\". This being a silent film, the compositions from FAUST cannot be heard, but are usually heard through the underscoring which accompanies the film. Besides the now familiar story and its just famous unmasking sequence, it's Chaney as Erik, the mysterious phantom, with his skull-like appearance, who makes this one of the most intense characters ever played on the screen. The movie, itself, fails to explore the background to Erik's character, as to why does he choose Christine as his selected one. Only late into the story is it realized, through the investigation in the police records by Christine's fianc\u00e9, Raoul, that Erik is not only a self-educated musician having escaped imprisonment from Devil's Island, but is actually insane. Other than being insane, he's a genius, for that he has decorated his underground chambers with certain traps, including a room that can fill with water or become filled with intense heat for his intruders. While Erik being insane might explain certain aspects as his intent to kill certain individuals at the opera house (with one scene finding one man left dangling from a noose), but fails to answer the question, \"Was Erik born this way or was he a rejected creation of Doctor Frankenstein?\"So popular upon its release, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was reissued in 1930, a shorter print with added talking sequences and new orchestral score. Universal remade THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA in 1943 with Claude Rains; and in 1962 with Herbert Lom, each performed differently from the Chaney carnation, but with some explained detail to the Phantom's background of character.THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has achieved cult status over the years, due to constant revivals, ranging from theaters to television. It was one of the selected twelve movies shown on public television's 1975 presentation of \"The Silent Years\", hosted by Lillian Gish. During the era of home video in the 1980s, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA not only became a public domain title, but consisted of various versions and different scores. The Kartes Video Communications print features no scoring but a different opening introducing Raoul de Chagny (Kerry) and his brother, Philippe (John St. Polis), through title cards, and other scenes detailing the character of Carlotta (Virginia Pearson). There's even a conclusion with Christine and Raoul kissing on their honeymoon in Viroflay, a fade-out that's non-existent in most prints. BLACKHAWK Video, later Republic Home Video, included an excellent organ score (by Gaylord Carter) and clear picture quality of 79 minutes, the standard length of many video copies, but excluding the brief honeymoon closing. This similar print can be found from KINO Video.In one of the Turner Classic Movies cable TV presentations of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights a few years ago, the station, having broadcast with a traditional organ score in years past, presented Halloween night one of the worst reproductions and bad orchestrations ever presented for a silent movie, making this 97 minute version appear endless. Eventually TCM went ahead and a more soothing copy and organ score afterwards.As it stands, THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA can be seen numerous ways on video and DVD (at either 97 minutes or longer with orchestral scoring), but it's Lon Chaney's cloak figure that will remain in lasting memory long after the movie is over. (***)", "One of the most eminent horror films ever made and perhaps even the most famous silent horror movie from that time. Lon Chaney starred in over 150 films (most of them silent ones) but he'll always be remembered best for his personification of Erik, the Phantom. And justified! Even though this role was played by many respectable actors afterwards (like Claude Rains, Herbert Lom and Robert Englund) Lon Chaney is \u0096 and remains \u0096 the one and only Phantom of the Opera. The film itself is depressing and dark, with terrific photography and settings. Deep down the catacombs of the Parisian Opera building, the phantom reigns in forgotten dungeons and underground lakes. After all these years of dwelling in the opera, he has fallen in love with the unsuccessful singer, Christine. He helps her career a little and threatens to kill the prominent singer Carlotta if she doesn't hand over the her role in Faust to Christine. The until then unknown singer is thankful and meets her `master' in the catacombs. Her appreciation soon turns into fear when she finds out her benefactor is the horribly scarred Phantom of the Opera. The biggest difference between this first version and the later remakes lies in the roots of the Phantom. Here, Erik is said to be an escaped madman whereas he merely only was a hurt romanticist in later versions. His deformed appearance isn't explained and neither is shown how he falls for the beautiful, shy Christine.At least 3 sequences in the 1925 Phantom of the Opera are legendary and still astonishing after almost 80 years. The masked bal, which the Phantoms attends as the `Red Death' is an outstanding horror sequence and truly atmospheric. The grimaces of Chaney seem to look right through the other partygoers and his search for Christine is relentless. Immediately after this scene, the crew moves to the roof of the Opera building and Chaney takes place on top of the Apollo statue. A breathtaking piece of early cinema that stands the test of time like no other. The climax of Phantom of the Opera is an extended series of chasings and battues, resulting in the dramatic (and gruesome) death of our protagonist. Rupert Julian's classic silent has got everything! An actor capable of carrying the toughest role ever written, beautiful scenery, real-life drama, sentiment and romance. And last but not least an unbearable tension\u0085 Throughout the entire film, you're looking at it with your eyes wide open.", "Chaney is best known today for two roles: Quasimodo in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" and Erik in \"The Phantom of the Opera.\" The pair contrast the human response to physical deformity. While Quasimodo searches for kindness and acts to protect his home and loved ones, Erik shuns humanity and in his hatred and isolation becomes truly evil.Christine Daae (Mary Philbin) is the understudy at the Paris Opera house, an ancient structure built over a network of torture chambers and interconnecting cellars. Rumors abound of a ghost or phantom who stalks the halls, and even rents his own box for the performances. With the help of this mysterious stranger, Daae becomes the lead diva.Daae, apparently fine with her benefactor's use of extortion and mass murder to help her career, dumps her boyfriend Raoul (Norman Kerry) and follows the masked Phantom into the bowels of the opera house. She is, however, sensitive enough to collapse in a faint at the discovery that her benefactor is the legendary Phantom, and at his profession of love for her.Awakening, she discovers herself in a lavish bedroom he has prepared for her, with her name engraved on a hand mirror. But upon snatching off the Phantom's mask, she realizes that he isn't Prince Charming after all, but hideously deformed, with a skull-like face.The Phantom returns her to the opera, telling her that she must never see Raoul again. Upon reflection, however, Christine decides that looks and sanity are more important to her in a lover than she originally thought, and makes plans to meet Raoul at the annual masked ball. Raoul, neither particularly brave or smart, suggests that the two of them hightail it out of town. Christine, not one to run before her chance at the big time, suggests that they flee after the following evening's performance. Erik, of course, is listening in.At that point Erik drops his nice-guy facade, hangs a stagehand who discovers his trap door, kidnaps Christine and flees into the cellars. He is hotly pursued by Raoul and a Secret Police inspector, who are followed by Raoul's brother, who is followed by angry mob led by the murdered stagehand's brother.Erik, meanwhile, is trying to convince Christine of his capacity to reform (\"No longer like a toad in these foul cellars will I secrete the venom of hatred -- for you shall bring me love!\"). Alas, his plans to become a good husband are interrupted by the need to bump off a few of his pursuers, using elaborate boody traps and alarms throughout the dungeons.The final minute of the movie is perhaps the best, with Erik's final gesture proving that his mental ability far outweighs that of anyone else in the film. He goes out in style, leaving the dim-witted Raoul and his amoral girlfriend to live happily ever after.The two best things are Chaney's over-the-top performance as Erik and the spectacular sets. Chaney had a way of making any other actors in a film appear flat and lifeless, and this is no exception. The elaborate set of the opera house and the gothic appearance of the dungeons are still impressive, and the tinting and two-strip technicolor in the Bal Masque sequence look great.\"Phantom\" is rousing horror/adventure, while \"Hunchback\" was a touching allegorical film. The latter is better and more serious, but \"Phantom\" is still some of the most fun it's possible to have before a movie screen.", "Lon Chaney was the first of the long line of Phantoms and the one against whom all his successors had to be measuredThe story, despite all its alternatives, is the familiar one of the musician avoiding the world because of his disfigurement and retreating to a hideout beneath the Opera House, from where he emerges to terrorize singers and audience alikeHe kidnaps a young girl singer \u0096 perhaps to teach her to become a great star; certainly because, in his grotesque and pathetic way, he loves her \u0096 and carries her off to a boudoir he has prepared far undergroundThere was melodrama in plenty: in the first version, for example, two would-be rescuers found themselves trapped in an uncomfortable mirrored room the Phantom had prepared, where they first got a heat treatment and then were floodedBut, beyond all the heightened effects, it was the pathos of the Phantom underscoring his lonely menace which gave the character a dimension, and the isolation of the captor and his captive, imprisoned to a literal underworld, which gave the suspense of the whole film its power", "My goodness...close to fifty years ago I saw this film in the company of its leading lady, Mary Philbin.  She was a friend of an unforgettable lady our family had met when we moved from New England to southern California.  Our mutual friend was constantly prodding Miss Philbin, who had become quite reclusive after retiring from the screen, to get out and enjoy life.  (They took a trip to Europe one summer, for instance.)  One evening she persuaded Mary, who was extremely reluctant, by the way, to accompany us to the silent movie theater on Fairfax Ave., not far from Hollywood Blvd. and the site of Grauman's Chinese Theater and other first-run movie palaces, to see a revival of \"The Phantom of the Opera.\"  That old theater, not in the least luxurious and quite small, was a virtual shrine for lovers of silent films. Management had obtained a print of this film in acceptable condition, though I don't recall that the Technicolor sequence had been preserved in that print and, on that evening anyway, there was no musical accompaniment.Mary dreaded the experience of seeing one of her old films amid a mid-Fifties audience, which she feared would find the film a subject of comical curiosity rather than a piece of genuinely enthralling entertainment.  We joined the rest of the audience that night in enjoying the experience of seeing the film, however, and Mary was relieved that she had consented to accompany us (though she insisted that we shield her from any possible recognition, not too easy to do, since she had hardly changed in appearance in the quarter-century since that classic's production.)  I, for one, remember being amazed at the care and expense that had obviously been lavished on its production.Not very long after that evening, we went to a neighborhood theater in Pacific Palisades, Calif., to see James Cagney in the 1957 Universal-International biographical film about Lon Chaney, Sr., \"Man of a Thousand Faces,\" again with Mary Philbin in our company.  The unmasking scene from \"The Phantom of the Opera\" was rather perfunctorily recreated, with an actress playing Mary who did not resemble her.  As we exited the theater, Mary and our family friend, who had quite a few early Hollywood associations (She had once been married to Ernst Lubitsch, the legendary director, when they first came to Hollywood from their native Germany.), regaled me with reminiscences about Irving Thalberg (played in the film by a young Robert Evans), whom they had both known and for whom they had quite a high regard.Mary remained a family friend over the years until her death more than thirty years later.  She led a very quiet life, for many years occupying a house she had owned since the days of her stardom (only a few blocks north on Fairfax Ave. from that silent movie revival house!)  I remember her with great fondness for her modesty and extraordinary sweetness.", "My first exposure to the story, \"Phantom of the Opera\", was the current 2005 film version, featuring beautiful costumes, perfect filming, and on DVD a superb surround sound track. I like it, I own it, I watch it again from time to time.But this 1925 silent version with Lon Chaney as Eric, the Phantom, is actually a much better film to tell the story. Sure, it is silent, so we have to interpret facial expressions and body language, plus read occasional subtitles. But during the climax when Christine is down in the catacombs and comes face to face with Eric the first time, and sees his disfigured face. And when Raol is in the dark, wet, complex tunnels looking for her, these are much more dangerous looking scenes than in the modern movie.For all practical purposes the story is the same. Eric is the disfigured but insane genius who tries to force Christine to love him. As has been widely reported, Chaney did his own makeup and succeeded in making his character look almost skull-like. In all a fine older movie. Saw it on TCM channel.", "The current copy of the Universal production of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925) is only a shadow of what was once a great film.Originally, the way the film was shot, it stayed quite close to the book. Many people have complaints about the film straying from the novel, but key sequences like the Graveyard at Perros and the alternate ending where Erik dies of Christine's kiss were shot, then scrapped, then reshot, and then re-scrapped. Eventually, they were just rewritten or disacknowledged altogether.The original cut was shown in Los Angeles on January 7 and 26, 1925. This was the cut that used the most footage from what was shot starting on October-December 1924. Due to poor reviews, the January release was pulled, and Rupert Julian was told to reshoot most of the picture. Already having become a difficult director and egocentric over the fact that he was the star director ever since he replaced Erich Von Stroheim on THE MERRY-GO-ROUND (1924), he walked out on the studio.Edward Sedgewick (later director of Keaton's THE CAMERAMAN), who was working for Universal at the time, was asked by Carl Laemmele to reshoot and redirect a bulk of the movie. Raymond L. Schrock, who along with Elliot Clawson, was the screenwriter for the film, re-wrote new scenes to add into the film by the request of Sedgewick. Most of these scenes were added subplots, with Chester Conklin and Vola Vale as comedic partners to the heroes and Ward Crane as the Russian, \"Count Ruboff\" dueling for Christine's affection. This cut premiered in San Fransico on April 26, 1925 and also failed miserably with reviews.The final cut had to be made, so Maurice Pivar and Lois Weber re-wrote the final draft script, which was edited to the final nine reels, which debuted on September 6, 1925 at the Astor Theater in New York City, and October 17, 1925 in Hollywood. This cut only exists in 16mm Show-At-Home prints made by Universal for home movie use. These prints are not top quality, but watchable, and even the most complete existing version of this print today is incomplete from years of splicing. These 16mm prints sometimes make it to the underground video market and are best to watch for story, but not for quality.If you think about all of the mishandling in between, you realize how much has been tampered with the film so far. To add insult to injury, most prints circulating today, including Kino's and the Kevin Brownlow restoration, are actually from a re-release in 1929. When sound came around, Universal immediately redubbed Phantom in sound and re-shot about 40% of the film (whatever Lon Chaney was not in, since he was unavailable). The only quality 35mm print today is a copy made in 1950 for Eastman House in Rochester, NY of the silent cut of the sound re-release to distribute to theaters that didn't have sound systems.So as you can see, it is really almost impossible to truly critique THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1925). It is a semi-lost film.", "The titled character is a badly disfigured man (Lon Chaney) who stays in the catacombs of the Paris Opera House. He falls in love with the theater's newest leading lady (Mary Philbin) and hatches a plan to take her down to his tomb. Masked, able to play lovely music and say such lovely things, she finds herself strangely attracted to Chaney. However, she makes the mistake of unmasking him and that is when he shows his true deviant colors. \"The Phantom of the Opera\" is one of the finest pictures of the late silent era and Chaney was arguably the greatest performer of the period (of course Buster Keaton and Charles Chaplin fans would not agree). His ability to literally transform himself into movie monsters is truly uncanny, especially considering the lack of technical resources in the 1920s. New Zealand director Rupert Julian (who took sole credit in spite of the fact that Chaney and fellow director Edward Sedgwick also did some of the work behind the camera) uses tone to stretch his audience to their outer-limits throughout. Spooky, dramatic, stressful and memorable, \"The Phantom of the Opera\" is one of those silent pictures that will suck you in and never let you go. 5 stars out of 5.", "I find silent films more eerie than the talking B&W horror films (Dracula, Frankenstien, the Thing from Another World) and also more eerie than the modern color films (Suspiria, Ju-on, the Descent). The exaggeration in the actors gestures and expressions; the early camera technology that's not quite fluid and not quite clear; the tinted colors; and an artificially overlaid soundtrack \u0096 it all combines and adds up to paint an abstract and unnatural picture.Cinema has evolved so far since the Silent Era that watching these films is almost like glimpsing into another world completely unrelated to the one most of us grew up watching. And I find it fascinating that this is, indeed, the ancestor to many horror films that I adore today. So, like with other classics, I viewed Phantom of the Opera with the delight of discovering our cinematic horror roots \u0096 seeing the predecessor to Jack Pierce, Rick Baker, and Stan Winston in action, watching the precursor to John Carpenter, Mario Bava, and David Cronenberg.From the opening scene, Phantom of the Opera makes great use of shadows. A character with a lantern wanders the labyrinth below the Paris Opera house, ducking into an alcove as the shadow of the Phantom passes. Barring a handful of shots showing a cloaked figure from behind (or from a distance), this motif continues as Erik, the Phantom, is represented as a shadow, calling to Christine from the catacombs behind her dressing room mirror until she inevitably comes face to face with the mask (which she will inevitably remove.) Even though I'm quite familiar with the face of Lon Chaney's Phantom from the numerous still-shots out there, I still felt the pulse of anxiety and suspense when that famous moment drew near. Though blatantly exploitive in its camera angle, the timing, the expression on Chaney's face, though it aims purely for spectacle and shock for the audience of 1925, it carries something newer spectacles/shock-films lack: charm.I couldn't help but smile watching Chaney's haunting performance beneath that famous makeup, seeing it animated for the first time, the sadness and tragedy that underlines the phantoms soul. He moves with a precision and deliberateness that's not entirely natural, but remains paradoxically sincere. The rooftop scene, in particular, where Christine and Raoul plot, oblivious to the presence of the unmasked phantom who listens in with great intensity from his perch above \u0096 gripping his cape in his heartbroken state, eventually throwing himself back into the grasp of the statue in disbelieving defeat.There's something both awkward and poetic to the movements of the actors as they express their emotions not in subtleties, but rather in exaggerated body language that almost feels at home here (almost, but not quite.) Early in the film, frightened ballerinas spontaneously spin in place (one revolution) as a visual representation of their anxiety. Somewhat silly, but simultaneously delightful in its approach.Later in the film, Christine rejects the Phantom, arcing her back to its limit, her face turned as far away as possible, with her hands outstretched as if the very air around Erik would prove toxic. A single still frame presented to an audience, completely isolated from the context of the rest of the film, would leave absolutely no room for misinterpretations.The film goes on to a larger scope and bigger thrills with the inevitable fall of the chandelier, the Phantom's many tricks and traps in the catacombs under the Paris Opera House, and the final pursuit where the mob chases Erik through the streets of Paris -- the film strains itself to outdo all the silent films that came before. However, it strains too far, and I find myself liking the film in its quieter, more personal, exploits (the phantom in the shadows, the unmasking, the rooftop.) I do have to comment on the end of the film, though: Erik has been cornered and surrounded on all sides by the angry mob. He raises up a closed fist threateningly, as though within his grasp lay one final card that could level the playing field -- an explosive of some type -- and the crowd visibly hesitates, backing off. After a dramatic pause, the Phantom opens his hand to reveal he's holding nothing at all.Then we realize the film, itself, has done the very same thing. For the length of its running time it convinces you it held something -- some kind of awe-inspiring trick up its sleeve. Thus the problem with all exploitation films, but you have to admire Phantom for how it sustains so little for so long and makes you smile after you realize the truth.Like a good magic trick.", "This 1925 silent classic is still impressive, even after seventy-nine years!Lon Chaney's performance is easily the highlight of the movie. His ghostly movements about his underground lair are haunting even by today's standards.Use all of the computer generated images you want, but there is no substitute for authentic, old-world macabre. The scene where Erik's face is revealed is still shocking. He seems as horrorified by Christine seeing his face as she is by seeing his face. He seems to feel genuinely violated by her taking his mask off, revealing his horrible visage to the last person on earth he would want to see it. The Technicolor scene of the \"Bal Masque\" is also quite famous. The backdrops are very effective in creating the moody, medieval atmosphere of the underground passages. All in all, an excellent version of a timeless story.", "\"The Phantom of the Opera\" is a tale that's been oft told, but all too often it's told poorly. The story--a grand melodrama, like much of opera itself--requires a fine balance of terror and tragedy, with perhaps a bit of camp humor to lighten the proceedings, and finding the right tone is a task which has defeated many a director and actor. But it can be done, as this first of the many film incarnations proves.For anyone needing an overview of Gaston Leroux's tale, the premise is briefly thus: during the latter decades of the Victorian Era, the great Paris Opera is troubled with whispers of a ghost--a frightening specter which visits misfortune on the company should they fail to please him. Up-and-coming singer Christine Daae (Mary Philbin), meanwhile, is more preoccupied with her singing tutor--a disembodied voice she believes to be an emissary from her dead father, who guides her to new heights but demands she put her music above all else, including and especially her handsome childhood sweetheart Raoul (Norman Kerry). Neither Phantom nor tutor is a spirit in truth, but are two different sides of the same man--a horribly disfigured, unnaturally gifted, and frighteningly passionate man, but a man nonetheless.Despite dated acting techniques and some extremely overwrought title cards (\"You must save me, Raoul--oh, save me!\" Christine pleads at one point), the silent film version of \"Phantom\" has held up remarkably well, thanks to some evocative scenes and an unforgettable turn by Lon Chaney in the title role. The moment when the Phantom, driven by his all-consuming desire for Christine, lures the girl into his home beneath the Opera is every bit as eerie and compelling as it should be. An Escher-like series of ramps descends into the earth, leading to the sort of black subterranean lake Charon would feel at home on, and an underground apartment that seems fairly normal, until you see the coffin in the master bedroom and the mirrored torture chamber adjoining.Any version of \"Phantom,\" though, lives or dies by its title character, and Chaney does not disappoint. Even in his early scenes, where he appears almost solely as a shadow on the wall, he has a remarkable presence, his gestures expressive and elegant in silhouette. The audience first sees him in physical form as Christine first sees him--a masked and cloaked figure, disturbing yet with an aura of weary sadness about him. When that mask finally comes off in the film's landmark scene, Chaney's makeup genius is instantly in evidence. The wild-eyed, cadaverous skull remains the most frightening interpretations of the Phantom's disfigurement, and also the one which hews closest to Leroux's description. (To be fair, it's doubtful Chaney's makeup would have been practical in a sound film; the distortions of his nose and mouth would have made speaking--and singing--very difficult indeed.) The movie's greatest weakness is its ending, a chase scene (complete with the standard Angry Torch-Bearing Mob) that feels wedged in, probably because that's precisely what it is. The original ending stuck with Leroux's novel, where the Phantom, moved by Christine's compassion, releases her to marry her young suitor--but the first audiences, apparently not as empathetic for the character as his creator was, found this ending an unsatisfying one. Unfortunately, the current resolution denies the Phantom the redemption which has been a major part of his appeal to modern audiences, and one wishes that we had an opportunity to see Chaney portray it. But on the whole, this is a \"Phantom\" that remains head and shoulders above its many film successors.", "Those unaccustomed to the vagaries of cinema during its infancy may struggle with The Phantom Of The Opera's overtly theatrical acting, which in this case seems to be even more exaggerated than your average silent movie (I know I struggled at times with the actors' extravagant body movements and OTT facial expressions, some of which border on the ridiculous); however, no matter how cringe-worthy these exaggerated melodramatic performances might be at times, Rupert Julian's 1925 version of The Phantom of the Opera is still a worthwhile effort thanks to loads of breathtaking visuals, a memorable performance from Lon Chaney as 'phantom' Erik, and in the version I saw (the 1929 re-issue, I believe), a rousing orchestral score that perfectly complements the imagery.Blessed with excellent production values, superb set design and bold lighting, Phantom is a delight to behold, a visual feast that compensates for its cast's often laughable histrionics with several truly iconic moments: beautiful opera star Christina snatches the mask from ghoulish 'phantom' Erik as he plays the organ, revealing his hideously disfigured face; perched high atop a Gothic statue, cape billowing wildly in the wind, Erik watches in silent rage as Christina plans to run away with her lover; his face hidden by a grinning skull mask, Erik pursues Christina through the crowds at a masquerade ball; like Charon ferrying the dead across the river Styx, 'the phantom' guides his boat silently across an underground lake, Christina the unwilling passenger.", "Christine Daae is the understudy for Carlotta in the opera Faust at the grand opera house in Paris.  She receives coaching from a mysterious man that she can only hear but not see in her dressing room.  Meanwhile stories of a phantom go around the opera house and threatening notes are received that force Carlotta to call off sick, giving Christine her chance to shine, and shine she does.  However when she meets the man, he is the phantom \u0096 horribly scarred and insane.  He demands her love, but Christine plans to flee with her real lover \u0096 a plan that the phantom cannot allow.I'm not sure it if makes any great difference, but the version I watched was a restored version of this film with a new score and some colour treatment on the film stock.  The main thing that struck me about the film was the sheer grandeur and scale of the film.  The story is simply told but doesn't lose the tragic elements even if they are silently told.  The cast are to be praised for the job they do telling the story without words \u0096 it is a very different style of acting from today, but they do it well.  Each actor has to exaggerate their expressions and movements but not do so to the point of being comical, they all do well.  Philbin is excellent as the woman with an unwanted admirer and Chaney is a great phantom \u0096 tragic and hideous throughout.The film benefits greatly from a superb series of sets, each large, gothic and foreboding.  These wonderful sets are made even better by the cinematography which makes excellent use of shadow and light, the film has a great atmosphere to it and this is almost entirely created by the lighting and sets.  The film has had a helping hand in the restored version, the phantom's appearance as the Red Death is colour treated to give him a blood red cape which stands out in scenes of full colour or, as on the roof, where his cape is the only colour.  Even without this help the direction is great and the film feels rich in darkness to suit the material.The score is really great (in the version I saw) and is well designed to help the mood onscreen and compliment the emotions of the characters at any given moment.  I'm a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of action movies and multiplexes and am supposed to need things exploding to hold my attention, however this film hooked me throughout with it's tragic tale and lavish design.", "The 1925 Phantom of the Opera, widely regarded as the best film adaptation of the story ever, starts off with the explanation that the Paris Opera House rises nobly over torture chambers and hidden dungeons, which is a great way to start a story about a disfigured man living in the torture chambers and hidden dungeons under the Paris Opera House. It not only establishes the setting as a classy playhouse built on the ruins of past torture chambers and dungeons, but also provides a level of creepiness necessary in a movie in which Erik (the Phantom) is able to live down there, in vast recesses which have become unknown.Lon Chaney delivers a stunning performance, one of the most famous in film history. Indeed, the scene where Christine pulls off the Phantom's mask is still scary 80 years after its release. People in 1925 must have been nearly frightened out of their seats. This film is indeed the Exorcist of the 1920s. The very simple story is presented with stunning effectiveness, especially since the now very recognizable music is not even in this version.In the cellars under the Paris Opera House lives the Phantom, who demands of the new and understandably skeptical management that the lead role in the play be given to Christine Daa\u00e9, under penalty of devastating punishment. The new owners laughed off a warning that they might hear rumors of ghosts, so it's the fact that they similarly ignore the Phantom's warning is to be expected. In this version that Phantom takes the terrified Christine into his dungeon because he loves her, \"so that which is good within my, aroused by your purity, might plead for your love.\" As is also stated in the film, man's hatred made him into the Phantom, and he needs her love to redeem him.The Phantom is constantly making gestures with his hands that give the appearance that he is about to pull off his mask, which is one of the brilliant ways the film adds to the suspense of Christine pulling it off. There is an impressive psychological subtlety here, as the film makes a comment on mankind's need to see and touch, our inability to leave things unseen, even when we know that they are better off unseen. Everything must be touched, experience, and, in this case, corrupted, even to theirs and our own detriment. Christine is humanity.The infamous chandelier is indeed one of the stars of the film and the story itself, as it is the Phantom's instrument of his most extensive murderous damage, but its effects are almost immediately forgotten. Even though the scene after it falls is the one where Raoul and Christine meet against the Phantom's instructions is the only one that really shows that they truly love each other, this takes place the night after presumably dozens of people were killed or injured in that very room. I would think that the Phantom would have been upset as much by the lack of remorse shown by the people that he intends to punish and frighten as he was at the reunion of Raoul and Christine.The Secret Police officer is one character that has been removed for the 2004 version, which is too bad because he added a great element of possibility to the movie, as he is initially thought to be the Phantom in disguise but ultimately reveals himself to be an officer who has been studying the Phantom for months in his attempts to capture him. The character makes for a great chase sequence of sorts late in the film, in which he and Raoul attempt to capture him in his dungeon home. In the climactic scene Raoul and the officer are in some sort of an oven-room being baked by the Phantom, who demands Christine's love in order to save them (the 2004 version of this scene, again, is strikingly different), but they escape into a nearby room full of gunpowder. Nevermind the influence this must have had on National Treasure, the important thing is that this shows that the Phantom had some explosive plans. He is a character for whom we are meant to have limited sympathy.Although Chaney's powerful performance is the biggest aspect of this film production, Christine is the star of the story in this movie. She doesn't love the Phantom, obviously, but needs him to bestow upon her the talent necessary for her to achieve the stardom the she so strongly desires. Once she sees his disfigured face, she immediately calls upon Raoul to save her from him. It is important that she seeks Raoul's help only after seeing the Phantom's face, calling into question the realness of her love for him. Both men love Christine, but she loves neither of them. Her desire for fame turns to a desire to be saved from a man of whom she is terribly frightened but who is in love with her, and her only savior is a man who will similarly expect a lifetime of love and devotion from her but with whom she is certainly not in love either. The tragedy is Christine's, not the Phantom's.I was initially wondering about the point of having Christine turn a scorpion or a grasshopper to indicate her answer rather than simply saying yes or no, but it allows a great opportunity to have a deathly hazard befall the police officer and Raoul as a result of Christine's actions. The Phantom redeems himself by helping to pull them out the trapdoor, which finally brings sympathy to the fate that he ultimately suffers, which is similar to that suffered by Frankenstein's monster in James Whale's unfaithful 1931 adaptation, which was invented for that movie, as is this one. Nevertheless, the reputation that this film has as the best Phantom adaptation ever made are richly deserved. This is a milestone in film history.", "It's pointless to write a plot summary of this--everyone knows the story!Universal decided to film this back in 1924 with the then very popular Lon Chaney in the title role. Unfortunately, it was a nightmare. Director Julien constantly fought with Chaney and stormed off the set more than once.Things got so bad Julien was fired and somebody else was brought in to finish the film. Even Chaney himself directed a few scenes. Costar Mary Philbin also hated doing the film--the constant fighting got on her nerves. It's a miracle this turned out as good as it did.It's very well-directed (nice use of shadows and light and dark) and has an excellent performance by Chaney. Philbin is quite good too (even it she does overdo it a few times). The sets are big and very elaborate and there's a color costume party in the middle, with the Phantom showing up looking quite scary as the Red Death. The sequence in which he spies in Christine and the Count on the roof of the Opera House is VERY effective--that skull face of his will not leave me and the billowing red cape is eerie. The unmasking scene still can make you jump and the film moves at a VERY quick pace (it's only 90 minutes).I just saw the newly restored version--it looks incredible. The picture is (more or less) clear, all the reels have color tinting (which helps) and the color in the costume ball has never looked stronger. Just try to see it with the orchestra only score. The prints with sound effects and voices added (for the 1929 reissue) doesn't work. It's not perfect. The first half drags a little and characters and situations are introduced with no warning (this film was cut severely before it was released). But, after the unmasking, this film kicks into high gear and never stops.It's Chaney's show all the way--he's just great using hand gestures to signal his feelings and emotions. His makeup as the Red Death and the Phantom are very impressive--and still scary. Some people have said he overacts toward the end--but it works! There's a now classic scene at the end when he holds a crowd back with something in his hand (supposedly).A true classic and a perfect movie to see around Halloween. A definite must-see. Try to see the newly restored version.", "After all these years, the Lon Chaney silent version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" is still a terrific movie that adds great visuals and details to the classic story.  Without any of the advantages of later eras, it creates a vivid and remarkable world for the mysterious 'phantom' to live in.  Chaney himself makes a great phantom, giving a memorable interpretation to his character's appearance and personality.The settings perfectly match both the phantom and the story, and many of the distinctive sights remain with you after it is over.  A lot of creativity and attention to detail must have gone into them, and scenes such as the Technicolor Bal Masque sequence had to have taken a lot of extra work, but it certainly pays off.  Several of the scenes are particularly memorable in combining vivid settings with suspenseful events.The many later versions of the story may have the advantage of modern techniques and resources, but no version shows more of an appreciation for the story's potential than the Chaney version does.  Whether you like silent movies or horror movies or both, make sure to see this one.", "Analyzing an old silent movie using nowadays standards wouldn't be fair: the medium is too different, the acting performances require a different perspective, and when you watch it you find yourself enjoying the movie much like you would do with a painting. This is especially true for the classic The Phantom of the Opera, a movie that gets you lost in the images more than in the story itself.Lon Chaney gives a good portrayal of the phantom, yet somewhat different from what was portrayed in later efforts with the same subject: his character comes off more like a cold blooded than a somewhat likeable character. What shines in this movie is the visual impact: the costumes are really nice, and the gothic scenery is perfect. The best scene of them all has to be the Red Death one, appropriately shot in a painting-like color, definitely one of the most beautiful images offered by old cinema.Sure, the movie is hardly gonna provide any scares by now, and the story has been told many times. However, this is a primary example of how old cinema can still offer a very worthy experience.", "Beneath the Paris streets are a series of tunnels and catacombs, and beneath the opera house lives a man known as the phantom (Lon Chaney). He has lurked in the background for some time, but when he sees his heart's desire, Christine, he emerges and wreaks havoc on the opera house if they do not make her the star. Opposition arises.The film's quality, for its time period, is very impressive, far greater than the \"Hunchback\" film just a few years prior. Everything is crisp and clean, very much a modern film, though with a lack of sound. I saw this on the big screen with live organ accompaniment, the only real way to see a silent film. The music is phenomenal and only heightened the greatness of this classic.One must also point out the architecture. I am unclear where this was filmed, but the underground arches and tunnels were beautiful, Gothic and looming. At times I found myself distracted from the action to admire the craftsmanship of the background. I am curious about this.Lon Chaney's makeup in this one is celebrated, and with good reason: this is probably his best disguise. Again, in \"Hunchback\", he was good but somewhat silly. Here he is creepy, ugly and indeed terrifying. Some have written of the intense process Chaney put into this look, and I have no doubt of these tales... he looks as disfigured as a man could look without real facial destruction.Chaney is praised by all, from the claim that this is \"the star's best vehicle\" by Howard Maxford, to the thought that this was \"one of Chaney's most impressive acting jobs\" by Mike Mayo. I am at no liberty to disagree. The way the man uses body language and his hands to portray emotion (since he cannot speak in a silent film) is incredible -- and not just here. Anyone who wants to see Chaney's skill should check out \"The Unknown\", where he was an armless knife thrower.As I said above, the only way to see this film is on the big screen with live organ accompaniment. However, since this is not possible for most people, I suggest the next best thing: the Blu-ray from Image Entertainment. This disc is unbelievable, with three versions of the film to watch, three unique scores to listen to... and even an audio commentary from movie historian (and Lon Chaney biographer) Jon Mirsalis. I listened to it, and even if you think you know all there could be to know about this film... you will learn from Mirsalis. All fans of horror or classic cinema must, must, must own this disc.", "The Phantom of the Opera is, simply put, a great story about evil and unrequited love. Such is precisely the stuff Lon Chaney seems to adore, always finding himself in roles of an ambiguous nature.Whereas this film isn't quite as multifaceted as, say, the 2004 Phantom of the Opera, it still holds its mystery at a smaller, more harrowing level. Gone are the sympathies for the Opera Ghost, yet still his pain remains. All of it is contained in just one shot, the moment when Christine takes off his mask and both he and she recoil in the horror of the unveiling. It's enough to make the audience recoil too... even modern day ones used to make-up and even more. It's a testament to the power of the moment over the power of the image, and it sticks with you as you continue to watch the rest of the film.Interesting to look at is it's similarities, rather than its differences, to our more contemporary work. For instance, the Bal Masque (Masquerade now) is in color... and it's obviously the inspiration for nearly all the mise-en-scene on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage show and the Schumacher film.The writing is very good, but since it's more about a style of horror, it contains much less sympathy or even character development. Christine Daae is, in fact, rather something of a wench. Nobody cares about Raoul. The Phantom is much more evil and much less tender. Still good, but not preferential to how the story has evolved now.--PolarisDiB", "As silent films go, this one is pretty good. Though it gets off to a slow start, the plot eventually picks up, and is easy to follow. Living alone, and presumably lonely, in a subterranean maze beneath the Paris opera house, the phantom, known as Eric (Lon Chaney), sets his desires on Christine (Mary Philbin), a singer. Though there are secondary characters, the story centers on Eric and his actions to claim Christine for himself.Is Eric for real? We're given no back-story. He has no apparent means of survival. All we know about him is that he wears a mask, desperately wants Christine, and has enormous technical skills that allow him, beyond all reason, to furnish his lair with a large organ, to set traps for his enemies, and to control his underground world via remote control. I don't think we, as viewers, are supposed to ask too many questions about how all this works.Nevertheless, a big part of why this film appeals to me is its hidden, subterranean physical spaces, a kind of labyrinthine cave, so close to the opera house yet socially far removed, the perfect abode for a disfigured human reject.With his grotesque makeup and expressive body language, Lon Chaney gives a fine performance, actually much better than the other performers who overact in a melodramatic way. I thought the film's ending could have been a little more imaginative.The introduction of crude colors in a few scenes conveys a welcome Gothic tone to the film. Several scenes, like Eric's unmasking and the Masked Ball, are quite famous. Even if a viewer doesn't normally care for silent films, he or she needs to see \"The Phantom of the Opera\". This 1925 film is one of the most well respected of the silent era.", "Lon Chaney, Sr. gives a legendary performance as well as making an everlasting horrifying spectacle of himself.  The make-up and elaborate sets are truly to be held in awe, even by today's standards.  The rare use of two-strip Technicolor brings dazzling effect to the incomparable masquerade ball scene.  Sit back and enjoy the silent and definitive film version of a classic monster fable that sound, technology and time have yet to top.  8 Stars", "Let's face it, the original novel would be a hard piece of fiction for any screenwriter to translate to the screen. It's told in a style that is not conducive to film or theater--so it's wonderful that this particular story has had so many stage and screen treatments.This treatment has to be viewed in the context of 1925 film-making. As such, it's indeed an extraordinary achievement. However, modern viewers have to make allowances for the style of acting that was acceptable then--namely, overacting in a theatrically absurd manner.Having said that, the story about a figure who haunts the Paris opera house and lives in an underground world among the sewers, needs no introduction to most people. The flaws in the story are precisely because the screenplay tries to be as faithful as possible to the original work--no small task in view of the tangled structure of the novel.Lon Chaney is at his most intriguing as the masked Phantom and, fortunately, does not overplay his role to the extent that others in the cast do. There are several standout scenes that involve some fantastic camera-work--and the viewer will no doubt remember them long after seeing the film. The masked ball (filmed in early two-strip Technicolor) is one of them--where the Phantom makes an unforgettable entrance. And the rooftop scene tinted in blue where the only other color is the sinister blood red of the Phantom's cape being whipped by the wind. As for the unmasking of the Phantom, I don't believe it has the same effect today as it did originally. Chaney's make-up is grotesque but today's audiences have seen much worse--and most viewers are more sophisticated and desensitized about horror since then.If you're a Chaney fan, this is the one you must see. For those who are not used to silent film technique in acting, it may be a different matter.Personally, I love the \"Phantom\" story and enjoyed very much the Claude Rains re-make (with Nelson Eddy and Susanna Foster from 1943) that made superb use of Technicolor and a musical score by Edward Ward that seemed to dominate the proceedings. It also used some of the same underground passages and waterways as in this 1925 film, since it was made at the same studio. It was an entirely different take on the tale, explaining just why the Phantom turned to the sewers for escape and gave us a bravura performance by Claude Rains, as well as some excellent arias from Eddy and Foster.And speaking of music, this version with a newly added score by Carl Davis, benefits greatly from his music for the opera sequences and even the dramatic moments. It gives the whole film a more forceful presentation.", "The classic tale of a disfigured composer who falls in love with a beautiful singer has been told many times but only once has the phantom been beautifully portrayed like the way Lon Chaney did. It was an elaborate 1925 Universal production that is legendary. The film is in my opinion the greatest silent movie I have ever seen. It is creepy, yet enticing and the production value is astounding, especially the chandelier scene. The scene that truly steals the cake is when the mask is unveiled, to what is considered the most shocking scene ever done in a silent movie. The color ballroom scene when the phantom is red death is truly uncanny, but the scene after where he is agonizing on top of the opera house with his cape blowing and tons of emotions are being expressed while his red cape is blowing in the air and he is the only color in the scene. This movie was among 400 others that were nominated or AFI's top 100 movies, but did not make it. Whether you believe it should or should not, Phantom of the Opera is a sight to behold and the Phantom of the Opera will always be here inside all of our minds.", "Lon Chaney's 1925 THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA has always been more of a popular than a critical favorite, and this may account for the fact that it has never preserved as well as one might hope. Over the years dozens of companies have released versions of the film on VHS and DVD to the home market, and some have been quite bizarre. I have encountered more than one video tape release without any score at all; a visually impressive 1993 video release by Video Treasures had an incredibly unsuitable pseudo-rock score by Rick Wakeman of the band Yes; the usually expert Kino actually includes a number of superfluous scenes added in 1929 for a semi-sound re-release. So any purchase of this film is a very hit or miss affair, and I recommend that you borrow, rent, and seek the advice of friends before you actually purchase any particular copy.That said, the silent version of THE PHANTOM is very much in the \"grand manner\"--which is precisely why audiences love it and critics tend to dismiss it. Everything about the film is larger than life just a bit campy. The sets are enormous and frequently bizarre, the costumes are outrageous, and the entire cast plays in a very grand manner: Chaney is very, very broad here, and his make-up is justly famous; Mary Philbin totters improbably with horror in virtually every scene; Arthur Edmund Carewe has some of the weirdest eye make-up you'll ever see on screen. Chandeliers crash, ballerinas twirl in terror, mirrors open, lakes drain, audiences panic, horses run away with carriages, peasants riot in the street, and there's even (in a good print) a very early color photography sequence.It is all a TREMENDOUS amount of fun, and while I wouldn't class it with the truly great Chaney films (such as X--THE UNKNOWN, to name but one) it is still the best film version of the famous story to date. Of all the films made of the Leroux novel, this one is easily the best--and, interestingly, is really closer to the novel's spirit than later adaptations, which tend to romanticize the Phantom. A must have for any fan of silent film, and well worth the hunt for a really good print.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "Turner Classic Movies owns a restored copy of this film, which I saw from beginning to end for the first time last night. Thanks Ted!For an 80 year old film, I was honestly swept away by the strengths of this production. OK, once you get past some of the hammy acting, remembering that it was completely de reguer for the time, you get caught up in it.It has a very steady editing pace, which carries you along in the story, and so there are few, if any, slow points. The plotting and narrative are clear, there are no ' what did he say/mean' moments. The characters are pretty well filled out (there are a few exceptions, most notable the character of the boyfriend/hero) and so the plot wraps around you easily and enjoyably. The production values are amazingly high in this film, the recreation of the Opera (the grand staircase, the auditorium and the stage) the underground (the Phantom's lair, the underground river, the chambers and sub-chambers) and the exteriors were all created in Hollywood full scale. Unlike now, when we would have gotten some truly terrible CGI trash, when that chandelier drops from ceiling\u0085it's a real chandelier, it's a real ceiling and its really COOL!Cant leave out the amazing secret that few if any talk about, but did you know that not only are certain scenes single color tinted, but there is an amazing 2 strip Technicolor sequence, the Masked Ball, that takes place on the grand staircase. Further, there is an stunning sequence that takes place on the roof of the Opera, the Phantom lurking on the parapet, his 'Red Death' costume from the ball billowing behind him in the wind while he stalks the heroine.If you are expecting buckets of blood and Spiderman-like effects, this isn't the film for you. If you are looking for a fun film with romance, adventure and thrills in it, if you have an appreciation for classic film making, or just want a film you can watch with the kids, this one has a lot to offer."], "tt0016545": ["Beautiful silent film set in a wilderness logging camp. I really wish that I had seen this on a big screen in a good print instead of on video with a lousy video source. The title comes from a man who gets a transfusion of wolf blood and begins to think he's a wolf. Its not a wolf man story despite what the material on the DVD box says. The rest (most) of the plot has to do with a new owner for the logging company and what happens when a young woman ends up in the woods and in the middle of a romantic triangle. Its not a bad film, but its nothing spectacular. What I'm going to remember is the outdoor photography which is absolutely stunning. I'm in awe of how silent films have such great cinema verite shots of life that were often dropped into films. I know that the disappearance of the real life shot disappeared with the coming of sound because of the sound equipment was too bulky, but at the same time documentary filming like that was never the same. Worth a look for the photography. The plot is just okay.", "Despite the title, this isn't a horror film at all; the werewolf elements are only introduced three-quarters of the way in \u0096 which are, in any case, merely suggested through the lead character's hallucinations \u0096 but these obviously constitute the film's highlight (though rugged, pasty-faced star and co-director Chesebro isn't exactly Lon Chaney Jr.); still, the transformation-by-transfusion is an interesting concept, one which I don't think has been done in subsequent films. However, while the forest locations are certainly nice, the unexciting main narrative involving rival logging companies and the unavoidable love triangle really drown the interest; a subplot involves a villainous moonshiner who's a dead ringer for Walter Brennan \u0096 and, for the record, there's even an interminable \"Jazz Age\" party sequence towards the beginning! The soundtrack accompanying the print I watched features a classical piece which was also used \u0096 to much greater effect \u0096 in Luis Bunuel's L'AGE D'OR (1930).", "A nascent werewolf picture which, despite its promising premise, carefully avoids a descent into lycanthropy, this \"tale of the forest\" will disappoint most horror fans. However, it does have other points of interest including its attractively tinted location photography and its fascinating cast headed by the famous silent star, the charming Marguerite Clayton, here nearing the end of her 180-movies career!Doubtless for reasons of economy, George Chesebro was handed the reins to direct many of his own scenes. Unfortunately, he opted to adopt the clownish make-up he sported in the 1920 serial, \"The Lost City\", and he looks a real sight with his ghost-white face, black-rimmed eyes and painted smile. And this is before he thinks he might turn into a werewolf!Chesebro is joined by his sidekick pal from \"The Lost City\", Frank Clark, but it's prolific character actor Milburn Morante who easily steals this picture from both of them.The scenes directed by Bruce Mitchell are much smoother and far more natural than the Chesebro footage. And in his delightfully foot-tapping, jazz party sequence, the beautifully tinted images often give the lustrous impression of early two-strip Technicolor.", "Already seen all of Universal's \"Wolf Man\" movies? Want something more? Well, here's a little piece of werewolf movie history you probably never even knew about.It's really more of a romance story than a werewolf story, but it's definitely the werewolf aspect that makes it interesting. Two logging companies are rivals with one another, and Dick Bannister, played by George Chesebro, is the head of one of them. When the other company starts shooting and wounding his men, he telephones the city and sends his boss and a surgeon. It just so happens that his boss is a young woman, played by Marguerite Clayton, and she is engaged to a surgeon. Bannister instantly falls in love with her when she arrives.Later, the rival logging company begins to build a dam across a vital river. When Bannister confronts them, they attack him and leave him for dead ... but he is saved by the surgeon and taken to a nearby cabin. The owner of the cabin refuses to give his blood for a transfusion to save Bannister, as they have previously argued about him selling alcohol to the loggers, but suggests that he can use the blood of his she-wolf instead. He does, and Bannister lives.But when word gets out that he has wolf's blood in his veins, his superstitious employees begin to fear that he is no longer human, but some kind of man-beast. Bannister himself also begins to fear that this is the case, and his fears become deepened when the head of the rival logging company is torn apart by a pack of wolves. He starts to go slowly insane, hallucinating that he is part of a pack of phantom ghost wolves running through the woods nearby ... but when the girl returns his love, he snaps out of it and all is well. Yipee! \"Wolf Blood\" is the only time George Chesebro ever directed, but he has acted in over four hundred movies. Ouch! He gives a good silent performance here, and it seems fairly well-directed for it's time. The acting is pretty much what you expect from this period of film history -- melodramatic and stagey, with every movement and facial expression emphasised. It has it's dull moments, but the last ten minutes or so are particularly memorable.While it's certainly not a classic, this is a fairly interesting and entertaining silent movie, and notable as George Chesebro's single directorial project.", "Be advised that this film was released by Alpha Video--a company that ever seems to do any restoration on their films. This is especially problematic for old silent films like this one, as the print is so poor it's almost not worth seeing the film. But, in many cases, there are no other companies releasing that particular video, so you either take it or leave it! As I am a nut about silents, I realized the print would totally suck--so it wasn't any surprise that it did. As for the other full-length film on the same DVD (\"The Haunted Castle\"), its quality was a lot worse--much, much worse.The film is set in a logging camp in the rugged wilderness. Dick is trying to keep the project going, but someone is shooting at his men! Who and why isn't clear, but they need to get the owner involved as well as a good doctor to patch up the men. The company is owned by a rich society lady (Edith) who agrees to come to the middle of nowhere with her fianc\u00e9--who is also a doctor.After some scrappin' and punchin' and other manly stuff, Dick is hurt and possibly dying. With him needing a transfusion quickly, the doctor tries something REAAALLLY weird--gives him a transfusion of wolf blood! Dick is back to his old self in a few days--during which time the fair Edith cares for him--and falls for him.When Dick is up and about, everything seems peachy and he is blissfully unaware of the canine blood within him. But, a jerk (who happens to be a TERRIBLE actor) who knows the truth begins spreading the story about the wolf blood and people in the camp all begin acting strangely whenever Dick is about. Soon, he, too, hears about the blood and he begins to believe the silly tales about him becoming a were-wolf! Only after he is saved from killing himself by Edith does he and the audience learn the truth--through a very long exposition! Not exactly a terrific way to end a film, huh?!This film has a decent story idea and it would have been better had it been made featuring competent actors and director. So, although there should be suspense, there really is none. The story comes off as silly and the occasionally bad acting of a few of the cast sure didn't help. Often with silents I cut them some slack--after all, they are early films and so I compare them to other films of the same era. And, compared to other silents of 1925 (by which time the quality of films had become excellent), it was poor all around and aside from an interesting plot idea, the film has little to offer--particularly as the print is just awful.", "Wolf Blood (1925)** (out of 4)In the Canadian wilderness, a logger is injured and near death when a doctor gives him a blood transfusion from a wolf. The man eventually lives but soon he begins to fear he's turning into a wolf. Well, I guess Werewolf of London wasn't the first \"werewolf\" movie. There aren't any transformation scenes here but it's very clear to see that the final fifteen minutes of this influenced the screenplay of The Wolf Man. The film runs a quick 68-minutes but the wolf action really doesn't start until the very end. Up until that point, we've got a pretty over-dramatic love story that doesn't work at all. None of the actors are that interesting and the technical style looks like 1910 and not what we'd expect from 1925. Those interested in the wolf aspect might want to check it out for a historical purpose but others stay clear.", "Half the film involves trees falling down and the same stock footage of the lumber industry. There are two warring camps. One is sending men to shoot the workers in the other camp. It is getting ugly. There are so many injuries that the foreman (a sort of Nelson Eddy kind of guy) gets in touch with the owner (who happens to be a rich flapper, engaged to a surgeon). She goes to the camp with her fianc\u00e9. He will do the doctoring while she assesses the situation. There is no reason for her to be there other than to advance the plot and get her to fall in love with the handsome foreman. At some point, the guy (who acts before thinking) finds that the opposing camp is about to dam up the river and ruin their business. After a confrontation with a couple of lumberjacks, he is knocked unconscious and thrown in a ravine. He is later found by the surgeon who is put in a position of using wolf blood to save his life. Of course, he now begins to act wolf-like. Some say this was the first werewolf movie. There are some fun moments, but, over all, it is just quite moronic.", "After a wolf blood transfusion, a man (George Chesebro) thinks he is becoming a wolf.This film came to my attention as being \"the first werewolf movie\". Strictly speaking, that is not correct. The first werewolf movie is The Werewolf\" (1913). However, as that film is considered to be lost, ore \"Wolf Blood\" can be called the earliest surviving werewolf film, which is the next best thing.Although George Chesebro (who both stars and directs) is not a well-known name, perhaps he should be. The Minnesota-born film star appeared in more than 400 films between 1915 and 1954, which is nothing to sneeze at! Oddly, it gets to the wolf part until halfway through, first focusing on 1920s dance parties and lumber companies (reminding me of Howard Hawks' \"Come and Get It\"). Much of the werewolf part is told through possible hallucinations, and we are never completely convinced that he has joined the pack.Interesting for what it is, but probably not a must-see.", "Wolf Blood (1925) is NOT the first werewolf film - that title goes to Universal's long lost film \"The Werewolf\" (1913). BUT it might be fair to say that Wolf Blood (1925) is the first surviving film concerning lycanthropy and second werewolf film made.Fun note: It is said that most film historians say that it is Universal's \"Werewolf of London\" (1935) that is the first werewolf film - yet we have \"Wolf Blood (1925) that deals with the subject and before that the long lost film \"The Werewolf\" (1913).My problem with Wolf Blood (1925) is that they took too much time to get to the point - it took the first 35 minutes (out of 107 minutes) to get to our \"werewolf\". We did not need 35 minutes worth of background on \"romance\" and two rival logging companies because the film's focus is suppose to be on the wolf's blood in the man's veins. We really only needed about 10 to 15 minutes for the background NOT 35 minutes worth - they could have used the extra time to build suspense surrounding the wolf's blood in the man's vein and how it was effecting him psychologically, local superstitions concerning werewolves etc.Now once we finally got to our \"werewolf\" the film was pretty good.... just not enough focus on the reason people would want to see the film: lycanthropy - even if it is only in a person's mind.The movie is however worth watching just because it is the first surviving film on the subject and the second film ever made about it. I do not consider this a horror film - just a drama.6/10", "This was really good decent drama , someone told me it was a horror.As it was the first, kind of werewolf movie however there are no actually werewolf in this.A man thinks, he is turning into a werewolf after being injected by wolf blood.After he was beaten up and left for death but start to thing he belongs with the pack of wolves.After hearing that people, who attacked him, have been killed and mauled by a animal.7 out of 10", "Somewhere in a Canadian forest there are two competing lumber camps - one good, one evil - the owner of the latter hires thugs to attack folks from the former to try and put them out of business. This course of action results in one such victim being given an emergency transfusion of wolf's blood leading him to believe he is a wolf, including hallucinations of phantom wolves.The above synopsis probably makes Wolf Blood seem a lot more interesting than it actually is. Unfortunately, despite how it is marketed nowadays, it's not a werewolf film. It isn't even a horror movie at all. Instead it's a melodrama with a little bit of fantasy elements added towards the end. Sadly, the narrative is somewhat dull and the wolf material is only introduced three quarters of the way in. It's here where the film has some potential but it's too little too late. And so, despite some great location photography, the result is one of the most lacking silents I have seen.", "Fully half of 'Wolf blood' is filled with scenes that can scarcely be described as plot, serving little to no purpose except as crude, excessive exposition. Once meaningful narrative does begin, around the 30-minute mark, the story still mostly plods along lackadaisically, with no care for having any impact. Minimal and uncomplicated as this tale is, plot progression is piecemeal, and largely saved for at best the last 20 minutes. Hints of humor in some intertitles are far outweighed by direly tawdry ham-handedness, in dialogue and narration alike, and overall narrative.And as to that plot: If you want a drama flavored with romance, this is the movie for you. If you've been drawn in owing to the feature's description as an early example of horror in cinema, I fear you've been misled. Nearly 100 years removed, I don't suppose any material still remains that could illuminate how 'Wolf blood' was marketed to audiences. In retrospect it's hailed as, accordingly, the \"earliest surviving werewolf film.\" But the nearest the picture gets to realizing that notion is in the mere suggestion that the indicated character is \"neither man nor beast.\"I readily acknowledge that this could be an instance in which expectations unfairly color my opinion of a feature. To regard 'Wolf blood' as a lycanthrope story is to guarantee disappointment. The only way in which the movie could be described as horror generally - very loosely and generously, and perhaps in terms relevant to early genre pieces - is insofar as the character of Dick Bannister is somewhat isolated as an outcast, and experiences a night of seeming maddening delirium as he ponders his circumstances. Yet even this constitutes only a marginal fraction of the runtime. The picture can be more accurately described as a straightforward drama, though even through that lens, about an entire half of the length remains superfluous, and the questionable writing still stands. There are admirable themes on hand to one extent or another including superstition, stigma, and prejudice, but these also get buried within the inelegant screenplay.It's not altogether bad, but the film is dubious without the added burden of labels that misrepresent the content. On the one hand I feel like I'm being too kind, and on the other, too harsh; this equivocation is itself a poor sign. There are worse movies you could find yourself watching, but also so many more that are much better. Unless one is a devotee of the silent era and eager to absorb all the style has to offer, I can't especially imagine recommending 'Wolf blood.' It's passable, but only just, and I don't think that is quite enough.", "Possible spoilers. This is an unusual story set in a lumber camp in Canada. It concerns rival lumber camps at war. When the head foreman of the one camp is beaten and left for dead, a surgeon is forced to use the blood of a wolf for a transfusion. Like many movies of the 20s this one is filled with long boring stretches and a couple of intriguing scenes. One chilling scene has the man who has been transfused with the wolf blood following after a pack of phantom wolves towards the edge of a cliff where the wolves jump off one by one. There is also a scene of a Roaring 20s party in full swing that has little to do with the rest of the movie but is of interest to fans of flappers and the culture of the 20s. One thing that always cracks me up watching silent films is the actors in them. Many of them are so ordinary looking that they could not possibly star in a Hollywood film today. The star here, George Chesebro, looks like a mechanic at a gas station but turns in a good performance nonetheless. Considered a forerunner of the Wolfman movies of the 40s, but the Wolfman is only hinted at in this one."], "tt0016847": ["To fans of early horror, director F.W. Murnau is best known for 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens,' his chilling 1922 vampire film, inspired by Bram Stoker's famous novel. However, his equally impressive 'Faust' is often overlooked, despite some remarkable visuals, solid acting, a truly sinister villain, and an epic tale of love, loss and evil. The story concerns Faust (G\u00f6sta Ekman), an old and disheartened alchemist who forms a pact with Satan's evil demon, Mephisto (Emil Jannings). As God and the Devil wage a war over Earth, the two opposing powers reach a tentative agreement: the entire fate of Mankind will rest on the soul of Faust, who must redeem himself from his selfish deeds before the story is complete.Relying very heavily on visuals, 'Faust' contains some truly stunning on screen imagery, most memorably the inspired shot of Mephisto towering ominously over a town, preparing to sow the seeds of the Black Death. A combination of clever optical trickery and vibrant costumes and sets makes the film an absolute delight to watch, with Murnau employing every known element \u0096 fire, wind, smoke, lightning \u0096 to help produce the film's dark tone. Double exposure, in which a piece of film is exposed twice to two different images, is used extremely effectively, being an integral component in many of the visual effects shots. In fact, aside perhaps from Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m's 'K\u00f6rkarlen (1921),' I can't remember double exposure being used to such remarkable effect.It's often difficult to judge performances in a silent film, but I've certainly got a generally positive attitude towards the acting in 'Faust.' I was particularly astonished by G\u00f6sta Ekman, whose character, given limitless evil control, is transformed from a withering old man to a handsome youth. Despite my impression that two different actors had been used, it seems that Ekman convincingly portrayed both the old and young man, which is a credit to both the actor and Murnau's make-up department (namely, Waldemar Jabs). Emil Jannings plays Mephisto with a sort of mysterious slyness, always one step ahead and always up to no good. Whilst I wasn't completely blown away by young actress Camilla Horn as Gretchen \u0096 the woman with whom Faust falls in love \u0096 her acting is adequate enough, and she certainly shows some very raw emotion in the scene's final act, when her forbidden romance with Faust sends her life in a downward spiral.'Faust' was F.W. Murnau's final film in Germany, his next project being the acclaimed American romance, 'Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927).' At the time, the film was the most expensive ever made by the German studio, UFA (Universum Film AG), though it would be surpassed the following year by Fritz Lang's classic science-fiction epic, 'Metropolis.' Notably, there were five substantially different versions of 'Faust' produced, several of these by the director himself: these include a German original version, a French version, a late German version, a bilingual version for European audiences, and an American cut compiled by Murnau especially for MGM in July 1926. Each of these altered particular scenes and camera angles, and often included material that would be more relevant to the target cultural audience (for example, the US version reportedly contains a joke about the American Prohibition era).At the heart of 'Faust' is a love story between the corrupted title character and his doomed love, Gretchen. I felt that the scenes when Faust is trying to coax Gretchen into loving him were the slowest parts of the film, much less exciting and invigorating than the darker and more effects-driven sequences that preceded and followed it. Nevertheless, F.W. Murnau's 'Faust' is an absolute gem of 1920s silent horror, and anybody who doesn't look out for it is very surely missing out on something special.", "F.W. Murnau's telling of the classic German legend, 'Faust' is a masterpiece to behold. From both the technical and story standpoint, the film excels and despite being nearly eighty years old, Faust still stands tall as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time. F.W. Murnau has become best known among film fans for 'Nosferatu', but this is unfair to the man. While Nosferatu is something of an achievement; it pales in comparison to this film in every respect. Faust is far more extravagant than Murnau's vampire tale, and it shows his technical brilliance much more effectively. The story is of particular note, and it follows a German alchemist by the name of Faust. As God and Satan war over Earth, the Devil preaches that he will be able to tempt Faust into darkness and so has a wager with God to settle things. Satan sends Mephisto to Earth to offer Faust an end to the plague that is making it's way through the local population, and eternal youth, in return for Faust's soul...The way that Murnau creates the atmosphere in the film is nothing short of amazing. The lighting and use of shadows is superb, and helps to create a strong sense of dread at the same time as making the film incredibly easy on the eyes. It's the music that's the real star of the show, however, as it's absolutely fantastic and easily ranks up with the greatest scores ever written. The scenery is expressionistic and gives the film a strong sense of beauty (which is increased by the excellent cinematography), especially in the darker scenes; all of which are an absolute delight to behold. The story is undoubtedly one of the most important ever written, and within it is themes of good, evil, religion and most importantly, love. The points are never hammered home, and instead they are allowed to emancipate from the centre of the tale, which allows the audience to see them for themselves rather than being told; and that's just the way a story should be.It's hard to rate the acting in silent cinema as being a member of a modern audience, I'm used to actors acting with dialogue and judging a performance without that is difficult. However, on the other hand; silent acting is arguably more difficult than acting with dialogue as the only way to portray your feelings to the audience is through expressions and gestures, and in that respect; acting is just another area where this film excels. In fact, there isn't an area that this film doesn't excel in and for that reason; it easily ranks up with the greatest films ever committed to the screen.", "By 1925 UFA, German cinema's pioneer production company, was almost collapsing under the weight of mounting financial difficulties, having lost over eight million dollars in the fiscal year just ended. It was at this point that American film studios found the perfect opportunity they've been looking for to finally defeat their one opponent in the market of continental Europe. It was ironic that a film industry born out of the necessity of WWI and Germany's inability to provide American, British or French films in the years between 1914 and 1919 would go on to become Hollywood's number one opponent. Indeed Paramount and MGM offered to subsidize UFA's huge debt to the Deutsche Bank by lending it four million dollars at 7.5 percent interest in exchange for collaborative rights to UFA's studios, theaters, and personnel - an arrangement which clearly worked in the American companies' favor. The result was the foundation of the Parufamet (Paramount-UFA-Metro) Distribution Company in early 1926.This is only tangential to FAUST but important nonetheless to place the film in its correct historical context. Both as FW Murnau's last German film before he left for Hollywood and as UFA's most expensive production to that date. It is no wonder that within a year of accepting Hollywood as business partners, UFA was already showing losses of twelve million dollars and was forced to seek another loan, when FAUST, a film that cost them 2 million dollars alone and took six months to film only made back half of its budget at the box office. FAUST would go on to be succeeded by Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS as the most expensive German production but it remained FW Murnau's aufwiedersehen to Weimar cinema. He was one of many German film artists and technicians that migrated to sunny California following the Parufamet agreement (Fritz Lang would follow a few years later, having refused Goebbels' offer to lead the national film department for Nazi Germany, along with others like Paul Leni, Billy Wilder, Karl Freund and Ernst Lubitsch).Weimar cinema wouldn't make it past the 1930's and FW Murnau's career would come to an abrupt end with his death at 42 in a car accident, but FAUST, as the last German production, not only in nationality, but also in style and finesse, definitely deserves its place next to 1922's NOSFERATU in the pantheon of German Expressionism. Frontloaded in terms of spectacle and dazzling visuals, this retelling of Goethe's classic version of Dr. Faust's story is as slow paced and dark as Nosferatu but with the kind of fantastic, mystical and romantic blend that characterized German post-war cinema. A cinema aimed at repressed lower middle-classes which, in the absence of a national identity swept away by war, were now turning to a new cultural identity conscious of the social realities of the times. In that sense, Murnau's Faust is part escapism spectacle, part edifying fable on the corruption of evil and the redeeming qualities of love and forgiveness.And if the story is overwrought melodrama by today's standards, the magnificent sets constructed by UFA technicians and special effects work stand shoulder to shoulder with some of the best from the 20's. Mephisto looming black and gigantic over a town swept by plague is an iconic image etched on the same pantheon wall of German Expressionism as Count Orlok's shadow. The angels of death riding on their horses with beams of light shooting through them combines the dark fantasy of the production design with expressive lighting, the kind of which would eventually become shaped into film noir by directors like Otto Preminger and Fritz Lang. G\u00f6sta Ekman as Faust (superbly made-up as an old man to make even Welles green with envy) and Emil Jannings as Mephisto stand out among the cast.", "I think of Murnau's Faust as a masterpiece not only of cinema, but of the human imagination.  I understand that reviews at the time of its premier were lukewarm, but I honestly can't imagine not feeling grateful for the opportunity to see this film today.  Moments and images from it are so powerful, they are vivid in the mind years after seeing them -- two hours in a dream world.The flying sequence has been commented-on more than once, and with good reason.  It is a spectacular series of shots wherein the camera tracks through long miniature sets which gradually change from a dense cluster of medieval rooftops and steeples, to a tortuous countryside of mountain peaks and snake-like rivers, twisted trees, deep gorges with plunging waterfalls and stone cliffs, rapids, a field of long grass, elaborate renaissance architecture and an Italianate palace.  Along the way there is an encounter with grotesque elongated black birds in the sky, their wings flapping in unison.  The sets incorporate running water (with little bits of smoking material floating in the rapids to simulate splashes and spray), an illuminated moon, and smoke to simulate clouds and fog.  The whole sequence can't be much more than a couple of minutes long, but the effort to design, construct and coordinate the sequence must have been staggering.  The following palace scene is set on a huge multi-level set with female dancers stretching off into the distance.  They are there for no better reason than to establish an atmosphere of sumptuous decadence, and young Faust arrives in the middle of this riding between two enormous elephants, which seem to be entirely artificial and crafted of fabric, wire, etc.  So it goes throughout the production.  Almost every scene is a feast for the eyes, and the darker scenes are vividly expressionistic in design.The acting is the old-fashioned silent-movie variety of big operatic gestures and vivid facial expression.  It may seem odd to those not used to it, but it is NOT an example of ham actors overdoing it.  This was a legitimate style of acting in its time, and offers genuine artistic beauty to those who can manage to appreciate it.The fact that there seems to be no video version of `Faust' at the time of this posting is criminal.  Ditto for Murnau's \"Sunrise.\"  These things should NEVER be out of print.", "Title: FW Murnaus Faust (1926)Director: FW MurnauCast: Gosta Ekman, Camilla Horn, Emil Jannings, William Dieterle Review:Having seen Murnaus Nosferatu and having enjoyed it immensely I had to check out some of his other films. Faust quickly caught my attention. After Murnau made Nosferatu, he was given the opportunity to do whatever film he wanted..and they gave him the huge budget to do it. The result was an impressive, visually stunning, supernatural film.God and the Devil are fighting for who gets to control humanity. They do a wager, they decide that if Satan (aka as Mephisto) can corrupt Faust then all of humanity would belong to Mephisto. After the wager is on, Mephisto spreads the plague throughout Fausts town and people start dying. He decides to call upon the powers of darkness to help people out.First off, more then anything, this movie is a true visual feast. How Murnau made this movie with the limited resources he had at the time is a true testament to his talent as a filmmaker. Heck, it was 1926, before make up fx, before stan winston, before blue screens and CGI, before anything! Yet, he managed to create an incredibly rich film. Heck this guy even managed to do a crane shot in the movie! In a scene where Faust and Mephisto are flying through the sky's...the camera swoops over a landscape filled with waterfalls, mountains and cliffs...all in one shot! I was actually amazed how with their limited technological resources Murnau managed to do this type of shot back in those days.The imagery is amazing...starting with Mephisto spreading his gigantic black wings over Fausts small town. I kid you not when I say that, that image is one of the coolest images I have ever seen on any movie. Images of the horsemen of the apocalypse riding the sky's....angels with swords, Faust conjuring up Mephisto by reading from his book...man this movie was really something to behold. Its all wrapped around that black and white aura that gives the film that eerie feel. Kinda like the same feeling I got when I watched White Zombie. I love black and white horror visuals. And Faust was full of them.Of special interest to me was that scene where Faust conjures up Mephisto by reading some words from a book, its truly a great movie moment with an incredible supernatural feel. The visuals of those circles of light emanating from the ground up towards the sky...that was amazing. And actually I think that scene influenced Francis Ford Copolla in Bram Stokers Dracula because he uses the exact same image of circles of light emerging from the ground.Faust fantastical imagery truly demonstrates that Murnau had complete and total control over everything that he showed on the screen. The snow, the wind, the shadows, the lights...all perfectly handled to create the exact mood and feel that was required at them moment. Its quite obvious as well that this movies benefited from a much much bigger budget then Murnaus previous films. The sets look a lot like those on Caligari at times, the detailed miniatures are very well achieved and the extras are plentiful.The performances are great, better then in Nosferatu. They are sometimes a bit exaggerated, but not as much as in other silent films I've seen before. On this one, the performances seemed just right to me. Of special mention is Emil Jannings as Mephisto. This guy played Beelzebub with some real relish. The character comes off as evil, treacherous, calculating...and he does it all with this smirk on his face. Great character. The make up on him is great and he kinda reminded me at times of Bela Lugosi as Dracula. But overall, hes performance was the best in the film. I also really enjoyed Camilla Horn as Gretchen, her scenes with her baby in the snow were great not only in the acting department but visually as well.Overall, Id recommend this movie to those of you interested in German silent cinema. Its really something to see how even in those days, the imagination and creativity was there. And even the limited technological resources couldn't hold them back from creating a truly beautiful, haunting, spooky, supernatural film. For those of you who enjoyed films like Murnaus Nosferatu or Robert Wienes The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari then you will most certainly love Faust.I would certainly say it is far superior to the films mentioned before, yet for some reason doesn't get as much recognition. Check it out schmoes for a slice of the best horror silent cinema ever. Definitely worth a look.Rating: 5 out of 5", "Faust is my favourite German film, a timeless tale brought to life visually perfect by Murnau in 1926. The photography and special effects although obviously constrained by the prevailing technology was stunning and relentless, a tour de force of camera trickery to bring the power of the story across to Artheads and ordinary folk alike. Trouble is, it's a German b&w silent film so mainly Artheads and a few like me will ever see it for its beauty. Sunrise from a year later takes some beating but Faust does it easily.The Devil wants to rule so places a morally dubious wager that if he wins Dr. Faust's soul he wins the Earth. Faust falls into the snare and so begins his descent into Hell, along with the woman he has in one night of passion \u0096 \"No man can resist Evil\". After 9/11 can we really be sure who won? There's so many memorable scenes: The Devil lowering over the town (Jannings having to spend hours perched uncomfortably over billowing soot until Murnau was happy with the shot); Faust throwing his books on the fire in his fantastic room (with piles of dangerous nitrate film deliberately going up to help); the un-cgi magic carpet ride; Gretchen with her baby in the snow etc. Ekman and Jannings were especially superb in their respective roles, but everyone and everything played their parts well.The print is a knockout remaster, the menacing atmosphere whenever Faust or Mephisto are in shot is palpable as was only possible with nitrate film stock. Thoroughly recommended to those even only mildly interested who've never seen it before, one I will hopefully watch repeatedly in the future.", "Faust is a famous German story from Johann Wolfgang Goethe but to be honest I wasn't familiar with it until I saw this movie. Perhaps that's also why I liked the story so much, the movie changes direction time after time and from the beginning on you don't know how it is going to end. A great story of good versus evil in which love conquers all.What makes the movie very memorable is the visual look of it. The movie is filled with some truly amazing early special effects. F.W. Murnau truly was a master in using convincing early special effects in his movies, some scene's are really impressive. Also the cinematography is spectacular and it has some brilliant lighting.In many ways the movie was decades ahead of its time. The way the story is told in the movie is unique and spectacular for its period and so is the use of humor in it. All the scene's with Mephisto and Marthe Schwerdtlein were shear comedy brilliance, also mainly thanks to Emil Jannings his acting.Mephisto himself really was one scary great villain character, especially when the character is first introduced to Faust.Maybe not entirely a classic masterpiece, the middle and the drama is bit too much dragging and lacking for it but certainly a movie historical important and memorable movie. A F.W. Murnau movie that deserves to be seen by more.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "Personally, I have a love-hate relationship with horror milestones from the silent era. Some of them I rate as downright brilliant and are listed high in my favorites of all times (\"The Phantom Carriage\", \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\") but quite often I also literally have to struggle to stay awake throughout these so-called indestructible masterpieces. Murnau's \"Faust\" is definitely unique, because I experienced these two opposite sentiments during one film! The opening sequences are breathtaking. Unbelievably and utterly breathtaking, in fact. There's the grim prologue that covers a showdown between the archangel and Satan, with horrid images of the four horsemen and brimstone storms, and subsequently the temptation of the titular character (who sells his soul to Mephistopheles in return for youth), which is nothing short of jaw-dropping! What comes next is truly one of the most genius moments in cinema, namely the evil Mephistopheles towering over a little town and symbolically unleashing a plague on it. I think I must have re-watched that particular 7 or 8 times, simple because it's so stunning. But then something strange and incomprehensible happened. The rest of the film suddenly became tedious, prosaic and unremarkable. The content of young Faust wooing the beautiful Gretchen, while Mephistopheles distracts her deeply religious mother, is honestly rather dull and uninteresting. All the mind-blowing aspects of the opening sequences, such as the special effects and the camerawork of Carl Hoffman, are pushed to the background in favor of the mediocre romance plot. The finale finds Murnau returning to great shape, but the powerful impact of the first 15-20 minutes cannot be reached again.", "A lyrical fable version of Goethe's famous story, where Mephisto and an angel gamble with Faust's spirit, the entire film has an aura of delicate beauty. When Faust's town is shrouded with a pestilence, Faust summons Mephisto and agrees to a trial selling of his soul, in the hopes that he can save the townspeople. When Faust does indeed cure the town, Mephisto tempts him with the promise of youth and Gretchen, the most beautiful woman in Italy. Misty, often eerie, fiendish imagery, like satanic birds, hooded men, flying horsemen and Caligari-inspired exteriors fill the screen. When Faust signs his contract, the words burn themselves into the page as Mephisto dips his feather pen in Faust's vein. A wonderful touch near the beginning has Faust trying to escape Mephisto but having him appear wherever he goes, always a few steps ahead. Both Faust, as a young man, and Gretchen are lovely, and Jannings gives an excellent performance as the Dark Prince. A masterpiece of poetic atmosphere that ages Murnau's technical mastery wondrously, the film is aided tremendously by the sometimes ominous, sometimes enchanting orchestral score. 10/10", "Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau was the most important director of the German expressionism era. He made 22 films from which only 11 have persisted. Murnau often made several different versions of his films, which made it impossible to tell which was the original one. Faust was no exception; he made 9 different versions of it whose editing, rhythm and acting differ from each other. F.W. Murnau did a lot of breakthroughs in cinema - he's the most influential filmmaker of his time. For instance in his earlier film Der Letzte Mann (1924, The Last Laugh) Murnau used the camera as a character for the very first time. It was the first time the audience couldn't tell when you were watching the events as an outsider and when as a character. Faust is no lesser. Eric Rohmer has written about it in his dissertation and Herman G. Weinberg saw Faust as the most beautiful film ever made.Everybody knows the German writer Goethe who wrote Faust. But the story did live before his play. It lived as a folktale. And this is where the critics did wrong. They thought that Murnau's Faust was a fiasco; probably because they tried to compare it to the original play. But F.W. Murnau did Faust (1926) based on the folktale. So the philosophy of Goethe's Faust was left away. The production company (UFA) of Faust also produced another artistic film, Metropolis by Fritz Lang. When the audience didn't like either of these films the company failed.Faust is a story about God and Satan who wager. A man, Faust, agrees to sell his soul to Satan so he can have all the power of the world. First he wants to use the power to help the diseased people but the temptations of eternal youth and beauty win. \"Damned be the illusion of youth!\" Faust is a timeless story because the idea of selling one's soul will always be there. Faustic contracts are still made. There is only one thing that can terminate the contract. Liebe - Love. The flaming word appears on the screen to assure us. Earlier I mentioned the new camera-work of The Last Laugh. But Faust did something new too. It was the first film that was based on the metaphorical force of light and shadow. The use of shadows in Faust is symbolic and brilliant. When talking about light and Murnau one might be reminded of Nosferatu (1922), a Gothic vampire story by F.W. Murnau, where the beams of light killed Nosferatu.Faust deals with essential and timeless themes. On the surface the themes are good and evil but Faust is much more complex than that. I would recommend this masterpiece of the German Expressionism to all film lovers. I wouldn't be surprised if one said that Faust is the best film ever made. F.w. Murnau manages to capture real humane emotions.", "My first silent film lasted over two hours. Dialog full of screens after everything's been said. To be honest, I was surprised at how there was never a point of down, there was never a realization that I was watching a silent film, though it did take a bit of getting used to in the beginning. Some might get pushed away due to the fact that the screen transfer isn't great, or that the music has been recently dubbed, but I found it all to fit perfectly. The acting in this film is more than over expectation, that made me believe in the story from start to finish. By the end I had a new found admiration for the makers of movies from our past, and what standards they can set for movies now.", "I was so intrigued with this film. Taking the classic story of the man who sells his soul (initially to benefit humanity). Playing with shadows and religious symbols. Using Emile Jannings \"Mephisto\" as a three dimensional character, even comedic at times. I think what I like the most was how the middle ages, with the day to day cruelty of pestilence and want, unfolded. Murnau also did some sensational visuals--the apocalyptic visions, the spectre of Satan enshrouding the city, bringing the plague. The character of Faust and his failure to gain love--even though he bargained it away--is very poignant. Faust wants youth but has made a pact. If there is a shortcoming, Faust's debauchery is almost entirely off screen and Mephisto performs all the visible cruelty. The reclamation of the soul needs a little more to pair against. Of course, in many of the Faust presentations, he pays the ultimate price and is not able to repent.", "\"Faust\" was an ambitious effort from legendary German director F.W. Murneau to bring this classical tale to the screen. I didn't think it was as good as some of his earlier films but it is memorable nonetheless.God and Satan are fighting over who will control earth. God's messenger an unnamed Archangel (Werner Fuetterer) and Mephisto (Emil Jannings) each believe that the deserve the honor. They make a wager that Mephisto can bring an aging and respected alchemist named Faust (Gosta Ekmann) over to the side of evil. The wager is Faust's immortal soul.Mephisto immediately rains down a deadly plague upon Faust's city. People begin to die and panic sets in. Faust prays to God to alleviate the plague as he tries to minister to the sick. Finally he gives up and burns his books in disgust. One of the books shows him the way to summon up the devil to help him. Mephisto is conjured up and appears as an elderly agent of the devil who offers to grant Faust his every wish if he will sign a paper surrendering his soul. The two agree on a one trial period.As a first wish, Faust asks for his youth to be restored which it is. Mephisto too takes on a more youthful appearance. Then Faust and Mephisto soar over the city to the wedding of the Duke (Eric Barclay) and Duchess (Hanna Ralph) of Parma. There the young Faust offers her priceless gifts. She is mesmerized and goes off with Faust. The Duke tries to intervene but is slain by Mephisto. Just as Faust is about to have his way with the Duchess, the 24 hour trial period ends and the two return to their starting point..Next Faust asks to be returned to his home town where he meets the lovely young maiden Gretchen (Camilla Horn) frolicking in the garden with the children. She lives with her mother (Frida Richard) and her brother (William Dieterle) who has returned home on leave from the wars. She goes to see her Aunt Marthe (Yvette Guillbert) who sells phony love potions on the side.Faust takes up with Gretchen eventually getting her into the sack. Mephisto meanwhile goes to her brother and tells him that his sister is being defiled. Mother catches them in the act and dies in shock. The brother returns home and challenges Faust to a duel. The evil Mephisto stabs the brother in the back but before he dies labels his sister as a harlot and asks that she be put on display in the public square. Faust and Mephisto disappear.It seems that unbeknownst to Faust, he has left Grtechen with child. She wanders through the snow filled streets unable to gain shelter from the saintly townsfolk. The child dies and Gretchen is discovered shivering in the cold. She is charged as a child murderer and is sentenced to be burned at the stake. Fasust learns of her fate and begs Mephisto to let him return to her. But the evil Mephisto turns Faust back into an old man and..................................................I only have a couple of problems with this film. With Murneau being such a perfectionist, I wonder why he used such obvious miniatures for the city that Faust and Mephisto fly over. They look positively toy like. And, what was the frolicking about between Mephisto and Aunt Marthe all about? It was completely out of context with the rest of the story.This being the restored German version of the film, the character names are German and not Americanized as in the American version of the film.", "It's no surprise that F.W. Murnau's film version of \"Faust\" is so interesting and memorable. It seems almost to be ideal material for his style and skill, and indeed this movie combines the Faust story with plenty of Murnau's own touches. The creative visuals are probably the most impressive aspect of the feature, although Emil Jannings's performance is also impossible to overlook.The Faust legend is interesting enough simply as a story that it would be easy for a film-maker to focus on the story alone. It would also be easy to glamorize the power of Mephisto and the fascination that it holds for weak minds. But Murnau and Jannings make Mephisto appear interesting, powerful, and clever, while still never obscuring the shabby and hateful nature of his efforts to ensnare Faust. Faust himself faces not only the battle for his soul, but also the even more interesting struggle of making sense of everything.The early sequences are very effective in setting it all up. The initial temptations that the devil uses to entice Faust are interesting in their own right and also in terms of the larger issues, and the imagery that Murnau uses complements the events very well. It sets the stage nicely for the developments that follow, creating a very well-conceived version of the classic tale.", "A real miracle that brings this film back to life. 1926 in Germany produced many prodigies. Murnau chose to go back to the old traditional legend, hence to ignore Goethe's double drama and all the subsequent romantic or melodramatic adaptations in the 19th century. He also decided to ignore Marlowe's adaptation from 16th century England. He simplified the traditional tale and only had one simple episode of travelling through time, in this case to some Italian noble beauty that Faust rapes under the influence of some magic. Murnau chose to concentrate on the tale of Gretchen in the second part of the film (which had started with the plague, of course the Black Death) after this Italian trip with elephants and black slaves. He makes it romantic and intense in feeling, though all that feeling is nothing but the result of diabolical magic. Mephistopheles seduces the mother while Faust seduces Gretchen. Mephistopheles also keeps the brother away long enough for Faust to succeed in his seduction. But then Mephistopheles gets on his own route since Faust must be damned for him to recuperate his soul. He gets the brother back to the house in time to find the seducer in his sister's room, but after the mother had found him in the room too and had died of the traumatic shock. Faust kills the brother in the fight that follows. The sister will be then put in the blocks but not executed for fornication. But the winter comes and her baby is born. In the cold and the snow the baby will die of exposure. She will be accused of having killed the baby and then sentenced to burn at the stake. And here Murnau regenerates the tale by making Faust truly in love and coming back to see Gretchen again. He runs in the crowd to be on her passage when she is led to the stake. Mephistopheles makes him old again just when he stands in front of her begging for forgiveness. He is pushed away, unrecognized. She is tied to the stake and set afire. He jumps onto the pyre and into the fire and she sees through his age the young Faust she had been in love with. They die together at the stake. And that brings the final salvation because Faust was not moved by lust only but by real love that made him sacrifice his life, and Gretchen was also moved by love since she was able to recognize the young Faust in the old one, hence to see beyond appearances. The end then is the rejection of Mephistopheles' request to get Faust's soul by God's angel whose wings are wide open in the shape of an enormous heart. Apart from this touching and intense tale, the film is of course marvelously well directed and shot and Murnau chooses too to keep the old framing technique that was natural with the old camera, the picture is systematically fuzzy all around. Today this produces some kind of dreamlike feeling. The music of the DVD is also quite fascinating, in both versions of it, only a harp or a full symphonic orchestra. We must be more than plain grateful when we see all these old films that find a new youth and glory thanks to the DVD.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines", "The definitive \"Faust\" adaptation. The movie is full of iconic imagery, great expressionist scenes and great acting especially from G\u00f6sta Ekman as Faust and Emil Jannings as Mephisto himself. Camilla Horn also impresses in the female part. The giant wings of the Angel of Darkness embracing the city is a impressive unforgettable image. A very satisfying film.", "Mephisto (Satan) bets with God that he can get the soul of Faust, a bright and studious man. If Mephisto corrupts Faust, all mankind would belong to him. The first part of this film is related to this pact. Then, with Faust young and handsome, he seduces Gretchen, and the second part of this movie is related to the tragedy of Gretchen. The last scene, with the redemption of Faust, is also wonderful. Yesterday I watched Faust on DVD for the first time. This is another a masterpiece of the history of the cinematographic industry and of the German Expressionism. The lighting, shadows, effects and photography are amazing for a 1926 movie. I read in the biography of the outstanding Morneau that he fought as a pilot in the World War I and died in 1931, with 43 years old, in a car accident. What a loss for the culture of the world! Emil Jannings as Mephistoles is fantastic, alternating evil and wickedness with funny situations. Faust with his regret has a great performance and the despair of Gretchen (a very beautiful woman) is touching. I only regret that the DVD released in Brazil has not restored the images. My vote is ten.", "FW Murnau's 'Faust', made in Germany, is a wonderful film. The version I saw had a beautiful piano accompaniment, which certainly helped, but any musical accompaniment would do just as well.Emil Jannings' performance as Mephistopheles is just superb - mocking, playful, frightening. Camilla Horn and Wilhelm Dieterle (who later became a respected Hollywood film director) are also good value as the sister and brother who fall foul of the young Faust's amorality.The film is funny, moving, and effective. It looks stunning, it is like having a dream which assaults the senses at every turn. A true gem which I would recommend anyone to see.", "F.W. Murnau's \"Faust. Eine deutsche Volkssage\" (1926) is based on Goethe's \"Faust I\", the movie takes as direct text basis a libretto written by Hans Kyser which differs remarkably from Goethe's dramatic play. For example, Kyser motivates the physician Dr. Faustus's pact with Mephistopheles through his mercy for the victims of the plague, while in Goethe's work, the basic motivation of Dr. Faustus is the enlargement of his scientific knowledge. It is thus interesting to see that Mephisto or the devil represents the darkness from which all the additional knowledge seems to come which cannot be reached by Dr. Faustus in the world of the light in which God reigns. It is this negativity of the darkness as opposed to the positivity of the light that parallels the dichotomy of Good and Evil as well as the dichotomy of Volition and Cognition. So, Dr. Faustus' fundamental metaphysical attempt is to control the dark empire of the will that cannot be controlled by traditional science settled in the bright empire of the thought. It even seems that negativity stands for reflection, and reflection comes from the darkness that in the same time represents Evil. Moreover, since the Being is defined by the positivity of light, cognition and Good, the negativity of darkness, reflection and will must be defined by the Nothing, since in classical logic there is no third instance between them.Therefore, we may see Murnau's \"Faust\" not only as a movie dealing with the ethic categories of Good and Evil, but also with the metaphysical categories of Being and Nothing. Dr. Faustus, signing his league with the devil, opens the curtain that separates the Here and the Beyond, he transgresses a border of no return. When Mephisto promises Dr. Faustus that he may enter the contract \"only for one day\", it is quite clear why Mephisto can always turn around the hour-glass in order to prolong the lasting of the league: Eternity cannot be split; if you take out a piece of Eternity there will remain still Eternity. Since Dr. Faustus is a human being and hence does not participate in Eternity, it follows that he will not be able to stand in this never-land between the contextures of Good and Evil, of Darkness and Light, of Cognition and Volition, of Being and Nothing, of Here and Beyond. His intermediary position is shown by Murnau in the often overlooked scene where Dr. Faustus, who had meanwhile turned by aid of the devil into a young man, is charming a young Indian princess while a pendulum above them is vacillating between light and darkness.Murnau must have had in his mind a poly-contextural world when he shows us Mephisto holding the mirror in which the picture of the old Dr. Faustus appears, although he had already turned him into a youth. Not only does the mirror not reflect Mephisto who is holding it, but it reflects the picture of somebody else and even has a memory of the former state of this person. This phenomenon does not fit together at all with traditional logic in which the mirror can be seen as the operator who turns position into negation, falseness into truth and thus operates like a light-switch that, clicked on twice, leads back to the original state, i.e. from light via darkness back to light or from darkness via light back to darkness.Now, at the end of his life, Dr. Faustus stays in the borderland between light and darkness that cannot be shown at the hand of a light-switch, since this never stops in an intermediary position between light and darkness. Because the light-switch serves as a model for classical logic, we have to deal in Murnau's \"Faust\" with trans-classical logic and thus with a world in which there are not only the dichotomic contextures Here and Beyond, Being and Nothing, Cognition and Volition, but a never-land as a third instance between them, and thus we read on one of Gerhart Hauptmann's titles the phrase \"At the Gates of Darkness\", the gates representing this third instance between the dichotomic contextures of classical logic.When we read on another title toward the end of the movie \"Death sets all men free\", it is clear, that Dr. Faustus, after having entered the border-land between the Here and the Beyond by signing his pact with Mephisto, is on a trip that can only end in the Darkness, the Nothing and thus his Death. Once somebody has crossed the borderline between the contextures, he is on a trip of no-return. But such an end would fit into classical logic and thus not fit together with all the hints Murnau gives us toward polycontexturality. Murnau therefore needs a third instance between the contextures by which Dr. Faustus can be rescued from Death representing Evil in two-valued classical logic, both belonging to the contexture of the Nothing. Since Evil can only be neutralized by Good, this third instance must come from Good in order to finish Dr. Faustus's life not in the darkness of Evil, but in the light of Good, and this instance is his love to Gretchen. But in order to achieve that, Murnau needs another trick that does not fit into classical logic: Since Dr. Faustus has meanwhile turned back into the old man he was at the beginning of the movie, Gretchen must remember the alter ego of Dr. Faustus as a youngster, and Murnau shows this by fading over the pictures of the two alter egos of Dr. Faustus. In other words: Murnau achieves to establish Love as a third instance between the contextures of Good and Evil by doubling Dr. Faustus' individuality using paradoxically the dichotomic means of classical logic. When Dr. Faustus and Gretchens die together at the stake, they have finished their trip in to the light that leads them out of darkness: \"Death sets all men free\".", "\"Nosferatu\" was going to be a hard act for F.W. Murnau to follow, but he came pretty close with \"Faust - Eine deutsche Volkssage\" (simply called \"Faust\" in English). The movie combines traditional stories of Faust with Goethe's version of the story about a man who sells his soul to the Devil. Like \"Nosferatu\", the movie has a very surreal look: it's as though almost the entire story takes place in the foggy moors, which of course adds to the mystique.I should admit that a lot of the movie caused me to make the sorts of comments like on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", due to how full of itself the movie is. In addition, there was a scene that made my jaw drop: the people carrying the bodies of plague victims were dressed like the Ku Klux Klan! Yes, the movie has its strengths and weaknesses, but it is definitely one that I recommend. One of the really great films from inter-war Germany, along with \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", \"Nosferatu\", \"The Nibelungenlied\" and \"M\" (and there are probably plenty that I haven't seen).Starring G\u00f6sta Ekman, Emil Jannings, Camilla Horn, Frida Richard, William Dieterle, Yvette Guilbert, Eric Barclay, Hanna Ralph and Werner Fuetterer,", "Directed by F.W.Murnau, this expressionist film is a classic. For this film, the original tale immortalized by Goethe has been slightly modified, but it works quite well. Murnau skilfully directed the film, laden with shadows and games of light, which gives it a certain elegance, accentuated by the fuzzy and indistinct costumes and scenery. With regard to this more technical point, the scenes between the Angel and the Demon, as well as the scene in which Faust invokes the forces of evil are particularly remarkable, having used the best visual effects of his time. In the case of a silent film, music is important and works very well, matching perfectly with what we see on the screen.Throughout the film there is a tense atmosphere, where the characters achieve a pleasant dramatic depth, especially Marguerite, which is played very well by Camilla Horn, who almost makes her a martyr to the nefarious action of evil. Faust, as it should be, is guilty of his vanity, but, note, he uses the forces of evil often for the benefit of others and not of himself. He is the center of the story and G\u00f6sta Ekmann, the actor who gave him life, knew perfectly how to capture the essence of the character. But even better than all of them is Emil Jannings, who gave life to Mephistopheles, the great tempter laden with malice and cunning. Probably one of this actor's best performances.Despite being a little forgotten, like almost all films from the period of silence, this film has quality and deserves to be revisited by new audiences today.", "The demon Mephisto (Emil Jannings) wagers with God that he can corrupt a mortal man's soul.Apparently, director F.W. Murnau wanted Lillian Gish to play Gretchen, but she insisted that the film be shot by her favorite cinematographer, Charles Rosher. Murnau instead cast newcomer Camilla Horn, whom he had met on the set of \"Tartuffe\" (1925), where she was a double for Lil Dagover. Now, I would much rather have seen Gish or Dagover in this role, but Horn holds her own and makes a mark on German film history.The imagery is what sells this film: from the beginning with the creepy four horsemen, to Mephisto unleashing the plague, and beyond. The story is a classic (I mean, this is Goethe we are talking about) but it is even more classic because of the way Murnau was able to present it in 1926, a time when special effects were in their infancy.The only unfortunate this is that Karl Freund had to drop out, as this would have been yet one more classic film to put on his resume.", "When I mentioned that the movie isn't especially close to the novel by Goethe, this ISN'T that bad a problem. Unfortunately for me, as a college student decades ago I was forced to read this epic story and it was tedious to say the least. It was 25,000 of non-rhyming verse that went on and on and on and on,....seemingly with no end! Fortunately, this movie is relatively fast paced and interesting--probably because it DOESN'T follow the original!! Now the plot is possibly familiar to you. Faust is offered a deal by the devil--he can have youth and beauty and live out his every wish provided he give up his soul. The prologue to this involving the archangel debating with Satan is GREAT--the make up and costumes are amazing! Faust agrees and lives like a jerk--eventually getting a sweet young lady, Gretchen, pregnant and leaving her. However, like the novel, in the end Faust has second thoughts about what he's become.The star of this movie are the special effects and costuming as well as the gorgeous cinematography. For all fans of the silents, this is a must-see.", "For me, along with Metropolis, The Gold Rush and The Passion of Joan of Arc, this is one of the finest movies of the 1920s. In design and direction especially, Faust is a masterpiece. It has a great story with a strong operatic feel, and the characters are great, Mephistopheles is especially memorable.F.W.Murnau's direction is superb. This is especially true in the duel between Faust and Mephistopheles which defines the term epic in every sense, and part of the reasons why it works so well is the wonderfully malevolent atmosphere that Murnau, Robert Herlth and Walter Rohrig create. The music fits amazingly well and the story despite one or two scenes in the middle that drag just a tad is compelling.The acting is very good. Gosta Ekman does a fine job conveying his character complete with a believable transformation from decrepitude to youth, while Camilla Horn is suitably pure. As the imposing demon Mephistopheles, Emil Jannings with a magnetic appearance and presence steals the film, while he does keep some of his comedic qualities there are times where he is quite terrifying.Other than Jannings' performance and Murnau's direction, what makes Faust such a masterpiece are the expressionistic images which inspired by Casper David Frederich's paintings are amazing, with excellent cinematography and sculptures of smoke, light and steam to compliment them. All in all, a brilliant film and one of the best of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox"], "tt0017048": ["This is actually one of the titles of the film, a page out of order. It perfectly reflects the film itself, a narrative fractured, demented, cast in and out of a feverish mind, but ultimately incomplete to us, and the various misconceptions it has spawned in trying to evaluate as though it was the whole thing.I was increasingly suspicious of this while watching, that I was basically confronted with an incomplete film and so a film impenetrable not wholly by design but only because the keys have been lost to us, or are not attached to the film we are watching and we have to apprehend elsewhere. Doing a little research afterwards only confirmed my doubts. So a little context:-the film is not the tip of the iceberg of an advanced cinema whose main body is lamentably lost to us; it was saved exactly because it was an exception, a low-budget oddity the filmmaker himself re-discovered in his garden shed. The majority of silent Japanese cinema - whose final traces were eclipsed in the aftermath of WWII - were generic studio reworkings of popular material.-it is not the product of an 'isolated cinematic environment free of influence', rather a studied attempt to recreate what the French avant-garde was pioneering at the time; so yes, the superimpositions, the haze of motions and details, the rapid-fire montage, all of them tools in the attempt to offer us a glimpse of the fractured, elusive reality of the mind, available tools at the time that Kinugasa knew from other films.-so even though the idea of a janitor coming to work in a mental hospital may carry hues of Caligari, the film itself is from the line of what in France was called impressionism; the films of Epstein, L'Herbier, Gance.-most importantly, even though the closest parable I can think of is Menilmontant, another French film from the same year that in place of story tried to paint with only images a state of mind from inside the mirror, that film was directly structured around images. It was intended to be seen as we have it. Watching Page it becomes increasingly obvious that a story deeply pertains to what we see; as was customary in Japan at the time, that story was meant to be narrated to the audience by a benshi, a narrator supplied by each theater. We may cobble together a view of that story from other sources, but the intended effect is lost to us.-there is still the problem that in the version we have approximately one third of the film is missing. Most of it in the end from what I can tell, where the girl is supposed to marry her fianc\u00e9 (which echoes and wonderfully annotates the scene where the janitor imagines himself reunited with his wife.Oh, what we have of the film is more than fine, it's actually one of the most captivating visions of the mind in disarray from the time. But it was just not meant to be seen as merely a tone poem. The dreamy flow is clearly flowing somewhere. What we have instead is only what was salvaged from it but at the same time near complete enough, making barely enough sense to stand on its own, that we may be inclined to accept as the full vision.We can still accept this itself as a fragment of madness and interpret from where our imagination takes us. That is fine, I encourage this.Rumors have been circulating about a new restored version, hopefully one that - next to a better print - somehow includes the narration, preferably by a benshi, or intertitles at the very least. Until then, no rating from me.", "Very few Japanese films exist from the silent period. In fact, statistics show that only 1% of around 7,000 productions are represented in the a catalogue of the silent cycle. Director Teinosuke Kinugasa's Kurutta Ippeji (also known as A Page of Madness) was thought lost (and perhaps forgotten) until he himself discovered a print in a warehouse in 1971. He diligently produced a new music soundtrack and re-released it. This is the first example of a silent film from Japan, and have to say that the world should be thankful that Kinugasa discovered this avant- garde little master work.The film was produced with an avant garde group of artists, known as Shinkankak-ha (School of New Perceptions), an experimental art movement that rejected naturalism, or realism, and was highly influenced by European art movements such as Expressionism, Dada, and Cubism, and evidently uses the techniques found in Soviet Montage, particularly Sergei Eisenstein - fundamentally, as this project deals with madness, it would be easy to draw parallels with Robert Weine's seminal horror film Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (1920). What the art trope bring to this extreme nightmare are those exaggerated, pointed and alarmist movements like the expressionist acting styles being used in European film and stage work - but happens to find its own stylistic flourishes, and colloquial \"voice\" (for want of a better word).Kurutta ippeji's simplistic story focuses on a man (Masuo Inoue) whom has taken a job as a janitor in an asylum, so that he may be close to his wife (Yoshie Nakagawa), who has been condemned. His aim is to aid in her escape from the dogmatic institution. However, when the break-out is orchestrated, her madness has enveloped her, and she is unwilling to leave with her husband. The couples daughter (Ayako Iijima) visits the asylum to advise her mother of her engagement, which leads to a maelstrom of fantastically abstract flashbacks, giving light to the reasons the mother is condemned.The films style is so incredibly complex and technically brilliant. In the opening sequence, the jarring compositions (both beautiful and haunting), superimposition's, and quick montage editing, creates an assault on the senses that is difficult to break away from - torrential rain falls the scenery in shots of the asylum, expressionist compositions of wind-battered tree branches clashing with windows, and the sight of a woman riddled in madness. The use of superimposition becomes greater as the film moves into crescendo, and these layers portray climatically the merger of madness and modernity. Do we witness the ghosts that haunt the corridors of the asylum? Or are these the devastating spectre's of modernity, and the destruction of tradition? An ironic speculation perhaps, considering the mechanics of cinema production and exhibition.To a modern audience, silent cinema is often a difficult watch. This film is of particular note for this argument. Kurutta ippeji has no title cards describing dialogue, or internal action, which makes it difficult to follow at times. But as with all 1920's Japanese cinema, the films were always accompanied by narration - a storyteller known colloquially as a benshi. But this small infraction does not hamper an incredibly dazzling piece of early experimental cinema, and one that should be viewed by any film enthusiast, at least for posterity - if not for a formative education on the stylistic diversity of film as art.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com", "An old man works as a janitor in a mental hospital to be close to his wife who is a patient there and to try to get her out.This is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and an oddity in the history of Japanese cinema. Long thought lost, a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack added to it, which fits perfectly with the images. It might have been influenced by cabinet of doctor Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed he never saw the German film). However it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing (and chilly) portray of the inner mental state of the inmates in the asylum. To achieve this, the film makes use of every single film technique available at the time: multiple exposures and out of focus subjective point of view, tilted camera angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist lighting and superimpositions among others. It is also a very complicated film to follow, as it has not got intertitles.The film opens with a montage of shots of rain hitting the windows of the hospital, wind shaking trees and of thunder. The unsettling weather metaphors the mental condition of the patients and introduces one of the them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as the music that incites the dancer to get into a frantic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence involving the same patient engaged in another frenzied dance, she is being watched by other inmates. Multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patients' point of view and their confused \"view\" of the world.These are just two examples from this amazing film trying to represent the patients' subconscious and view of the \"sane\" world.In three words A MUST SEE.", "Who knew that Japanese directors made weird films even in the 1920s? A Page of Madness is an expressionistic, surrealist silent film monstrosity from director Teinosuke Kinugasa, who had little to no budget at the time, so his stars had to help paint the sets, push the dolly and make props. They even slept on the set or in the front office because Kinugasa couldn't afford accommodations for them. After being lost for about 50 years, it was re-discovered by Kinugasa in his shed in 1971. However, 20 minutes were missing and the film is now incomplete. At the time of its release, it was screened only in cinemas that specialized in showing foreign films and gained mass popularity.The movie is co-written by and adapted from a short story by Yasunari Kawabata, the first Japanese man to win a Nobel Prize for literature (in 1968). It's roughly about a man getting a job as a janitor in an asylum hoping to free his imprisoned wife. There are, of course, other characters, but the plot is completely incomprehensible, not only because of the lack of intertitles (Japanese silent films were narrated by actors called benshi), a large amount of unsignalled flashbacks and weird hallucinatory scenes, but also because the movie is kinda distracting in the sense that you never get the chance to quite sink in. Hard to explain.The soundtrack is quite interesting, sometimes composed solely of mechanical sounds while we watch dissolving images of people, lights and machines. It's a one-of-a-kind film, especially for the time, but it guarantees no emtional attachment whatsoever because it's impossible to deduce what the hell is going on. So, I definitely didn't enjoy it. It's both interesting and boring. Strange, but that sentence best explains it.", "Film history has been negligent in recognizing this landmark silent drama, made in 1926 by pioneering Japanese director Teinosuke Kinugasa, but unknown until 1971, when a surviving print was (literally) unearthed in the director's garden shed. The film was produced in an isolated creative environment far removed from any foreign influence, but is nevertheless a masterpiece of imagery and editing, revealing a stunning visual flair and employing montage techniques as skillfully as anyone since Eisenstein. It tells a powerful, hallucinatory story of a janitor in an insane asylum who wants desperately to help his inmate wife after she attempts suicide, and like Murnau's 'The Last Laugh' unfolds without the crutch of intertitles. The film has aged remarkable little after the better part of a century in limbo, but since its belated rediscovery has yet to earn the acclaim and evaluation it deserves.", "Kurutta ipp\u00eaji (1926)*** (out of 4)Bizarre Japanese horror film has a man taking a janitor job at an asylum so that he can be closer to his wife who was committed after trying to kill their child. Had Luis Bunuel been bore in Japan and started making movies in 1926 then I'm guessing the final product would have came out looking like this thing. Lost for decades, it's easy to see why this film was never discovered but now that it's making its way around, it seems like this is destined to become something of a cult favorite to silent and horror fans. There's no straight story being told here, instead it's more avant-garde as we get all sorts of surreal images. We get the basic story but everything else is either told in flashback or through extra fast editing that helps build up the insanity of the lead character. Director Teinosuke Kinugasa really wants to get inside the mind of the insane and I think he does a pretty good job with it. At just 59-minutes the film moves at a pretty fast rate and a lot of this can be credited to the editing. I thought that the editing was the real star of the movie as it's done in such a fashion that you often see something but then you question what it was that you actually saw. You also have to try and keep up with what's going on and everything is happening so fast that you can see that the director was trying to use this to make the viewer feel what the characters were feeling being the asylum walls. There aren't any intertitles, which just adds to the visual image and the music score (done in the 70s) fits the film very well.", "With rapid intercutting of scenes of insane people in an asylum, and montage/superimposition of images, and vague, interwoven narratives, this is a very hard movie to follow. Apparently a man (Masue Inoue) takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife, and maybe to rescue her. But she's clearly mad, huddled on the floor, with a vacant expression much of the time and fear, misery, and confusion written on her face the rest of the time. The film-maker switches to her point of view sometimes, and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby, or clutching at a drowned child. She's tormented by something. When the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks, the filmmaker uses distorting lenses and such things, showing us what mad people see and then how they react. And the place is swarming with mad folks, laughing, hiding, and in one case dancing frenetically night and day. At one point the man tries to take his wife outside, but the night outside the door terrifies her and she runs back to her cell. Gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away, and he kills the doctor and many attendants, and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud. When he wakes he is relieved, and mops the floor. Some fascinating shots of Japanes life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.", "Silent film about a husband deeply tormented by his actions towards his wife (domestic abuse that caused her to go mad) is a knockout. Directed by Kinugasa in a hallucinogenic, surreal style, the visually odd nature of the film depicts (or we are led to believe) an insane asylum housing the mentally unwell wife with her husband (sorrowful for what he did to her) taking a menial job at the place to be near her. The way the mad in the asylum are filmed, the director applies a narrative without titles to tell us what is going on, instead opting for us to determine that for ourselves. Overlapping images, stark use of black and white lensing, radically challenging angled depictions of the patients, and alternating trips into the real and unreal depending on where the protagonist's head is at, the idea of rescuing his wife from the asylum that is now her home becomes bleaker as the film continues. The insane damned to spend their lives in a place that serves as a type of prison are often deliriously photographed in a barrage of startlingly bleak images and its an experimental avante garde style, often quite unsettling and tragic. Unforgettable is the film's presentation. This will be certain to leave many viewers frustrated and the nature of its storytelling is difficult...just to kind of give you a head's up.", "If you decide to watch this film, read through the summary on IMDb first. While this summary does help to explain what you're seeing (and you DO need this), it also praises the film for not relying on intertitle cards. I totally disagree...a few would have helped explain the action, as without the summary much of it just wouldn't make sense. As it is, the film ALREADY is confusing and strange.The style of \"A Page of Madness\" is uniquely strange. It's a Japanese silent film which reminds me a bit of the German Expressionist film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\"--but not nearly so strange and stylized. Instead, the film relies on fast intercutting of symbols and shapes to provide the odd style for the movie. It also is a bit reminiscent of the American horror film \"Freaks\" as it tries to evoke a strong reaction in the viewer as they're exposed to insane folks WILDLY overacting and overdoing the whole crazy bit. To me, it makes for an oddly interesting art film but not much more. It's certainly NOT a film to appeal to mass audiences as they wouldn't sit still for such a vague and bizarro film.As for the plot, I'll have to assume the one on IMDb is correct. I couldn't exactly tell what was happening but the summary did make the film make sense.", "If you do not think you can take graphic scenes of mentally unstable people, this film is not for you.This story is about a man who takes a job at a local mental institution so he can be near his wife, who has gone mad. Throughout this long thought lost film you see clearly harrowing images of people at the institution. The soundtrack only adds to the foreboding. There are people lying catatonic and there is a dancer who doesn't stop dancing until she drops to the floor, exhausted. The film is 59 minutes long, I think it was originally longer but this was all that was found. There are no inter titles, its a silent film. In Japan, I am certain the benshi narrated the story in theaters, but your imagination has to follow this story. So, why a 7? It is daring, unflinching, brave and both ugly and not at the same time. As a point of reference only, Guy Maddin's work approaches this. Just know going in there is no happiness here. You won't soon forget this film. Best idea: Don't watch it before bedtime, it will stay with you.", "I saw the 1 hour version shown on TCM. I'll like to see the 78 minute restoration as this version has no inter titles, no translation of signs and missing a third of the film. Now, back then a benshi would live narrate so there wouldn't be titles but do they have a copy of what the benshi said during the film (if anything)? I would read a synopsis before watching as it makes things clearer. The plot is hard to follow, some of it is from the POV of crazy people or the dream of the protagonist. Well worth watching but more for admiration than enjoyment.", "This very strange movie is unlike anything made in the west at the time. With its tumultuous emotions and net of visions, dreams, and startling images, its effect is both beautiful and unsettling.  The actors are choreographed more like dance than acting.  It contains the only dream sequence I know of that actually resembles a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).", "...until, of course, you've seen it, at which point it instantly vaults to the first rank of silents along with Greed, The Crowd, Man With a Movie Camera, Nosferatu, and so forth. I don't want to give away too much--a great deal of pleasure will be derived from a 'cold' viewing of A Page of Madness--but let's just say it's one of the most radical films of the 1920s. So far ahead of its time that it remains revelatory and utterly contemporary eighty years on, it anticipates much of twentieth century avant garde and experimental cinema whilst also managing to tell a story that is completely captivating. Director Teinosuke Kinugasa is best known for his 1953 drama Gate of Hell, but his lengthy hundred-film plus resume extends back to the early '30s and surely harbors some other gems. Presumably and sadly, most of them are probably lost--if I'm wrong, someone please point me towards more!", "A Page of Madness is an expressionistic Japanese film that has not gotten the attention it deserves. I was introduced to the film through the fifteen part documentary series The Story of Film an Odyssey. Fortunately, a friend had dubbed the silent film off of Turner Classic Movies during one of its infrequent showings.The clip in The Story of a Film an Odyssey looked like some mad movie genius had crossed the set designs from a German expressionist film with the fast edits of a classic Russian work. This clip was from the attention grabbing opening of A Page of Madness. A janitor wanders an insane asylum at night during a storm. The storm has a strange effect on the patients and, presumably, the attendant. The edits are fast, conveying mystery and terror like in a horror film. This sequence (and a sequence at the climax) is nothing short of brilliance.From here the film turns to a narrative, although an oblique one. This clerk or janitor seems to have an unhealthy fixation on one of the female patients. . . and more of one for this patient's daughter. The janitor clearly knew this family before the mother was committed. IMDb says that the woman is the janitor's wife. I am not doubting this, but the film is not clear on this point. What is clear is that the janitor is suffering from a lack of love. This janitor is not the only one. One patient is compelled to dance suggestively and nearly starts a riot. By contrast, the doctors appear clinical and ineffectual. As the film goes along, the protagonist's mental state seems to wane.Much about the plot is unclear. Many Japanese silent were narrated by a spokesman in the theater. This may have been the case with A Page of Madness; thus, some of the ambiguity would have been explained by the live narrator. I prefer to think the ambiguity was deliberate and never explained. The film has a wonderful sense of mystery to it. I don't want any more of an explanation. I (and probably most film fans) watch a lot of movies that are merely fair. These films are watchable, but they do not stay in one's memory. That is why A Page of Madness is so stunning. It kicks the door down and announces itself to the world. I feel less like a reviewer than a herald for a lost classic. Are you listening Criterion?", "It's easy to make really general comments about a film like this. The fact that it's one of the only remaining Japanese films from this era causes people to say that it \"started Japanese cinema\" and was \"unlike anything the west ever made.\" The latter of these two comments is particularly false as Kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off \"Caligari\" on more than one occasion. But style was meant to be imitated, and doesn't take away from this film's importance. What we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles, opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities. For this purpose, the madhouse is the ideal setting, and the writers knew this. This is a landmark film, and every effort should be made to track it down.5 out of 5 - Essential", "The story is admittedly hard to follow. There are no intertitles and it would have originally been narrated by a benshi. But the relative lack of narrative (and don't get me wrong, there is a discernible plot) only adds to the unsettling, off-kilter nature of the film. It's one of the most dizzying, delirious depictions of insanity I've seen, with haunting and bizarre imagery around every corner, an almost complete breakdown of the wall between subjective and objective reality... and a reminder that, in a way, all cinema is a form of madness. The variety and level of technique on display is not only impressive, but used appropriately. The avant-garde 1971 score makes for brilliant accompaniment as well. It's an exhilarating piece of work, both despite and because of its incompleteness.", "I saw this for the first time few days back.\nIt is about a man who lands himself into a mental asylum so that he can be near his wife who is an inmate cos of his past cruelty. The man, feeling guilty, had taken a job of a janitor at the asylum to take care of her.\nWhile inside among patients, the janitor slowly loses control of the border between dreams and reality.\nThe film is very confusing due to the lack of intertitles n of course the weirdness which is present in most Japaness films makes it a confusing n surrealistic film.\nThe asylum in the countryside, the torrential rainstorm, the weird dance sequence, the isolation n the daydreams were intriguing n eerie.", "I saw \"A Page of Madness\" in a silent film course at Wesleyan University and it haunts me still after 25 years. Truly ahead of its time - perhaps even still - this gem of a film reveals both the frightening and attractive aspects of madness.", "Where does one begin with this extraordinary piece? Despite missing two reels and lacking both intertitles and the customary narration that would accompany Japanese films at that time, it succeeds thanks to its mesmerising images and the realistic performances that Teinosuke Kinugasa has drawn from his cast.To say that Kinugasa was experiencing financial troubles would be an understatement but his budgetary limitations have been overcome by sheer inventiveness. He has been aided immeasurably by his actors, many of whom painted the sets, made props and slept on the floor. Apparently his leading actor Masuo Inoue, waived his fee.Legend has it that the director unearthed a copy in 1971 but in reality there were three more copies in existence. That of course does not detract from his achievement here which is to manipulate past and present, reality and hallucination by using rhythmic montage, flashbacks, distortion and superimposition. Kinugasa could not have been unaware of Eisenstein whilst the influence of Wiene and Murnau is also evident.All is confusion here and continual movement in the form of rioting by the inmates and Eiko Minani's perpetual dance. In the midst of this lunacy we have the stillness of the marvellous Inouie as an ex-naval officer who has taken a job as a janitor in an asylum in order to be near his deranged wife. This extremely harrowing and difficult role is played by Yoshie Nakagawa and the scene where she shrinks away from the open door to the outside world lingers long in the memory.Other unforgettable scenes are those where the janitor is offered a brief respite by winning a prize at the fair and the wearing of the smiling Noh masks which is Kinugasa's final masterstroke.The lasting impact of this film lies not just in the techniques involved in the making of it but in its stark reminder to us all that the mind is a delicate, finely-balanced instrument that can so easily be damaged.", "It looks like an art film made today, with filters to make it look old. It is a surrealistic, expressionistic nightmare. Simply amazing! A masterpiece. Compared to most silent movies from the West, this Japanese silent film looks ahead of its time, \"modern\". I will definitely watch more silent movies made in Japan.", "Most of the film takes place in an asylum. We focus on patients who do repetitive act, losing their connection with reality. We also see a kind of tribalism that gut wrenching. A man who has made the mistake of sending his wife to this asylum decides he needs to get her out. If her mind was not gone when she came in, it has been severely damaged while she has been incarcerated. Not a film for everyone. Unique in its surrealism for Japan in 1926. Claustrophobic, to say the least.", "I've heard some Japanese silents had a narrator live in the cinema to detail what was happening. But without it, and without intertitles, this film is nigh on unwatchable. The story is impossible to follow. As it stands, it feels not like a story, but a visual art project, in the vain of 'Un Chien Andalou'. To that extent there are a few striking images, with the noir lighting being a highlight, but it is very repetitious. All we see are the same images of women in cells going crazy, and a calm man gazing between the bars. I've read the director had little money while making the film, and it shows, for the same sets are repeated over and over. There really isn't enough material here to warrant a feature length film, and the true madness of the film is that they tried to stretch it so long. 10 or 20 minutes would have been far more suitable.", "...from director Teinosuke Kinugasa. A man (Masuo Inoue) works as a janitor at a mental asylum in order to be near his wife (Yoshie Nakagawa), who is a patient. The man's daughter (Ayako Iijima) is to be married soon, and questions of attendance are making things difficult for the man.This meager narrative provides the framework for a lot of flash-cut editing, strobing visual tricks, and experimental cinema. This isn't interesting as a traditional story (at least, not the existing version, which is said to be missing nearly a third of its original footage), but rather in depicting madness and inner turmoil in a visual fashion. Even the usual silent film intertitles are absent, rendering the film a purely visual experience. The score that was used on the version I watched seemed like it was suited for a late 1960s acid party. The original release was said to have had a narrator and traditional Japanese music accompaniment. What I saw was still an interesting viewing, much of it closer to experimental films from the 1960s than what I'm used to seeing from the 1920s.", "Kurutta Ippeji offers a view on the distorted perspective of a troubled janitor in a mental asylum. As a proof of concept, it shows that experimental cinematic techniques can affect the way narration is perceived by the viewer - here, the visual elements contribute to how the viewer experiences the characters' mental state. As an experiment, the movie possibly even makes a stronger case than the comparably surreal Hausu (1977), which is partly imbalanced in its style. However, due to the poor visual quality and the lack of functional storytelling, this experimental feature can't be easily recommended to people looking for a more conventional feature.\nOverall 7/10\nFull Review on movie-discouse.blogspot.com", "I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my Japenese film class, but this film really blew me away. The director does a wonderful job following through with the title of his film, truly portraying a picture of madness. I think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind. This film just added to my feelings about foreign silent films vs. American, in that the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and make you think rather than going for the fluffy film always with the happy ending, exercising the imagination very little."], "tt0017049": [], "tt0017103": ["Until a few months ago, when Michael Elliott added it to his list of films watched to be exact, I was under the impression that this was a lost title \u0096 a view which was certainly true till the late 70s since Carlos Clarens, in his wonderful 1967 \"Horror Movies\" book, called it \"probably the most elusive of lost movies\" and even Leslie Halliwell, in the 1977 edition of his famous \"Film Guide\", gives it as unavailable for reappraisal! Indeed, virtually the only way I had previously known this film was via one intriguing still of the Hades sequence found in the section devoted to director Rex Ingram in the periodical \"The Movies\" (published in the early 80s)\u0085so, it's great that THE MAGICIAN has eventually seen the light of day (albeit unofficially) and, thankfully, it lives up to its considerable reputation \u0096 to my eyes, at least.Ingram was one of Silent cinema's master visual stylists but is now a forgotten figure best-known for the Rudolph Valentino version of THE FOUR HORSEMAN OF THE APOCALYSE (1921); his retirement from films once Talkies came in suggests that, like D.W. Griffith, he was unable to adapt to the ongoing progress in cinematic technique and, indeed, his films \u0096 like Griffith's \u0096 have an inherently stilted quality to them which dates his output more than those of contemporary auteurs! Anyway, this was my fourth Ingram movie after the interesting THE CONQUERING POWER (1921), the fine if somewhat underwhelming THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (1922) and the rousing SCARAMOUCHE (1923); unfortunately, my copy of MARE NOSTRUM (1926) \u0096 recorded off TCM UK \u0096 got erased by accident before I had the opportunity to watch it. Alice Terry, Ingram's wife, appeared in 15 of his films and here plays the distressed virginal heroine \u0096 who's the prime ingredient for the experiment concocted by the magician of the title (Paul Wegener). The latter, best-known for his three \"Golem\" pictures made at the height of the \"German Expressionist\" movement, makes for an overwhelmingly menacing villain \u0096 although I found his being a medical student quite amusing (Wegener was 52 at the time of filming!). By the way, the character of Oliver Haddo was based by novelist W. Somerset Maugham on notorious English Occultist and writer Aleister Crowley! The film, an MGM production but shot in France (where Ingram lived), is ostensibly a variation on the Frankenstein myth with a few Svengali overtones thrown in for good measure; interestingly, Paul Wegener would star in an official version of that one in Germany the following year. Ingram's assistant director was the future iconoclastic English film-maker, Michael Powell, who also appears unbilled in a snake-charming sequence around the middle of the film! As expected, the film is pictorially quite stylish (shot by frequent Rex Ingram, Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder lenser, John F. Seitz), especially in the fantasy sequence set in Hades \u0096 which must surely have left an indelible impression on Ingram's production manager here, Harry Lachman, to refer back to it when he came to direct the Spencer Tracy version of DANTE'S INFERNO (1935) \u0096 and the finale set in a laboratory on a remote mountaintop, which uncannily prefigures (literally step by step) the similar climax at the end of James Whale's BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935)!; as a matter of fact, Wegener even has a dwarfish assistant a' la Dwight Frye in Whale's FRANKENSTEIN (1931) \u0096 so, it's very possible that Whale had seen Ingram's film.One is all the more grateful, then, that a print of THE MAGICIAN has survived since it helps throw more light on the influences behind the greatest horror film ever made (which also happens to be my all-time favorite film)", "Beautiful Margaret Dauncey (Alice Terry) is set to marry young handsome Dr. Arthur Burdon (Ivan Petrovich). They meet an evil magician named Oliver Haddo (Paul Wegener) who is trying to create life. He needs the blood of someone whose profile fits Margaret's perfectly...and he'll so ANYTHING to get it.Hard to see silent. I want to thank TCM for showing it about a week ago. The print was in pretty good shape with tinting and an amusing music score (LOVED when they used \"Night on Bald Mountain\"). The movie was made with a pretty big budget--the settings are incredible--and has a good script that follows many horror film clich\u00e9s--but in a good way. Heck, it all ends on a dark and stormy night and in a CASTLE! Also there's a trip to Hell which is a real jaw dropper. The acting varies. Terry was a star of the silent screen and it's easy to see why. She was a beautiful woman AND a good actress. She's just great here. Wegener chews the scenery again and again and AGAIN as the mad magician. He really overdoes it--but it's pretty amusing. Petrovich is given nothing to do as the doctor but him and Terry make a very good-looking couple. Beautifully directed by Rex Ingram too (who was Terry's husband). Well worth seeing--if you can.", "Its all here in embryo: the paradigm for Frankenstein. The mad scientist, trying to create life in his laboratory located in a forbidden tower on the top of a rocky mountain, while thunder and lightning terrify the superstitious villagers. Supposedly adapted from a W. Somerset Maugham novel, the possibility exists that it was Maugham (a qualified physician) who, still very much on the make for an overwhelming success in his third book, might have cribbed more than a little bit from Mary Shelly. However, instead of the Romantic Prometheus, driven mad by hubris and symbolic of mankind's desire to harness newfangled science to dominate and conquer nature, despite the warnings of terrible consequences, all taking place on the edge of the Industrial revolution, we have the elements shaped into a Victorian melodrama of the villain-continued-to-pursue-her variety complete with virgin's blood and a heroine tied in artful knots, and a villain motivated by nothing more than criminal insanity.On the other hand the artful visual qualities of the storytelling is something that has been lost in today's film vocabulary. A zippy 80 minutes or so, today the coarse need for thrills from this type of film would have necessitated a number anatomically gruesome murders before the final heroine jeopardy and heroic rescue. Here a little horror goes a very long way (all the way to the French Riviera, in fact). THE MAGICIAN is everything that made the silent film, at the same time, so great and so very silly. By the way, shots of Paris, virtually traffic free are a revelation, as are shots of a cobblestone village high up in the mountains (the Alps Maritimes) behind the Riviera. And yes, that's the same Paul Wegener who directed and starred in two versions of The Golom as well as playing Svengali in a 1927 version of the Du Maurier story.", "This is a very good silent film that still hold up very well today. When the film begins, Margaret (Alice Terry) is terribly injured--so badly she's paralyzed. However, Dr. Burdon (Iv\u00e1n Petrovich) performs surgery on her and she is healed. They soon fall in love and life looks grand. However, Oliver Haddo (Paul Wegener) sees her and instantly is smitten with her. Using his evil magical powers, he's able to pull her to him despite he loving the Doctor. However, he's not taking her because he loves her...nope. He's planning on using her for a human sacrifice in order to act like a Dr. Frankenstein and prove he can raise the dead!! Can Dr. Burdon rescue his love before it's too late?This is a good film...very tense and exciting. Wegener (the German actor who starred in \"The Golem\") was excellent as the powerful madman and the film, though melodramatic, avoids going overboard like some films of the era thanks to good direction by Rex Ingram....Terry's real life husband.", "Rex Ingram is probably best remembered for directing Rudolph Valentino's breakthrough film THE FOUIR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE (1921) but he ventured into the fledgling terror genre with this thriller starring Paul (The Golem) Wegener.Wegener's character, Dr. Oliver Haddo, is allegedly based on the real life character Alastair Crowley. When we first meet him he is in attendance as the famous Dr. Burdon (Ivan Petrovich) saves the life of lovely Margaret Dauncey (Alice Terry, the real life Mrs. Ingram) with an operation on her spine. While recovering, Margaret falls in love with Dr. Burdon and he returns her affections. Dr. Haddo is interested in her too but for far less healthy reasons. Dr. H you see, has been searching for the way to create artificial life in the laboratory (sound familiar?) and a old book on alchemy has informed him that he needs \"the heart blood of a maiden\" added to certain other chemicals to make this happen.So determined is Haddo to make this happen that he hypnotises Margaret and marries her while she is under his spell. At his mountain top lab he plans to complete his diabolical experiment. Will Margaret lose her own life so Haddo can create life? Will Dr. Burdon find her in time? Ah . . . that would be telling!What many of us wonder is, is Haddo a real magician or just a very good hypnotist? In one scene he allows a poisonous snake to bite him but makes the lethal wound vanish with just a wave of his hand. Just a moment later the same snake bites a young woman and she must be rushed to hospital. Now most of us know that a venomous snake expels all its venom at the first bite so the fact that it was the second bite that felled the woman should have been a tipoff that Haddo was not bitten at all. Yes, but remember this is a movie and we have to build up suspense. An amusing scene has Dr. Burdon and Dr. Haddo meeting for the first time in a park. As Haddo walks away Burdon remarks to Margaret \"He looks like he stepped out of a melodrama!\". As if on cue Haddo glares back, throws his cape over his shoulder and makes a perfect stage exit! It is an innocuous but effective moment and briefly clouds the menace that will soon be facing the lovers.The sequence most people remember is where Haddo gives Margaret a look at Hell. It is a rugged looking place but rather removed from the horrors of the Italian film L'INFERNO (1909) or even DANTE'S INFERNO (1926). The place is loaded with damned souls but they all dance around carefree while Pan (at least I think it's Pan) plays a tune on his pipes. Another faun (dancer Hubert Stowitts) takes Margaret in his arms and passionately kisses her as the dream ends. So did they really go to Hell or was it all a hypnotic dream? In a key scene soon after this Haddo visits Margaret at her home and we clearly see his lips say the words \"your rape\" which sends her into the deepest despair. Whether the rape was actual or just implied quickly becomes a moot point because she goes away with him, convinced she can never marry Dr. Burdon now.Elements of the final reels of THE MAGICIAN figure prominently in the Universal film FRANKENSTEIN (1931). Haddo has a monolithic castle at the top of a mountain, a dwarf assistant do you think his name is Fritz?) and a well equipped lab. I think that not only director James Whale but also the set designer for FRANKENSTEIN had to have sat through this film more than once.Talkies came along about a year after this film was completed and Wegener, who was uncertain of his ability to speak English, returned to Germany. He was not alone, he was soon joined by Emil Jannings, Conrad Veidt and several other actors who had their doubts about being able to effectively perform in a foreign (to them)language.So is THE MAGICIAN worth seeing? Yes it is, despite its shortcomings it is a well paced and convincingly performed thriller. Give it a try.", "I read Carlos Clarens \"Horror Movies\" in '68 and it was one of the bigger influences on my movie tastes (as was seeing my first movie \"House on Haunted Hill\" in the theater with Emergo when I was five years old) so I'm inclined to recommend this movie for those who would like a fluid distillation of what was best about the silent cinema.I saw it at the Film Forum in NYC around '92 or '93. Ingram had moved to France and The Magician is notable for its documentary footage of Paris, Monaco and the French countryside. Wegener is a formidably grotesque presence and there is a remarkable set piece at the very beginning when a huge clay sculpture collapses, seeming at first to come to life, sending Alice Terry to the hospital. Oliver Haddo, the magician of the title, lurks in the observation gallery as a life saving operation is performed on her...This movie really has it all so don't miss it if you get the chance especially if you can see it with live musical accompaniment.", "In Paris, beautiful sculptress Alice Terry (as Margaret Dauncey) is critically wounded when a giant faun she is working on cracks, topples, and crushes her body. Ms. Terry's wealthy uncle summons American surgeon Ivan Petrovich (as Arthur Burdon) to operate on Terry's paralyzed body. The doctor and patient celebrate Terry's full recovery by falling in love. During their courtship, they encounter magician hypnotist Paul Wegener (as Oliver Haddo), an alchemist who witnessed Terry's miraculous surgery. A frightening, rotund man, Mr. Wegener happens to encounter Dr. Petrovich and Terry again and again. Wegener wants to create life, and has decided Terry will supply the \"Blood of a Maiden\" required in an ancient sorcerer's recipe!While still a young woman, Terry seems more like a matron than a maiden - guess you just have to assume \"The Magician\" knows a virgin when he sees one. In W. Somerset Maugham's original novel, the Terry character is a teenaged art student, and the intriguing Gladys Hamer (as Susie Boyd) an older rival; it's an excellent read, and fairly easy to find on line (for free). Most unclear, in the film, is exactly how Wegener's experiment is supposed to work. Playing \"Dr. Frankenstein\" (and inspiring the 1931 classic's design), Wegener sets up a lab to extract blood, apparently. Highlighted by a hellish hallucination, it's very nicely envisioned by Terry's skillful director husband Rex Ingram; but, it lacks the richness of plot abundantly available in the book.****** The Magician (10/24/26) Rex Ingram ~ Alice Terry, Paul Wegener, Ivan Petrovich, Firmin Gemier", "It's the Latin Quarter in Paris. Sculptor Margaret Dauncey is injured by a falling piece of art. Dr. Arthur Burdon's surgery saves her from paralysis and they fall in love. Oliver Haddo is the magician. He finds the magic formula to create human life in an old book. He steals the page and gives the book to Dr. Porhoet, Margaret's uncle, who is also looking for the formula.I love the old Paris locations and other exterior shots. It's an interesting little supernatural drama. It's the villain who is the most interesting. He's got good creepiness. It's a relatively simple story. With some more special effects, this could be a modern horror movie.", "A mad doctor and his hunchbacked assistant labor over their unholy experiments in an abandoned mountaintop castle during a fierce electrical storm. Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'? No, it's a W. Somerset Maugham story, filmed by Rex Ingram five years before the Boris Karloff classic, which in many ways it clearly anticipated. The film was one of the earliest horror dramas, and some of the unlikely but sensational plot twists (involving mesmerism, a virgin sacrifice, and a hallucinogenic trip to Hell) outraged polite audiences of its day. Most of the grisly details were artfully implied rather than overtly shown, making the film, in retrospect, superior to much of the broad melodrama surviving the silent age. Natural performances and realistic settings (Paris and Southern France) keep the colorful story from straining the limits of credibility, while the last minute rescue adds a satisfying (and, for the mad doctor, fatal) kick.", "In the 1920s films dealing with supernatural evil were extremely rare. However, director Rex Ingram, obviously influenced by earlier German forays into the supernatural, cast German actor Paul Wegener of DER GOLEM in this adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel THE MAGICIAN. Wegener's menacing performance as an evil Yogi in LEBENDE BUDDHAS (1925) made him a good choice to play Oliver Haddo, obsessed with creating life from an ancient formula requiring the heart's blood of a maiden, played by Ingram's wife Alice Terry.John F. Seitz' cinematography is superb, especially in the depiction of the heroine's hallucinatory descent into Hell where she is figuratively ravished by a lustful and athletic satyr. And although Haddo doesn't succeed in creating the grisly, half-complete humans as in the novel, the controversial subject matter was nevertheless strong enough to insure the film's failure at the box-office in 1926.Interesting comparisons have been made between this film and James Wale's FRANKENSTEIN, but the subject of black magic also invites comparison with later films - THE BLACK CAT (1934), THE NIGHT OF THE DEMON (1957), and THE DEVIL RIDES OUT (1968) - featuring characters who like Oliver Haddo were modeled on real-life occultist Aleister Crowley.", "THE MAGICIAN (1926) is a little-known slice of silent horror, lost for many years, but well worth checking out for those of us who enjoy watching the development of the genre. This is an atmospheric gem that seems to have influenced later hits like FRANKENSTEIN and has lots of reasons to watch. We begin with an accident scene which sees a girl crushed by a falling statue; her spine is saved by pioneering surgery, but she subsequently finds herself trapped in a love triangle between the surgeon who saved her and a creepy magician who seems determined to get hold of her blood for his own nefarious purposes! Lots of spooky moments throughout this fast-paced little number including a great and rather explicit dream sequence set in Hell itself. The excellent Paul Wegener, of such classics as THE GOLEM, plays the title character as a mad scientist who undoubtedly inspired similar portrayals in future years.", "Monday January 12, 7:00pm, Paramount Theater, SeattleA young artist falls in love with the surgeon who cures her paralysis following a horrible accident, but a mad scientist hypnotizes, then abducts her just as she and the surgeon are about to be married.Loosely based on Somerset Maugham's 1908 novel, The Magician (1926) stars Alice Terry as beautiful but timid Margaret Dauncey. Oliver Haddo, played with evil intensity by renowned German horror star Paul Wegener, is obsessed with creating human life by use of an ancient, stolen formula and imprisons Margaret in his mountaintop laboratory as part of the sinister plan.While considered something of a disappointment by director Rex Ingram, The Magician contains both frightening and beautiful imagery with a satisfying if rudimentary plot. Great attention to detail can be seen throughout the film, which includes spectacular location shoots in Paris and the Maritime Alps. Even in mediocrity, Ingram was vastly superior to nearly everyone else.", "Practically every element of this film holds up very well here in the twenty-first century, eighty-four years after the movie was made - the writing, the casting, the directing (and art direction), the photography (both indoor and outdoor), the \"costumes\" and \"sets\" (really, the fashions and architecture of the era were a captivating delight), and most of the acting. I say \"most\" because the only thing that seemed dated in this post-feminist era was the woe-is-me attitude of the hapless heroine.Particularly well-cast in terms of \"looking the part\" were the two male leads, both protagonist and antagonist. (After all, these were not speaking parts, so look was of high importance.)Surprisingly enjoyable were some quite subtle, non-intrusive comedic tension-breakers by peripheral characters, including some clever silent movie sight gags.The main recommendation I can make for seeing this film, however, is the clarity of the photography, both for the close-ups, and for some wonderful outdoor set pieces.", "\"The Magician\" {1926} is directed by Rex Ingram and stars Alice Terry as Margaret, Ivan P\u00e9trovich as Dr Arthur Burdon and Paul Wegener as Oliver Haddo, the villainous practitioner of Black Magic.If one is willing to make the necessary suspension of disbelief there isn't the slightest doubt but that the film provides loads of entertainment as a horror/thriller combination.The two leads don't have very much to do in terms of acting. Burdon is the usual faithful hero and Alice Terry's character spends most of her time staring helplessly about in a trance and looking full of Angst. Paul Wegner (who directed \"The Golum\" (1920)} steals every scene he's in with a wonderfully spectacular over-the-top melodramatic portrayal of the Magician who needs the heart blood of a maiden to create life {hmm . . . I wonder who's supposed to provide that ingredient}.Another star in the film is the great cliff-top, tower-castle of Hadoo himself, surrounded with bolts of lightning and filled with such items as strange potions which bubble and foam with a satisfactorily smoking violence, strange manuscripts and sinister props. When Hadoo picks up his box of sharp knives, one can't help noticing the nearby cupboard topped with a skull nicely festooned with cobwebs. There's the expected winding staircase to impede the heroic rescue and an open fully fired-up incinerator helps us along to the climax which ends with a suitable cataclysm.There are a very few points where the film is slightly disjointed--obviously owing to the fact that a few frames have been lost, but one soon forgets them. Generally the print used by TCM is very sharp and beautifully tinted. It's a pleasure to watch it. Robert Israel's score is well chosen, skillfully applied and very atmospheric. Note, for example, the reunion of hero and heroine is underlined by the love theme from Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet.The story of the film is based on a novel of the same name by Somerset Maugham and it is available for free download on Project Gutenberg. I've not read it yet but I might do so if only to compare the two approaches.This is a film I would recommend for the entertaining use it makes of the typical stereotypes of the horror genre but above all for Wegener's fabulous performance.", "Magician, The (1926)** (out of 4)Influential MGM horror/thriller has a magician/surgeon (Paul Wegener of The Golem) trying to find the secret of bringing the dead to life. After some research he learns that the blood of a virgin will do the trick. From a historic standpoint this film remains important due to its heavy influence on films such as The Raven, Murders in the Rue Morgue, Mystery of the Wax Museum and especially James Whale's Frankenstein but the film itself is pretty dull. The influences on those films isn't really seen until the final ten minutes and everything leading up to it is rather dry and doesn't contain any life at all. There's some nice visual touches and the use of shadows is good but the early German horror films done all of this much better. Directed by Rex Ingram.", "First time on TCM,so I was curious to see this old \"svengali\" type film.The name alone was intriguing \"The Magician\".What I found was a totally intact silent of the best quality.The Villain in the picture plays it to the hilt,in somewhat cartooned expressions,but always creepy and interesting.The backdrop of Paris is of interest as are the colour sequences.The clothing in this film are especially attractive as is the well groomed cast.I was captivated from start to finish,what a treat to see a silent as it should be.The acting was wonderful from all,even though I had never heard of these particular actors before.I am a lover of old horror films and this really fit the bill.Enjoyed the castle,and early special effects.", "A little bit of a mix between movies that came before and after it, the title character combining the mind control of Dr. Mabuse (1922) with the desire to create life of Dr. Frankenstein (1931), though it's actually based on the 1908 novel by W. Somerset Maugham. There's quite a bit of mood here in the scenes which work, and that's what put it over the top for me, despite plodding along a bit early on, including a snake charmer scene at a carnival that seems like a weak version of Browning. Eventually we get to the evil magician's laboratory, which is set in a cool tower high above a town, and what do you know, he's also got a hunchbacked assistant. He uses mind control on a young woman (Alice Terry) to get her to marry him instead of her fianc\u00e9e (Iv\u00e1n Petrovich) because he's found an ancient recipe for creating life, and it calls for the blood from the heart of a maiden. It's not exactly clear how that's supposed to work, beyond combining it with other unspecified things kept at 115 degrees, I mean, is life supposed to arise from a soupy mixture? It's not quite as well conceived as Frankenstein trying to animate a corpse, but it's suitably dark, and German actor Paul Wegener is strong in the leading role. In one fantastic scene, the film's best and a little reminiscent of Faust (1926), he casts an illusion for the young woman, one of a mostly naked satyr and various forest creatures dancing around in a mad orgy, leading to one of them biting down on her neck like a vampire. There are also some pretty shots in Paris, Monaco, and Nice. It's not perfect, but it's got some great moments and was clearly influential.", "This is a good-looking film. High production values. Beautiful location shooting. Excellent cinematography.The mad scientist is suitably creepy. The male lead handsome and heroic. And the female lead a beautiful damsel in distress.M favorite scene was the red-tinged descent into fantasy h3ll. If I had seen that when I was a kid I would have been afraid to go to bed for a week.On the other hand, the plot doesn't really have much motion. OK, mad scientist entices girl away from fiance. It's a little lethargic, to be honest. The climax is right out of a 1990s Hollywood movie. Fistfight, yawn.Enjoyable to see once, but for the location shooting more than the ''horror\" aspects, which I found pedestrian, other than the \"h3ll\" scene.", "In retrospect, one of MGM Studio's chief executives, Dore Schary, ranked the best silent movie directors in order: D. W. Griffith, Rex Ingram, Cecil B. DeMille and Erich von Stroheim. Ingram was a major influence in director David Lean's outlook on film while future director Michael Powell worked with Ingram when Rex was in France producing movies for MGM.As Ingram's career transitioned to Europe soon after his arrival in 1923, the director of 1921's \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" began to focus his subject matter more on the grotesque and spiritual world. His October 1926 \"The Magician\" is a prime example of the direction Ingram was steering towards. He adapted his script from the 1908 W. Somerset Maugham novel of the same name, which deals with a doctor who claims he can create life as long as he is able to secure the \"heart blood of a Maiden.\" Ingram's wife, Alice Terry, plays the potential victim who's hypnotically drawn to the doctor, Oliver Haddo (Paul Wegener). She ends up finding herself on the surgical table in Haddo's laboratory in his castle high up on a hill.If this sounds like the makings of a Frankenstein movie, the assumptions are correct. Director James Whale said he was heavily influenced by \"The Magician\" in its aesthetics, especially in the concluding castle sequences where he copied Ingram for his 1931 movie about the man-made monster.\"The Magician\" also garners its spookiness from the actor playing Haddo, Germany's Wegener. His appearance introduced to the American public the actor whose presence in that country's \"Golem\" series sent shivers down the spines of European theater-goers. This was Wegener's only Hollywood movie. Meanwhile, Alice Terry was Ingram's go-to female lead in this as well as a number of his films. Theirs was a rocky relationship soon after the couple's relocation to Nice, France. Her roles in several movies at the time playing opposite romantic lovers didn't sit well with the jealous Rex. But the couple did stay together for the remainder of Ingram's life.", "Getting back to the big stars of silents, it would be hard to go past Lon Chaney. Mockery (1927) presents Lon with a false nose and wig as a dim-witted Russian peasant who is almost persuaded by the popular comedian, Charles Puffy (here repulsively evil in a wholly dramatic role), to join the Russian Revolution.Oddly, the movie also boasts another well-known comedian-turned-serious-actor in its cast, namely Mack Swain as the grasping Gaidaroff.Although second-billed, Ricardo Cortez has only a small role to play, which he accomplishes with his usual finesse.Nonetheless, despite this grand roll-up - Chaney, Puffy, Swain, Cortez - it's actually Barbara Bedford's movie. She is superb! Hard to believe that in less than three years, her star would decline and she would spend the rest of her lengthy career playing scores and scores of walk-ons and bits.(Available on an excellent Warner Archive DVD).", ". . . of its time. THE MAGICIAN features rampant abuse of the differently-abled, as well as generous helpings of misogyny and a Luddite-like know-nothing anti-Science Agenda. The final 15 minutes of THE MAGICIAN is marred by the demeaning of a dwarf. Certain of these scenes resemble the Young Pachyderm Parties on Today's college campuses, in which the \"Dwarf Toss\" is a major pastime. Stuffing Little People into cramped pieces of furniture may seem \"cute\" to some twisted minds in these \"anything goes\" days of immorality with the Red Commie KGB egging on Americans to behave badly, but any self-respecting film studio should have known better than to foment such outrageous attitudes in the more civilized 1920s. The paternalism with which \"Margaret's\" guardian second-guesses her choice of a mate also sounds like something out of our current GIRL ERASED era. And the glee with which this authoritarian bozo closes out THE MAGICIAN by burning doomed \"Oliver's\" scientific papers, vandalizing his biological apparatus, and blowing up his entire laboratory definitely parallels this week's trashing of the 1,600-page Global Warming Disaster Alert.", "No matter how many silent films one watches, the differences in how stories are told compared to modern pictures never cease to amaze. Some titles go about their narrative and plot development very fluidly and naturally, but then there are instances in which the laying out of story beats are Just So, almost skipping from A to C (or D). Take for example the sudden blossoming of romance; the unexplained method by which characters come upon necessary information; the bizarrely specific requirements of what an enterprising and unscrupulous individual is attempting to achieve. More curious still is when a picture is so lackadaisical about exposition and early scene writing that the core plot seems weirdly sidelined. All this is true of Rex Ingram's 'The magician,' as it lays out certain foundations for the plot with a decided brusqueness while also taking its good time to especially go anywhere. Once the tale does pick up it's duly satisfying, and enticing - but I can understand the difficulty other viewers may have with the feature, above all those who don't ordinarily engage with the silent era.The narrative that emerges is one of desire, ambition, and exploration of the bounds of the natural world as they collide with the unnatural. By the standards of cinema at any point in subsequent years the result is less than gripping or thrilling, yet it's nonetheless engrossing, and tense and disquieting in accordance with the storytelling sensibilities of the 1920s. 'The magician' also gets more mileage out of the root premise than I'd have assumed, doing so in no small part by drawing out the machinations of the titular character rather than zeroing in on his greatest aspirations. For any shortcomings in how it first presents, ultimately the story is compelling; one recognizes a sense of horror that gradually shifts from more esoteric and thematic to actual - impactful all the while - and definite tropes that have been part of the genre practically since its inception.If the screenplay has its moments of weakness, in other regards 'The magician' is solid without a doubt. The filming locations are splendid, as are the production design and art direction. The effects employed here, relatively modest, are excellent all the same, as is the keen editing that helps to build atmosphere and which also effectively takes the place of where special effects might be employed in more modern titles. Ingram and his collaborating directors illustrate a rapt eye for shot composition, including fine use of lighting; shots and scenes are orchestrated very well generally, with the climax surely being the most captivating part of all. And while star Paul Wegener might strangely be the least impressive of anyone here, broadly speaking the cast is terrific in bringing their characters to life, and the feature as a whole.What we have when all is said and done is a classic that is unfortunately a bit slow at the outset, but as the length advances it shows its worth. There are, after all, airs of tension, suspense, and atmosphere, and one can recognize a through line from still earlier horror in film, to this, to genre flicks of the 30s and beyond. And regardless of labels, one way or another, at length 'The magician' comes off with strength and intelligence that it just takes some time to incubate. Recommended specifically for fans of the silent era, this still holds up fairly well almost 100 years later, and is worth checking out for those who appreciate older films."], "tt0017130": ["'The Bear's Marriage' is a very strange film. It has the general ambiance of a folktale, with much of the bloodshed and cruelty that many actual folktales possessed before they got bowdlerised for the nursery. This silent film was made in the early days of the Soviet regime, yet it takes place in Czarist Russia and two of the main characters -- depicted very unsympathetically -- are members of the Russian peerage. The general tone seems to be that no perversion or insanity is beyond the excesses of the blue-bloods.A Russian countess is frightened by a bear, shortly before she gives birth to the son who will inherit her husband's title. Years later, now a young man, the Count has a bizarre compulsion to dress in a bearskin and attack women ... specifically, young and pretty ones. We're given to understand that this homicidal fetish is due to prenatal influence, caused by the bear that scared his mother. The dowager countess, now elderly, has gone completely round the twist. We see her looking like Rochester's first wife in 'Jane Eyre': wild eyes, disarrayed hair, toothless.The Count marries a young woman ... without telling her about his hobby, of course. He can't even get through the honeymoon before he puts on the bearskin and kills her.The makers of this movie seem to be imitating 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari', or perhaps the Martian sequences in 'Aelita'. The costumes, make-up and sets are all highly stylised. Unfortunately, all of the acting is very stylised too. The extras in the crowd scenes seem to be obeying the commands of a drill instructor. The photography is very arty-tarty but often so dark that I could barely see what was going on. I can't 'bear' this movie, and I'll rate it just one point in 10."], "tt0017139": ["A quickie of some interest, despite (or maybe because) of its similarity to both The Bat (a sensational success on the Broadway stage when it debuted in 1920 and ran for a colossal 878 performances at the Morosco) and The Cat and the Canary, an obvious imitator which opened on Broadway in 1922 and ran for 349 performances at the National. Perhaps even more to the point, the much publicized film version of The Bat had its New York premiere on 14 March 1926. And just eleven days later, Midnight Faces made its appearance. Co-incidence? Hardly.Midnight Faces has all the standard ingredients of the creepy old house horror mystery, including clutching hands from a shadowy cloaked assassin who uses secret passages to make his escapes, a frightened heroine, stalwart hero, personable friend and comic butler. The house is sufficiently large and cavernously gloomy to lend color to the proceedings, and the pace is nothing if not brisk. It's good to see a young Jack Perrin in civvies as the ingratiating friend, while an equally youthful Bushman alertly holds down the role of the hero. Cohn (or Cohen, he was never quite sure how to spell his name) has directed with reasonable flair, though film editor Fred Bain has obviously had his work cut out to paper over some slips in continuity.", "I come out in favour of Midnight Faces, and even though I agree with both of the two previous posts makes it 2 - 1 for the moment! I too got this from AV, I'd not heard of it before and it was too irresistible and beguiling a title for me: to get it right I even watched it at midnight. The DVD is a budget release, so when the initial film frame wobble didn't go away I feared the worst, but it was suppressed after about 5 minutes, and although the print isn't in the best of shape it's bearable.The story itself? Likable, implausible, utter nonsense, but you can clearly see the links from Phantom Of The Opera to The Bat and Cat And The Canary, and as such I suppose makes it perhaps more interesting from the historical point of view. The \"hero\" Ralph Bushman was a bit of a serious wimp, but his \"man\" Martin Turner still had to call him Boss dozens of times throughout - and even he was under mortal threat from the mysterious figure lunging about the house: no favourites here! What I really liked about MF though is the atmosphere of the spooky old house, and the outside shots of it, a splendid wooden Gothic pile - it was fascinating watching the endless fight on the roof - for the house itself! Incidentally Bushman was rather hard pressed fighting a cloaked figure who insisted on continuously holding one arm up to hide his face.What a shame it wasn't just 10 minutes longer, and also what a shame if there isn't a better print extant.", "...from the long-forgotten Goodwill Productions company. Francis X. Bushman Jr. Stars Lynn Claymore, a nice young fellow who has inherited a large mansion in Florida swamp country. He arrives to take up residence with his attorney Richard (Jack Perrin), and his servant Trohelius Snapp (Martin Turner). Of course, it isn't long before a group of strangers show up, strange things start happening, people start disappearing, and a caped figure begins lurking in the shadows.Cheap, dumb, and often ridiculous, this is a complete waste of time for all but the most ardent of horror/mystery completists. The plot makes little sense, and although it's less than an hour long, that's still too much.", "This melodrama finds itself changing in tone throughout, from mystery to comedy to romance to horror, and fails on all counts to produce a reasonable degree of entertainment.  Set in, on and about a deserted house in Florida's Bayou region, the plot involves inheritance of the house by Lynn Claymore, (Francis X Bushman, Jr.) from an uncle of whom he was unaware and his arrival at the property to take possession, while having to deal with a hotchpotch of odd characters, each of whom presents an unknown agenda. These include a damsel in apparent distress, played by Kathryn McGuire, a favorite leading lady of Buster Keaton, a lawyer, a Chinaman, a negro valet, a united and sinister butler and housekeeper, a paralytic gentleman, and others.  In addition, the influence of a cloaked individual must be mentioned, as he is continually skulking about, disappearing into secret passages, and generally making the rest of the cast quite uneasy.  The valet is played by Martin Turner who must have influenced Eddie (Rochester) Anderson's style, as the latter's mannerisms are virtually interchangeable with those of the whimsical Turner, upon whose scenes one becomes increasingly willing to invest attention, as they are a welcome shift from the preposterous and cliche-beholden script.  The editing is indifferent at best, with some scenes being switched in continuity, and the direction by Bennett Cohen is by the numbers.  Those minutes when Bushman, and Jack Perrin as the probate lawyer, are alone and in conversation are effective due to their relaxed rapport and, if there were more of such, the grotesquerie would have been more palatable.  The film includes a most quaint fight sequence with the large and athletic Bushman having an extraordinarily difficult time in subduing a somewhat unprepossessing rival, with the action, because of  odd editing, continuing for about 20 minutes, while the other players remain determined to go about their business.  The engagingly original and motific score is played in witty fashion at the Wurlitzer by the talented Rosa Rio, who began her career in the 1920s in large theatres about New York and who achieved widespread and national acclaim for her musicality as accompanist to silent cinema.  Her contribution and the efforts by Turner are not enough aid in suppressing feelings of ennui for most viewers of this cartoonish mishmash.", ".....may have been a better name for it. This movie had everything that within ten years would become so pass\u00e9 in the \"old dark house\" and \"things that go bump in the night\" genres but in the mid twenties seemed so shiny and new!! There was the caped figure who walked with a shuffle but still managed to leap out of upper windows and onto the roof like an athletic teenager, an elderly man, wheel chair bound, assorted servants who looked like they stepped straight from a Charles Addams cartoon and a lovely damsel in distress. With all that there were still some surprises.Produced by Otto K. Shreier who didn't make many films (3) but all of them starred handsome Francis X. Bushman Jnr. who obviously inherited his father's matin\u00e9e idol looks but, alas, not his movie popularity as by the early 1930s he had descended to uncredited bits. Here he plays handsome (of course) Lynn Claymore who believes he has inherited a run down Southern mansion surrounded by swamp land that can only be reached by boat. At his late uncle's bequest he has to make his home there but if he dies within the year the estate reverts back to attorney Richard Mason (Jack Perrin, already, by 1925 entrenched in westerns - this was a rare diversion for him with not a horse or a saloon in sight). Even though the house has presumably been locked up since his uncle's death a caped and hooded figure is very much at home, jumping through windows, using all the trap doors and with his silhouette appearing menacingly on the walls.The plot thickens when a distraught young girl bursts into the house, fleeing for her life from an old Oriental gentleman who only minutes before was quietly rowing her across the swamp. Suddenly everyone looks shifty - eyes darting from side to side whenever gormless Lynn looks the other way.This is just a terrific movie that can stand on it's own merits - regardless of being compared to \"The Bat\" and \"The Cat and the Canary\", and all the more to it's credit that it was obviously a cheaply made programmer (nothing about it was cheap!!) Otis the creepy butler offers them both a nightcap in keeping with the uncle's tradition but when Lynn accidentally spills his, the cat who laps it up suddenly falls down dead!!Kathryn McGuire has what it takes to play a pretty colourless heroine. Although she didn't find the success that a lot of her WAMPAS class (of 1922) did, her beauty was on display in two of Buster Keaton's more popular films - \"Sherlock Jnr.\" and \"The Navigator\". By 1926 \"Midnight Faces\" seemed to be her one bright spot among westerns and serials.", "In the 1920s through the 1930s, Hollywood made quite a few old dark house movies--ones which have very, very similar plots involving a group of people stuck in a place with some maniacs. In light of this, \"Midnight Faces\" already has a major strike against against it. Just a few similar films would include \"The Old Dark House\", \"The Cat and The Canary\". \"The Bat\", \"The Black Cat\", \"The Bat Whispers\" and even comedies such as Harry Langdon in \"The First Hundred Years\", Buster Keaton in \"The Haunted House\" and Bob Hope in \"Ghost Breakers\"--and I'm sure I could come up with quite a few others if I tried!This film finds out hero inheriting an old estate in Florida. However, when he, his friend and his black man-servant (thrown in for comic relief) near the home, they think they see something moving inside. Once they take possession, some of the dead uncle's old servants arrive and they are a bizarre assortment of stereotypes--including a supposed Chinese man who look like he's just walked off a Fu Manchu film set! At night, trouble erupts and it's up to the leading man and his friends to get to the bottom of it. Much of it didn't make much sense until the very end--when the long and complicated plot is explained--including what REALLY happened to the uncle. There were a few surprises but all in all, the movie seemed terribly derivative--just like the many other similar films I've seen. It's pleasant enough but nothing special.By the way, one sour note in the film is the black servant. While he didn't over-react as badly as some black men in these films did, all too often they were included as a cheap laugh. Back then, white folks though it was hilarious to see a black man act cowardly and scared in these films. This role, like most of the films listed above, was present in this film but fortunately his performance wasn't as over the top or offensive as most--but it still wasn't necessary.", "Midnight Faces (1926)** (out of 4)Lynn Claymore (Francis X. Bushman, Jr.) inherits an old house out in the swamp in the middle of nowhere. Once there he sees a mysterious figure and lady a woman comes running in the house saying a madman with a knife is stalking her. This is an early \"old dark house\"/horror film that really doesn't know what it's trying to be. There's some minor comedy from the typical stereotyped black man, the horror elements aren't really creepy and the old dark house isn't all that creepy either. Even at 56-minutes this here seems a bit too long.As of now, this film is only available through the public domain company Alpha, so don't expect perfect quality.", "Badly written and badly directed, this film is only of historical interest, perhaps as an early example of the Old Dark House genre, or of the racial stereotyping of blacks as fearful, as superstitious, and as otherwise stupid. (There is also a stereotypical Chinaman in this movie.) There is relatively little story here: A Young Man has been informed by a Lawyer that the Young Man is an heir to an estate that includes an Old Dark House. He and various persons arrive, for various reasons yet all on the same day, for his first night there. One of them is a Young Woman who is subsequently menaced by a Cloaked Figure who makes use of secret passages within and to the house. Eventually the Cloaked Figure seizes the Young Woman, and he is pursued. During this pursuit and the fight that erupts, the respective roles of the other characters are revealed.The internal logic of the story fails repeatedly. For example, early in the story the audience sees the Cloaked Figure climbing in and out of windows of the Old Dark House, but there doesn't seem to have been a good reason at that point for him not to have simply used the hallways within the house. The Cloaked Figure has, as it turns out, a good reason to menace the Young Woman; but he also menaces the Black Servant for no good reason. Twice the Young Man responds to cries for help as if wondering just what \"Help!\" might mean. His initial response to the Cloaked Figure is as if such things are merely a nuisance to be expected in one's home. After the Cloaked Figure has seized the Young Woman, it eventually dawns on the Young Man that her situation might be urgent, but his subsequent search for her is rather desultory, and includes a pause during which he and another white fellow mock the Black Servant as a foolish braggart. None of the ostensible Good Guys are inclined to dash when they could walk briskly, and one is lucky if they do even that. During the final conflict between the Young Man and the Cloaked figure, the other Good Guys essentially mill-about, as if having joined the audience (albeit with a greater level of interest than the audience must now feel).", "Now, many people claim that \"Midnight Faces\" (!926), which was released very shortly after \"The Bat\", which is regarded today as the precursor of all the great classic mystery movies of the 30s, was in a way an 'imitation' - and yet (taking NOTHING away from \"The Bat\": it IS an absolute masterpiece!), \"Midnight Faces\" at this early stage ALSO contains about ALL the necessary ingredients for a really great, scary and at the same time entertaining mystery: an isolated old mansion, without electric light, of course, dark figures creeping through the hallways, shadows on the walls, a mysterious Asian hiding in the garden, a damsel in distress - and a Mantan Moreland-style secretary for the comical relief!Besides, the plot is VERY clever and twisted, with a REAL surprise ending; and the acting is marvelous and quite natural for the time: starring young Francis X. Bushman Jr., the son of THE matin\u00e9e idol of the 1910s, and pretty Kathryn McGuire whom we first pity and then suspect, \"Midnight Faces\", which has been overshadowed by \"The Bat\" for so long (and over the years almost sunken into oblivion), surely is another one of the GREAT forerunners of this wonderful classic mystery genre, and I think it does deserve more attention by classic movie buffs as well as by critics!", "Indeed an early attempt at a spooky or haunted house movie but a really abominable one. With a running time around 55 minutes this still felt pretty long. The story is pretty awful and the characters are as thin as paper. We have a black butler who is clich\u00e9 cowardly and superstitious and serves merely as the comical relief but I didn't find it funny at all, very annoying to be honest. So there is also a man from China who is staring at the house for most of the movie and a overlong and silly fight between good and bad guy towards the end. The damsel in distress was also very clich\u00e9 merely serving as an excuse for the bad guy to abduct her and the others to come into action. The setting was good but the rest was totally forgettable. I suggest watching The Cat and the Canary which came out a bit later instead.", "I'd like to give this film a higher rating but the poor editing and lack of continuity hurt the film. While it seems to a rip-off of the Cat and the Canary and The Bat, Midnight Faces does offer an enjoyable almost hour of viewing (the film clocks in at 53 minutes. While the acting is static (it is apparent that this is a poverty row production) the plot is good but the directing is another story (message to directors: either be a writer or a director, don't try to impress moviegoers by being a triple threat! It rarely works.) Bushman is tall, handsome, and virile. Kathryn McGuire is an attractive flapper type, and the rest of the rest is adequate. The biggest problem with this film is that the end comes so quickly. Other issues I noticed, why do the other cast members stand and watch Bushman beating the pulp out of the villain instead of rushing to his aid? Also, why is Bushman's valet seen crawling on the ground at the end of the film attempting to sprinkle salt on a pigeon or it is a pathetically small chicken? Lastly, why is the action in the film taking place at midnight when it is obviously daytime? This could have been an impressive late silent era film but the crude presentation of it makes it a film few will want to see. Still, give it a look if for just curiosity sake."], "tt0017621": ["Being a product of the Silent era, this German variation on the Frankenstein theme actually preceded the definitive James Whale pictures; a rare (the copy I acquired was culled from an old Italian TV broadcast that I somehow missed out on) and still very little-known film \u2013 despite the involvement of Henrik Galeen (THE GOLEM [1914 and 1920], NOSFERATU [1922] and THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE [1926]), Brigitte Helm (METROPOLIS [1927]) and Paul Wegener (THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE [1913], THE GOLEM [1914, 1917 and 1920] and THE MAGICIAN [1926]) \u2013 this is probably due to the fact that, in spite of some clear Expressionist trimmings, the plot is mainly treated as sophisticated melodrama! Especially disappointing for genre buffs is the fact that the creation scene is completely by-passed \u2013 shown only in a split-second flashback towards the end when Alraune (Helm, a veritable femme fatale spawned from the mandrake root by ambitious alchemist Wegener) discovers her unnatural origin when she happens upon the scientist's diary! Galeen, however, demonstrates a sure eye for pictorial detail throughout (particularly when dealing with the carnival and casino settings) and the basically 'incestuous' relationship between creature and creator is treated with amazing sensitivity and depth for its time. The ending, then, is equally non-horrific as Alraune, resigned now to her soulless existence, goes away with her creator's long-infatuated nephew while Wegener pays the price for his tampering with nature by being left all alone.", "Poison AngelBased on the medieval legend of the Mandrake, a root, which grew beneath the gallows from the semen of hanged men, Hanns Heinz Ewers novel Alraune was brought to the screen in 1928 by Ama-Film GmbH and director Henrik Galeen (The Student of Prague 1926, Nosferatu 1922 \u0096 as screenwriter). Paul Wegener (The Golem 1920, The Magician 1926) stars as Professor Jakob ten Brinken, the \"world famous authority on genetic cross-breeding\", who implants a prostitute with the 'seed' of a hanged man in order to study the effects of environment over genetics on the offspring. The resulting child is Alraune, whom Brinken calls 'Mandrake', played by Brigitte Helm (Metropolis 1927, The Love of Jeanne Ney 1927). Alraune is raised in a convent, ignorant of her origins, believing Brinken is her father. Just as the Professor is convinced, his 'experiment' has overcome her genetic history she runs away with a boy and begins a life of troubled encounters with men. Helm is both innocent, alluring and at times intensely evil in this captivating performance of a lovely young girl, both attracted to and in conflict with the men in her life. As in the novel, which this film closely follows, the idea and understanding of love is unknown to Alraune. As she chats with a circus magician she shares her train compartment with, his real intentions unknown to Alraune, he entertains her with slight-of-hand tricks. He produces a live mouse that he places on her leg and it quickly crawls under her skirt as the girl calmly observes. \" What? You are not afraid of mice? Little girl. You will make something of yourself.\" While the film was heavily censored in 1928, this surviving scene must have been, and remains today, tremendously provocative.Brinken eventually finds Alraune, living as a circus performer, just as she rebels against the magician's attempts to control her flirtations with another man. \" Stop me if you can!\" In one of the most electrifying scenes in all of Weimar Cinema, Alraune opens the door to the lion's cage now on the stage and steps in. As the curtain opens, the crowd reacts in utter horror while, outside the cage, circus performers furiously run in all directions. Alraune stands before several enormous lions she teased only moments earlier, completely motionless, as the camera cuts to a close-up of her penetrating eyes.Once they are away from the circus, Brinken determines to start a new life with the girl, but Alraune again plots to run away with another man. As she is leaving, she finds the Professor's diary and discovers the truth of her existence, \"Where do I belong in society?\" Alraune bitterly decides to stay with Brinken and seek her revenge, feeling unfit for the man she now loves. She tortures Brinken by constantly flirting with men. As her ultimate insult, Alraune, dressed from head to tow in shimmering silk, seduces Brinken, \"Do you really think I haven't known all along that I am not your daughter?\" She runs off, depriving him and the torture continues. Financially and morally destitute, Brinken confronts Alraune as she packs her bags to leave. In a harrowing scene, he chases her from room to room with a large knife. Just as her death seems imminent, Alraune is saved by her lover and Brinken is left to suffer \"the hell of loneliness and insanity.\"An overlooked treasure, Alraune represents the height of silent film in the Weimar era. With the exception of early scenes featuring Alraune's 'mother' and the convent, the film is entirely occupied by men, surrounding Helm like the unnoticed setting of a luminous jewel.", "ALRAUNE is another spectacular piece of early German cinema, surprisingly overlooked by film buffs and historians alike.  The film is not \"expressionist\" in the way of CALIGARI or METROPOLIS, but fans of those films will enjoy it regardless.The plot (without spoilers) is creepy to begin with: a scientist (Paul Wegener) decides to experiment with humanity by creating a woman from the seed of a hanged man impregnated into a prostitute.  Using two reprehensible creatures as parents, as well as artificial insemination (which is implied in the film, not stated as some articles on the film have indicated), the doctor aims to see if an individual's humanity is the product of nature or nurture.The woman he creates, called Alraune (although called \"Mandrake\" in the english title cards, a name ill-fitting the overtly feminine character) is played by Brigitte Helm. No better casting for this part could have been made at the time: Helm's performance here far surpasses that of her most famous film role (the robotrix from Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS) and (I feel) solidifies her position as top femme fatale of that era.  Her sensuous, provocative movements, gestures, stares and sneers even outshine those of Marlene Deitrich in years to come.  There are moments where Helm slips into the silliness that harms her role as Maria in METROPOLIS (flailing about wantonly), but these are kept to a minimum by the director.Paul Wegener, as the doctor, also proves to be an actor out of time.  His performance would stand up to modern criticism, as it lacks the usual melodramatic facial manipulations or exaggerated movements of many silent film male stars.  Rather, Wegener tells us his characters thoughts and feeling swith subtle glances, almost imperceptible lip movements, and ingenius body posture.  Wegener, you may recall, played the great clay giant Der Golem in his film of the same name; to see Wegener play this role, sans makeup and gravitas, is to understand the strength of his abilities.Overall the film is very good, although suffers from an ending not in keeping with all that builds up to it.  A seduction scene between father and \"daughter\" is outrageous even by today's standards.  But Alraune/Mandrake is presented as almost soulless, and this is much diluted by the end, although not truly explained.  Was it nurture after all?  Possibly, but the doctor's role in Alraune's maturation is almost nonexistent (she is raised in a girl's school, and spends the rest of the time running away from \"father.\") The film fails to answer the questions is presents.  However, this may be one of the few negative symptoms of German silent films, which seem to universally fall apart at the resolution, backing away from the horrors they presented throughout.I am not sure if the version currently available on video is complete, but seems to soft-pedal the insemination issue (some viewers will think mandrake root was used as opposed to the hanged man's seed.)  The title cards are few and far between, allowing the visuals to tell the story, not the dialog.For fans of the Frankenstein myth, Alraune presents another take on the tale of scientific hubris gone awry.  An excellent film, it should be sought out in favor of the later (weaker) \"Unholy Love\" remakes.", "I've just seen the world theatrical premier of the Munich Filmmuseum's restoration of this classic, presented by University of Chicago's Documentary Film Group in cooperation with Chicago's Goethe Institute and Lufthansa.  Live piano accompaniment was provided by the excellent Aljoshe Zimmerman with an introduction by Stefan Dr\u00f6\u00dfler, director of the Filmmuseum.  Zimmerman composed the score for the Filmmuseum and additionally accompanied \"Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens\" (also restored and presented as a double feature).   The restoration was pieced together largely from surviving reels from Russia and Denmark, which focused on Alraune's mother and father, respectively.  The restoration sports quite a few intertitles, in German, some of which were present in the original. Absolutely remarkable, and a must for anyone who appreciates excellent cinema.", "There exist several versions of this \"Alraune\" movie, also another starring Brigitte Helm, but this very old one we have here is from 1928, so almost 90 years old and possibly the most known film. It is in black-and-white and silent and stars the aforementioned Brigitte Helm (\"Metropolis\") as the main character. The movie is fairly long for its time, almost runs for 110 minutes and features some of the great silent film actors. The writer and director is Henrik Galeen, who himself id known for writing the scripts and screenplay for some of the great classics from that era of German cinema. So, the premise is pretty good, but the overall outcome here is a bit disappointing I must say. The reason may be that I am not the greatest silent film fan at all, but still I felt that the plot was extremely shallow, especially for a film with such a massive runtime. There was not a single character that I really truly cared for and that includes Helm's main character as well as the minor players. I give \"Alraune\" a thumbs down. This one is really only worth seeing for the very biggest silent film enthusiasts. Everybody else will be as bored as I was.", "Two monsters meet in this second adaptation of Hanns Heinz Ewers' novel: Paul Weneger, actor and director of \"Der Golem\" (1920), and Brigitte Helm, diva of Fritz Lang's masterpiece \"Metropolis\" (1927).Classified as science fiction and horror, the film was more of a fantasy to me. A scientist decides to inseminate a prostitute with a mandrake root that grew thanks to the semen of a murderer who was hanged on a tree. In the first scene, we learn that it is a full moon night and that someone will dig directly under the hanged man's body to remove the root. It will be used for the experiment. The result will be a living creature: Alraune.The film (or the copy I saw) makes a discreet ellipsis when the prostitute enters the scientist's experiment room, and in the next scene, we see young Alraune (mandrake, in German) in a boarding school ruled by nuns, from which she will escape with the scientist's worthless nephew. In the story that continues, there is no science fiction or terror, but the drama of a woman who ignores her origin. Her attempts to love and live freely are frustrated every time her \"father\" intrudes. He is convinced that Alraune has inherited anti-social traits from her prostitute mother and murderous father. However, what Alraune really wants is to enjoy life: she escapes with a magician to a circus, flirts with the animal trainer and meets a good viscount who falls for her and proposes marriage. But papa scientist does not give up, so she decides to take revenge.Brigitte Helm, who, as in \"Metropolis\", alternates between innocent sweetness and malicious eroticism, contributes to the fascination of the story. Director Henrik Galeen uses expressionist images, although the realistic approach predominates. It is a pity that the restored version is not available and what circulates is a vile copy of a VHS edition in English, with music often out of place and with the name of the protagonist changed to Mandrake. However, curiosity is curiosity and there is no one who can beat our archaeological passion for cinema.", "Paul \"The Golem\" Wegener creates Brigitte \"Metropolis\" Helm from the sperm of a condemned man and the egg of a prostitute to disprove genetic theory and names her Mandrake after a plant that grows beneath the gallows and brings either very good or very bad luck. She's raised in a convent where she drowns flies, puts spiders in the nuns' habits, and demands a smitten young swain steal money from his father's bank so they can run off together. He does, they do -and soon join a circus where every man is at Mandrake's feet. Her \"father\" eventually finds her, brings her home, and introduces the girl into society where she has the same devastating effect on anything in pants ...including her creator. Uh oh.A great tale (based on German legend) with plenty of potential is told in pedestrian fashion (no Expressionism, here) and further diluted by a half-way happy ending (!) that has Mandrake falling in love and finding happiness while \"father\" goes insane for tampering with things no mortal should. The artificial insemination angle would have been verboten in Hollywood at the time but Weimar Germany was most likely unfazed. The 1952 remake with Erich von Stroheim and Hildegarde Knef gave ALRAUNE the ending it cried out for.", "An unscrupulous doctor (Paul Wegener) creates a living 'mandrake', the soulless offspring of a prostitute inseminated with the semen taken from an executed criminal. The unnatural progeny, Alraune (German for mandrake), is played by temptress extraordinaire Brigitte Helm, best known for playing the saintly Maria and her evil Maschinenmensch avatar in Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927). Although the film is sometimes classified as horror/science fiction, it is more of a romantic melodrama, as the doctor slowly becomes infatuated with his creation, who is beginning to aspire to human feelings. Human artificial insemination had been around since the late 1700s, so other than the choice of sperm donor, there is nothing particularly novel about the premise, which is essentially a test of the frequently overly-simplified 'nature/nurture' dichotomy (in reality, it is nature 'plus' nurture, not nature 'or' nurture). The eponymous 1911 novel by Hanns Heinz Ewers had been films twice before this version and several times afterwards but the 1928 silent is considered to be truest to the original story. The film has not aged well - not a lot happens and the silent acting comes off as a bit theatrical. There are several versions on-line, with and without music. The image quality in the one I watched was not great but the score, a mix of recognisable 'classics', helped pass the time spent watching the relatively boring film.", "There can't be a review giving this silent movie any proper judgement. One star is as possible as ten stars are since you are guessing anyway, because whatever version you watch, it is incomplete: The longest version up to date, being merged from Russian and Italian analog material, is still missing 400 m. Especially a dance performance of vanguard artist Valeska Geert is totally lost, among other scenes. And this might also explain why we don't see laboratory scenes of Alraune's making.So this movie lacks coherence, though the acting of Wegener and Helm is superb and subtle, unlike common silent movies. Still, if you are not (yet) into silent movies or Brigitte Helm's eyes, better start with one that wasn't so much tampered with. But if you'll watch this one, then you are to enjoy a great allegory about humanity being proud of a creation of its own making, then falling for it which works on the destruction of its creator.", "Hanns Ewers wrote the original screenplay for 'The Student of Prague', the finest version of which is generally considered to be that of 1926 directed by Henrik Galeen. Here Galeen directs this extremely loose adaptation of Ewer's novel 'Alraune' which reunites him with star and co-director of 'The Golem', Paul Wegener, who plays mad scientist Jakob ten Brinken. The role of the soulless femme fatale Alraune who drags men to their doom is tailor-made for Brigitte Helm, following her impact in Lang's 'Metropolis'.By the time Ewer's novel was published, news of Russian experiments in artificial insemination involving animals had already reached the West and seemed the stuff of nightmares. Such a pity therefore that this film fails to fulfill expectations.Although it contains some Expressionist flourishes it lacks the overall visual style and imaginative flair of Galeen's contemporaries, early scenes are victims of censorship cuts, the succession of men who fall under the spell of Alraune's sexual charisma are little more than ciphers and it is weakened by a lame, unsatisfactory ending.The real fascination of the piece lies in the dynamic between Paul Wegener and Brigitte Helm whose scenes together are riveting.Despite its weaknesses the influence on Hollywood's mad science/creation films is there for all to see although its depiction of destructive female sexuality would never be replicated.", "How is it possible for any movie to be an almost exact copy of Metropolis, only a year later, and still be praised for being a so called \"master\"work?? That goes beyond me. It's really utter nonsense. Yuck yuck yuck!!!", "The Austrian filmmaker Henrik Galeen is one of the beacons of the rightly celebrated expressionism of German film in the 10s and 20s, while his name is wrongly known to very few and mostly goes under the weight of the work of directors such as Fritz Lang or Robert Wiene. His work Alraune shows how exceptional Galeen was at what he did.Galeen uses the novel by Hanns Heinz Ewers, which anticipated the concept of artificial insemination by decades and addressed it. The director brought the book, and thus the subject, to a wider audience than Ewers' book could.A Frankenstein-esque professor (the equally gifted filmmaker Paul Wegener, who later became an opportunist through his association with the fascists of National Socialism) plans to create a woman based on the Alraune myth, i.e. The human-shaped plant that symbolizes misfortune and happiness can bring, especially in relation to childbearing. The professor thinks about the breeding of certain types of people in an anti-humanistic manner and decides, to explain his words, to use \"degraded subjects of society\" for this experiment. The portrayal of the involuntary nature of the participants, the inhuman view of people and human experiments, the lack of ethics on the part of a scholar or doctor are all anticipations of what would soon doom Germany and then Europe and large parts of the world. The result is Alraune (Brigitte Helm), the first human being to use artificial insemination. She grew up in a convent school, apparently an experiment in the perverted educational-theoretical sense of the neo-humanists, looking for the relationship between genetics, i.e. The predestination of human existence, and socialization, i.e. The influences of the environment on the human individual. Alraune escapes from this experiment and ends up at the circus after her anti-social attitude has already been shown several times. Helm plays Alraune really impressive. She vacillates between the experimental malignancy of the being and the incomprehension of one's own being, which triggers sadness in the main character.The professor can finally find Alraune, but Alraune finds out what kind of machinations she came into being and decides, almost according to her nature, but still understandable for everyone, to take revenge on the professor. This requires an understanding of injustice, through which the wonderful dialectic of the film stands out very clearly. Mandrake may be created from the \"corrupt\", but the basis of her nature lies in the facets of the human. The professor, on the other hand, came about \"naturally\" but is himself a being who inflicts suffering on other people - and this without the history of the injustice inflicted that Alraune experienced.The magical, surreal aspects of the plot now come more and more to the fore through the main character. She seduces the professor and ruins him, especially financially; the human aspect no longer seemed to have played a major role in this blueprint of fascist medicine.Ultimately, after completing her revenge, Alraune decides against the predestination of the experiment and proves the will of man as the good of his self-determination. The fact that love is the decisive factor here is part of the history of modern educational sciences, which rightly determined that, for example, parental love or friendly affection play an important role in the good development of a human being.In this way, Henrik Galeen packs a fundamentally humanistic statement into an hour-and-a-half film and inspires with the basic characteristics of expressionist filmmaking. Impressive images, surreal confusion, a spider's web of theses and refutations make this film a classic in film history."], "tt0017739": ["The 1922 play THE CAT AND THE CANARY was so popular that it made the fortune of author John Willard, who lived to see it filmed no fewer than three times before his death in 1942. Even today the story remains a classic of its kind, inspiring a host of films that mix comedy, mystery, and horror--not to mention still more that focus on suspicious doings in old, dark houses. When questioned by author Gavin Lambert, director James Whale very specifically indicated that the 1927 film version, along with the 1928 THE LAST WARNING, influenced his own work in such films as FRANKENSTEIN and THE OLD DARK HOUSE.Both THE CAT AND THE CANARY and THE LAST WARNING were created for Universal by director Paul Leni. But while THE LAST WARNING is not presently available to the home market, THE CAT AND THE CANARY most certainly is, and even some eighty years later is possible to see what all the fuss was about. In term of cinematography, CAT is a remarkably imaginative film, using a series of over-lapping images, close-ups, and dissolves to astonishing effect. In a visual sense it is easily one of the most stylish films of the silent era.The plot is a classic of its kind. Like the original Willard play, the film's story mixes a host of already-clich\u00e9d ideas with several then-new ones. Today, of course, it can be a bit difficult to them apart! But even so it remains a fair amount of fun. An eccentric millionaire has been hounded to death by his greedy relatives--and when he dies he leaves behind a will that imposes a twenty year waiting period between his death and delivery of his estate to his heir. But who will the heir be? The candidates assemble to hear the will at midnight... and no sooner is the heir named than strange doings are afoot.The characters are archetypes: the nice girl (Laura La Plante), the mild-mannered boy (Creighton Hale), the fashion princess (Gertrude Astor), the battle ax matron (Flora Finch), and so on. Perhaps most memorable is the housekeeper (Martha Mattox), an exceedingly dour woman most ironically named Mammy Pleasant! Add in an exasperated lawyer, a creepy doctor, secret passages, hairy hands with needle-like finger nails, stolen diamonds, and as many dashes of comedy as you can get away with, mix well, and you have the inspiration for a seemingly endless list of classic films.Although they may seem overly broad by modern standards, the cast plays at the level of what was considered comic-realistic in the late silent era, the production values are first rate, and the plot is quirky enough in a silly sort of way to make the whole thing fun. But it is really the direction and the look of the thing that scores; in its best moments, THE CAT AND THE CANARY is plenty good indeed.The film is available in several DVD releases. You should avoid the Alpha release; although the picture is passable, the score is so dire that it completely undermines the film. Although it clearly needs further restoration, the Image release is superior and offers your choice of scores, both of which work with the film rather than against it. Recommended for silent fans and those interested in the development of the classic horror film!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "Like the deadly game between THE CAT AND THE CANARY, so a young heiress feels trapped in a very peculiar haunted house, surrounded by lurking, unseen evils...This is a dandy old creeper of a silent horror film, with just the right mix of menace & mirth to please the uncritical viewer. Universal gave the movie very fine production values, which extend not only to the atmospheric sets, but also to the humorously spooky title cards scattered throughout.This film is really story driven, rather than dominated by the personalities of its stars. However, mention should be made of very entertaining performances by Tully Marshall as the scabrous old lawyer, Flora Finch as a terrified auntie, and Lucien Littlefield as an exceedingly strange doctor. Laura La Plante as the lovely, frightened heiress & Creighton Hale as her nervous, scatterbrained cousin give a light touch to the romantic subplot.THE CAT AND THE CANARY is a choice example from the Old Dark House genre of spook tales. All the elements are here: distressed young ladies, a crumbling mansion, a housekeeper of baleful aspect, a lawyer who knows too much, an escaped lunatic, stalking ghosts or monsters, missing wills, meetings at midnight, bony and/or hairy hands appearing from hidden bedroom panels, secret passageways,  and sudden death. Unnerved characters are forever making silly choices which always lead them into the clutches of the ravening ghosts/monsters/lunatics. But the Old Dark House has for long years been a respected avenue in literature & movies to maximize suspense & tension. Indeed, it's only a short walk from West Mansion in this film to Wuthering Heights, Baskerville Hall, Manderley & the Bates House...", "The millionaire Cyrus West has spent the last years of his life in his mansion nearby the Hudson River considered insane by his greedy relatives and feeling like a canary in a cage surrounded by cats. When he dies, he stipulates that his lawyer Roger Crosby (Tully Marshall) would read his will that is kept in a safe in the twentieth anniversary of his death. On the scheduled day, Cyrus West's loyal servant Mammy Pleasant (Martha Mattox) and the lawyer welcome the guests in the creepy mansion that people tells that is inhabited by ghosts: West's nephews Harry Blythe (Arthur Edmund Carewe), Charles \"Charlie\" Wilder (Forrest Stanley), the scared Paul Jones (Creighton Hale), Aunt Susan Sillsby (Flora Finch), Cecily Young (Gertrude Astor) and West's niece Annabelle West (Laura La Plante). When Roger Crosby opens the will, West's mansion and fortune are left to the most distant relative having the name West, meaning Annabelle. However, she should prove first that she is sane; otherwise, the inheritance would be bequeathed to another heir whose name is in a sealed envelope. Out of the blue, a guard (George Siegmann) comes to the mansion and tells that a dangerous lunatic has fled from an institution. During the night, Roger Crosby disappears and Annabelle receives an envelope from Mammy Pleasant where West tells the location of his precious diamonds. Annabelle finds the jewels and wears a necklace, but while she is sleeping, a hand comes from the wall and steals the diamonds from her neck. With the exception of Paul Jones that loves Annabelle, her relatives believe that she is insane. But when Annabelle finds a hidden chamber in the wall with the body of Roger Crosby, Mammy Pleasant decides to call the police and the identity of the lunatic is disclosed.\"The Cat and the Canary\" is a creepy mystery and horror silent film by the German Expressionist director Paul Leni. The plots blends black humor with elements of horror using the atmosphere of the expressionism with shadows and lighting, and the result is a stylish movie where even the inter-titles are funny. The beauty of Laura La Plante is very impressive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"O Gato e o Can\u00e1rio\" (\"The Cat and the Canary\")", "This late silent movie shows off the considerable talents of its director, Paul Leni, as the camera prowls the environs of an old dark house with the gracefulness of a cat, while the actors bob around like canaries, forming uneasy alliances and plotting against one another. The cast is well chosen. Laura La Plante makes a lovely heroine, while bespectacled Creighton Hale makes an agreeable, somewhat Harold Lloyd-like hero. Tully Marshall and Martha Mattox represent, none too flatteringly, the older generation; the former has the face of a drawn, white prune, while the latter makes a perfect battle-axe as the ironically named Mammy Pleasant. By today's standards the movie isn't too scary, though its mood of foreboding is still effective. Its qualities are pictorial more than dramatic, and the print I saw was badly in need of restoration.The Cat and the Canary is a key film of the silent era, and was hugely influential in kicking off the old dark house genre that continued into the early talkie period. When sound came in the wisecracks proliferated, which tended to lighten the mood and detract from the suspense. In this one the humor is visual, and the tone is more consistent. There have been dozens remakes and imitations over the years, but the dark, Gothic beauty of the original has never been surpassed.", "Whether you take it as a good-natured send-up of the 'old dark house' genre, or simply as a semi-serious horror/comedy, either way \"The Cat and the Canary\" is good entertainment.  The atmosphere in the dusty old mansion is done very well, with plenty of creativity, and the story moves at a good pace and is told well.  These are more than enough to make up for a few plot holes and a couple of characters that are left undeveloped.The cat/canary image, which was deliberately exaggerated somewhat, is simple but it ties the story and characters together rather well.  Most of the characters are interesting, although a couple of them never really take shape.  Most of the performers seemed to enjoy their roles, and they worked well together, with most of them making good use of their moments in the spotlight.If you enjoy silent movies, you should find this a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so.", "This movie had incredible production values--with amazing and creepy cinematography and an excellent musical score in the latest restored version. They did so much to set the mood and make this a genuinely scary film.The story concerns a rich old guy who has written a strange will. It is only to be read after 20 years and remains sealed until that time. His surviving relatives all return like vultures to pick at the fortune but instead of dividing it among them, he leaves it to one of them with another to receive the fortune if anything happens to the sole inheritor. Naturally, bad things start to happen and the film becomes a whodunit. At times it's really good--with lots of trap doors and suspense, but it also suffers from predictability. The actual conclusion isn't all that surprising. Considering how few potential murderers there are among them and how the one guy sneaks away early in the film with a flimsy excuse, it isn't too surprising who is doing all the bad things in the old dark home.It's very entertaining and fun--just not exactly the best conclusion I have ever seen.", "I've read other user comments on this film, and I want to add my own. \"The Cat and The Canary\" is one of those films that is often spoken about as being one of the classic horror films of the silent era, and after watching this film it is easy to see why.From the opening sequence, of a hand brushing away dust and cobwebs to reveal the films title, to the closing shot, the film is very spooky.  Yes, I will say that at times the film is almost too spooky, and that some of the acting is overdone.The plot of the film is simple:  20 years after a wealthy and thought to be insane man has died, his family gathers to read the contents of his will.Those who see this film will see all types of cliches in the horror movie genre, hidden panels, hands reaching out from behind walls, creepy shadows, but the interesting thing to note is that this film was among the first to use these effects, in other words you are seeing these things occur before they became commonplace.This was an early horror film made by Universal Pictures, fresh on the success of other classic Universal horror films like Phantom of the Opera and Hunchback of Notre Dame.The director of this film, Paul Leni, was German, and the film directly relates that.  This film is a classic example of how German filmmaking influenced American films.  If you like this film, and especially the camera style, stylish sets, and the general modd and feel of the film, take a look at other German silent films, and you will love them as well.This film is now Public Domain, and is available on DVD and VHS from several companies.  IMDB lists its length in the 80 minute range, however the version I saw, with a new score is 101 minutes long.  I highly reccomend this film.", "I recall being somewhat underwhelmed by this on first viewing (its reputation having ensured it a place in my very first online DVD purchase!) but, rewatching the film now, sees it elevated to its rightful place among the best horror films of the Silent era - indeed one of the great Silents, period.It's the quintessential \"old dark house\" film which, in their 1920s heyday, seemed to always incorporate comedy (since many of these had actually originated on the stage). Of its kind, I've also watched THE MONSTER (1925; starring Lon Chaney) as well as the Talkie remake of THE BAT (1926), called THE BAT WHISPERS (1930) - all of these, incidentally, were made by director Roland West; one more I'd love to catch up with is Benjamin Christensen's SEVEN FOOTPRINTS TO Satan (1929), though two other films he did in the same vein - THE HAUNTED HOUSE (1928) and HOUSE OF HORROR (1929) - are, regrettably, considered lost! Leni himself directed THE LAST WARNING (1929; though that was actually set inside a theater).Anyway, the film certainly provided the right atmosphere: visually, it's a real treat (even if the DVD I own is the earlier Image edition, i.e. not the Remastered one) - highlighting Gilbert Warrenton's mobile camera and optical effects and Charles D. Hall's fantastic set design (but even the title cards bring their own inventiveness!). The cast, some of whom are familiar (such as Tully Marshall, Arthur Edmund Carewe, George Siegmann and Lucien Littlefield), is well-assembled - even if none of the roles require much depth and are more or less stereotypes, such as the 'fraidy cat' who eventually makes good, the elder female relative (equally terrified), the sinister-looking old servant-woman devoted to her dead master, the innocent and put-upon heroine, etc.While the pace is somewhat slow (the plot really gets going during the second half), the film is tremendously entertaining all the way through; when I first watched it, I had felt that too much attention was given to the comic relief but this time around I saw the film's mixture of thrills and laughter as more evenly balanced (and the gags themselves not terribly archaic). With respect to the horror element, it's not so much to the fore - since the film is more of a thriller really; in fact, \"The Cat\" itself doesn't feature in it all that much, but there's no denying that it's a memorably ghoulish creation!The end credits themselves are quite amusing: reproducing the cast list (which would come to be a Universal trademark) so that patrons could cite those participants who had particularly pleased them - followed by a request by company President Carl Laemmle, urging the public to write to him personally with their opinion of the film! The score (which is a re-recording of the original accompaniment to the film) sounds awfully familiar and was probably re-used for other Silents or subsequent Universal horror films.Some years ago I had also watched the 1978 remake of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (surprisingly directed by Radley Metzger, better known for his ventures in Erotica!) and would love to get to the 1939 version which cemented Bob Hope's popularity and is, actually, as highly regarded as the original(!); unfortunately, it's only available in a reportedly atrocious print on Region 2 DVD...", "I always tend to get a bit soft and emotional when commenting on old films, such as the 1927 version of \"The Cat and the Canary\". Just imagine \u0085 85 years of age, this film is, and it still manages to find its way to new audiences. Everyone of the cast and crew is long dead and \u2013 to put it a bit less respectful \u2013 decomposed \u2013 but at least their legacy will live on for much longer than mine or yours (probably). \"The Cat and the Canary\" even still reaches fairly large new audiences, as I watched it in an artsy theater during a thematic festival and complete with musical guidance on the piano. Paul Leni's version of \"The Cat and the Canary\" isn't just the first of many adaptations of the famous stage play by John Willard, it also still stands as the ultimate and most prototypic Old Dark House horror. All the trademarks \u2013 commonly referred to as clich\u00e9s nowadays \u2013 can be found here in this trendsetter, and presumably for the first time ever: the reading of the will at midnight, the ominous housemaid, the mysteriously vanishing notary, the secret passageways in the library and behind the bed, the clumsy comic relief cousin \u2013 and yes \u2013 even the predictable identity of the maniacal killer on the loose. This film is a joy to behold, thanks to the splendid performances (particularly Tully Marshall as the stern notary, Martha Maddox as the creepy maid and Laura La Plante as the cherubic victim) and the atmosphere that is simultaneously frightful and light-headed! Through some imaginative camera angles, Leni generates and handful of spooky moments but the overall tone remains accessible for wider audiences. There are a few obvious holes in the plot (like for example the main heiress being too young for a testament that lingered around for two decades) but you will gladly overlook those. Silence is golden!", "I had seen The Cat and the Canary several times before I sat down to watch the Kino transfer. It has amazing clarity, a beautifully appropriate score, and does more than ample justice to one of the cornerstones of the silent era and the horror genre respectively. The story is simple enough: a wealthy man dies leaving his money to an heir detailed in a sealed envelope for all to see years after his death. We are introduced to the main star of the film early on - the eerie, creepy, web-strewn house. A house filled with long-flowing drapes, creaky(we must imagine) steps, mazes of twisting hallways, a series of hidden compartments and passageways all over, and the obligatory servant that hangs on to her job years after her employer has passed away. Director Paul Leni knows how to set the mood and make atmosphere reign supreme as his camera lens moves to shadows and light with the greatest of ease. The acting complements the atmosphere with great turns really by all involved. Tully Marshall, though in a small role, makes more impact with his little screen time than other actors would be capable of doing. Martha Mattox, as Mammy Pleasant of all names, is exceedingly creepy and effective as the old maid of the manse. Beautiful Laura LaPlante is the heiress who must spend a night amidst jealous, vengeful, greedy relatives. LaPlante has an exquisite smile and grace about her and effectively can go from light horror to light comedy. But Leni makes more than just a horror film here with Creighton Hale as Paul Jones, LaPlante's cousin and love interest. With Hale Leni relies heavily on mixing horror and atmosphere with broad light comedy. Hale, with his Harold Lloyd glasses and look, really is quite amusing as a bungling, easily frightened man who gets to relive his adolescent crush. The other actors are just dandy(seems to work in a review for a film this old) and the killer is not terribly hard to figure out - but that is secondary to the mood, tension, pace, and characterizations that lead to his/her unveiling. The Kino print is really just gorgeous. The music is just right and the title cards are perfect. Two scenes in particular stand out for me as classic Leni: One, Mattox, with candle in hand walking down a corridor with a row of windows draped and blowing as the winds blows indiscriminately and two, Tully Marshall about to read the name of the heir should LaPlante be proved to be crazy. Wonderfully shot! An ageless classic of the silent cinema for sure.", "Laura La Plante (as Annabelle West) and an assortment of greedy relatives gather at a Gothic Old Mansion to hear the reading of The Will. Relatively soon, we learn The Fortune will be inherited by young Ms. La Plante; however, she must be declared Sane by a doctor - naturally, this is an incentive for someone to drive the dear girl Insane!This is a stylishly shot silent \"comedy/thriller\" spoof of \"haunted house\" stories - like \"The Bat\" (a 1920 play, and 1926 movie). La Plante and Creighton Hale (as Paul Jones) are okay as the nominal \"leads\", but the veteran cast must have been much more amusing to the typical 1920s viewer. Tully Marshall (as Mr. Crosby) and Lucien Littlefield (as the Doctor) were two of the best supporting actors around, and Flora Finch (as Aunt Susan) must have been considered a film legend in 1927 - they are all a hoot, but Martha Mattox really steals the \"The Cat and the Canary\" with her terrific turn as haunted house hostess \"Mammy Pleasant\"!Interestingly, this was an adaptation of a (1922) stage play - oddly \"silent\" films made much better movies out of plays than did later \"sound\" adaptations. Some may argue \"sound\" productions never figured out how to turn a good stage play into a good movie. Director Paul Leni and Gilbert Warrenton were among those making art (more or less) out of silent film. By the way, there is a scene with the possible \"killer\" walking in from the right of the screen; but, this is not a \"who-done-it\" movie as much as it is a spoof of said******** The Cat and the Canary (9/9/27) Paul Leni ~ Laura La Plante, Creighton Hale, Martha Mattox, Flora Finch", "This has been restored by Kevin Brownlow and Photoplay Productions. The new print is beautiful and shows why Paul Leni was considered a master. Sure, the plot is slight, but Leni is so imaginative and unrestrained in his style that you just sit there with your mouth open in amazement. Most every shot is a masterpiece. The sets and photography are wonderful. There's way too much silly humor in it -- Leni's far more effective at the scary moments. But leading lady La Plante is effective; and the more ghoulish secondary roles are handled with relish. You wonder why most haunted house movies of the 30's and 40's didn't have this much style. They should have learned from the Master. I hope this restored version makes it out on DVD soon.", "An old man (Cyrus West) dies accusing his relatives of hovering over him--like cats over a canary. 20 years after his death his relatives get together as his will is read in his creepy mansion on a dark and windy night at midnight (of course). One person gets all the money and estate--unless they are proved insane. And how about the escaped lunatic from the nearby asylum...?This is probably one of the first (if not THE first) movie about the reading of the will, a dark and (purportedly) haunted house and people being murdered. Plotwise it's nothing new and contains some terribly unfunny \"comedy\". Still it's worth catching.It's very well directed by Paul Leni (the juxtaposing of images was clever) and he has fun with the title cards (see how \"HELP!\" is done). The acting is a little bit overdone (but that's common in silent films) and star Laura La Plante is pretty good. I saw the restored print (which is still in pretty bad shape) and it has an excellent music score that helps too.So, worth catching. No great shakes though.", "This is the stereotypical old dark house movie, all the relatives come to and old dark house and some one begins to kill them, or tries to. This has been remade several times, each version having its flaws and its strengths. This is the first version, and while I would like to say its the best, I can't since the silent medium has rendered its pace a bit too slow for modern audiences.This isn't to say that its a bad film. Its not. Anyone interested in film and what can be done with it should see this film because the first half of this movie is a treasure trove of cinema techniques. The first half is also a damn good movie as well since it wonderfully sets everything up. Only as things begin to follow there course does the pacing slow. Its far from bad, it just may have you look at your watch now and again.I give it seven out of ten, not perfect but watchable.", "When a lawyer arrives at the estate of a recently-deceased client for a reading of the will, he finds that there's a living moth inside the safe he sealed twenty years earlier. Clearly, something's not quite right in THE CAT AND THE CANARY. The ensuing attempts by various and sundry people to gain possession of the dead man's riches (by legally proving that the heiress is insane) leads to some classic Horror Movie moments (and images ingrained in many minds long ago by Forrest J. Ackerman's FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND)- moments that have been \"re-imagined\" a million times since. There's also a Harold Lloyd look-alike who has perhaps the best line in the movie. \"Don't interrupt me,\" he says at one point: \"I think I'm thinking.\" Besides these assets, THE CAT AND THE CANARY offers some amazingly MODERN filmmaking techniques (not to mention the greatest number of dissolves and super-impositions I think I've ever seen). It's called a classic for a reason.", "\"The Cat and the Canary\" has been considered a masterpiece, and that the film is still known today is a feat in itself. It is easily my favorite silent film. Paul Leni (the director) has a great deal of prowess on films like these, and it has been admitted by others.First, the sets are realistic, making this film a believable \"journey back in time\" (it was made over 70 yrs. ago). I am shocked to hear one reviewer say this film as broadly acted and visually stunted. The sets are marvelous, especially the drawing room (it looks very nice to be part of a \"haunted house\"). The camera work (ex. the skeleton double-exposure, the subtitles occasionally moving like a ghost) is very enjoyable, too.About the acting, first get this straight: Much of the acting is quite normal. But in the fright scenes (especially by Laura La Plante), the acting has nothing wrong with it. Much of it is very funny (contrary to common belief). Flora Finch (Aunt Susan) is funny as the gossiper, and Creighton Hale as Paul is cute. Why do most of you find the broad acting painful to watch? If you can't find silent films enjoyable, all I can tell you is, tough luck. Classic films are as a general rule better than the new ones, but even new films can be very good.", "German director Paul Leni seems, from my personal experience with his films, to be one of the more lighthearted directors to apply expressionist horror techniques to his films. At first glance this might make his films appear as somewhat routine, but there has to be something said for taking horrific subjects and turning them into comedy or adventure, as he's done here in this much-imitated mystery/suspense vehicle derived from the Broadway hit. He exists in roughly the same tradition as the French \"Grand Guignol\" -- the elaborate setup makes it possible for the audience to have fun with being \"chilled.\" In this case, we have what would today be a very standard haunted house situation. Relatives of an old man who went insane return to his mansion 20 years later to hear the reading of his Will. As part of the Will's conditions, the person receiving the inheritance (who turns out to be a character played by lovely Laura La Plante) must be adjudged sane by a doctor, so someone in the group is trying to drive her insane or make her appear insane so that they can win the money.It's very obvious to the audience from the beginning that there are no real ghosts, so the fun in the movie is largely watching the way that the characters are scared by the possibility. There is one character, played by Creighton Hale (who later made B movies for AIP and other companies) who is just completely there for comic relief, and yet he is also the only man in the movie who's sincere and wants to help Annabelle (La Plante). A lot of elements in the movie were probably clich\u00e9 already by the time it came out, but others were inventive.I didn't find the film visually as exciting as some other films in the same genre such as Roland West's \"The Bat\" or James Whale's \"The Old Dark House\". Also the performances are pretty much by rote. However there's just a kind of breeziness to the whole thing that makes it fun. And a couple of scenes were very well done visually, such as the scene with Annabelle's pearls being stolen. The use of the looming title card there would be an ideal example of how title cards were used to enhance film artistry rather than as a limitation. In fact that scene in particular very much reminded me of the way Alfred Hitchcock shot the very beginning of \"To Catch a Thief\" with the jewelry theft. None of the images are quite as disturbing today as those in Whale's and West's films.", "Cat and the Canary, The (1927)*** (out of 4)Classic \"old dark house\" film has an old man dying and then twenty-years later his relatives arrive at his creepy mansion for the will reading. The estate goes to Annabelle (Laura La Plante) as long as she is proved to be sane but throughout the night various visions of demons appear to her. Is she losing her mind or is someone just trying to scare her? One needs to remember that all the clich\u00e9 moments in this film weren't clich\u00e9 when this was originally released. So many films have since ripped this one off that one might forget how original this movie was when it was originally released. What really stood out after eighty-years is how brilliantly this thing looks on a technical level. The cinematography ranks as some of the greatest I've ever seen and there are countless moments that you could point to as being ground breaking. Even the opening title credits are downright breathtaking with the creepy hand moving the dust and spider webs away. The set design by Charles D. Hall is just as wonderfully done and adds to the overall atmosphere, which is very thick from start to finish. Not only does the film deliver many creepy moments but there's a nice mixture of laughs thrown in as well. I've read reviews that said there were too many laughs but I'd have to disagree with that as the laughs are kept rather low-key and never take away from the actual story. The middle section of the film moves a bit too slowly but all of that picks up towards the end. The characters really aren't well-written but that doesn't matter too much as the real entertainment comes from the visuals and the creepy atmosphere.", "I love watching movies from years ago, particularly silent films. Some are good, some I cannot finish. However, there are those films that are simply brilliant. The Cat and the Canary falls into the latter. I have watched this over and over and marvel at how real it seems. The viewer's post prior to this was accurate in everything she said. The sets were so realistic, I actually thought it was a real haunted house. My particular favorite scene is the opening, as the camera pans down the hallway, with the curtains blowing in the wind. Very ethereal, ghostly feel. As far as the acting, I could find no fault with any of it. This is simply a wonderful movie and is worth viewing again and again. I feel guilty only spending $5 for it.", "Twenty years after the death of Cyrus West, his remaining relatives come to his foreboding manor to hear the reading of the will. Cyrus leaves his estate (including the prized West Pearls) to his most distant relative, Annabelle West. The will also stipulates that Annabelle must be deemed sane by a doctor the following morning or she will forfeit the estate and it would be left to another of West's heirs whose named is sealed in an envelope. The person mentioned in the envelope starts a campaign to terrorize Annabelle and convince everyone else in the house that she is insane, including kidnapping the lawyer Crosby. Its up to Annabelle and her distant relative (and romantic interest) Paul uncover the guilty party. This film is a real treat for Old Dark House fans with plenty of suspense, thrills, and mystery to keep the audience in attention from beginning to end. The cast is non-descript with no one really stands out, but Leni's direction and Warrenton's cinematography create the exact mood the film needs. The film's drawbacks are Hale's characterization of Paul and the characters of Cecily and Aunt Susan, who become annoying to watch. Rating, 8.", "If, like me, you've heard this movie for years touted as one of the most influential silent horrors of all time, you may be a tad disappointed. As Mike Weldon points out in the `Psychotronic Video Guide,' midnight will-readings and creaky old houses were already old hat by the late twenties, and this film probably got as many giggles as shudders even in its day. Nevertheless, there are some nice camera-effects and decent sets, and for fans of the genre, it remains a must. A particularly noteworthy image is the chiming of the long-dead clock, with its innards superimposed upon the characters collected for the reading of the will.Plotwise, I was surprised firstly by the hero's (perhaps unwitting) resemblance to Harold Lloyd  - accentuated by the presence of `Haunted Spooks' at the end of the tape. Noticeably lacking, however, is Lloyd's irreverence and comic timing \u0096 this fellow just winds up being a comedy-relief dud, oddly reminiscent of the wanna-be adventurer from `Seven Footprints to Satan.' Even Lloyd's most clownish characters would not have missed the obvious romantic interest of the heroine, or failed to at least pretend to be macho in front of her (with the usual hilarious results). Our boy in `Canary,' however, seems to be entirely unaware of his opportunities.Without needing to give anything away, I was also a bit disappointed by the final revelation of `whodunit.' In fairness, that means I didn't manage to predict the perpetrator \u0096 but this was more because the film did not play fair and offer enough clues than because of its brilliant web of complexity. That certain characters are more than they would seem is obvious, and the primary `red herring' of the film is easily detected, but one needs a fuller appreciation of the motivations of our various suspects in order to make a reasoned guess. This is particularly important in a silent film, where so much has to be judged by facial expressions and visual cues.It would not be fair to place blame upon Paul Leni for the unfortunate score on the videotape, which was obviously composed by someone from the \"some guy with a Casio\" school of music.On the whole, however, `Cat and the Canary' has its place as a classic of the `spooky old house' genre, whether it invented the cliches or merely enhanced them, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to any viewer.", "I'm a fan of both horror films and silent films, but I didn't have a chance to get around to this one until now--and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Other reviewers have already indicated how well-directed it is, and some have pointed out that the \"overacting\" is intentional in what was always understood by 1927 audiences as a spoof of the \"Old Dark House\" genre that was popular on Broadway for much of the decade and spilled onto the movie screen. Once you understand that everyone KNEW these were cliches, you realize there's no reason to take a patronizing attitude. I have to say this is the most satisfying \"ODH\" film I've seen (not considering actual haunted house films like the first version of \"The Haunting\"). It has a light touch and almost every shot makes some delightful choice--moving camera, jarring close-up, dutch angle, etc. Director Leni succeeds in making this stage play seem cinematic. One shot has a frightened character speeding through the corridor, apparently on an unseen bicycle! The shot of the body falling down out of a closet onto the camera has been much imitated, both seriously (as in \"Public Enemy\") and as parody (Warner Bros. cartoons). For a quick comparison, check Roland West's early talkie \"The Bat Whispers.\" Although nothing in \"Cat\" reaches quite the level of West's most astonishing shots, the film as a whole is more satisfying and less stagey.", "During the course of this film, one of the characters utters the line \"Gosh, what a spooky house,\" and boy, does that line ever ring true! The original \"old dark house\" story, \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927) was based on a John Willard stage play of 1922 and has been filmed no less than four times as of this date. The film shows us what happens when a dead man's will is read in a creepy old house on the Hudson to a bunch of oddball relatives, one of whom, Laura LaPlante, inherits a fortune with the proviso that she passes a sanity test. And poor Laura's sanity IS put to the test that very night, what with an escaped madman on the loose, a possible ghost running around, hands coming out of the walls, mysterious disappearances, and a house full of secret passages, swing-out bookcases and so on. Despite some comedic bits that border on the inane but never quite cross that fine line, \"The Cat and the Canary\" is genuinely creepy in parts. It also features excellent photography, interesting camera angles, expressionistic and surrealistic backdrops, some blatant symbolism, fascinating use of superimposed images and an appropriately strange score. The dialogue cards are at times very imaginative, and this crisp-looking print has been nicely color tinted for our viewing pleasure. As usual in many silents, the comedic, cowardly character proves to be more than he initially appears. But I'm not giving anything away here; most viewers will never guess who the murderer/ess is in this film. It's a classic, historic winner, not at all creaky, and even suitable for the kiddies. I do recommend it.", "This is one of those must-see-at-least-once haunted house films, being one of the originals. I've seen it more than a few times. It took me years to track it down on VHS, nowadays it seems everywhere on digital platforms. It was very well done, a very pleasant comedy and well worth while and yet imho is nowhere near as good as the 1939 remake, that is if comparisons between silents and talkies are permitted. To me it's the same story therefore the two are comparable, although the 1979 version is probably best utterly forgotten if not completely forgivable for being such a time waster.Various quirky guests assemble at huge spooky mansion at midnight exactly 20 years after the death of their eccentric relative Cyrus West to hear the reading of his Will and who gets his money. It always struck me as odd that the greedy relatives didn't initially contest the bizarre rule, after all some of them might have joined him Upstairs in the intervening 2 decades! Creighton Hale and Laura La Plante played the lead characters of Paul and Annabelle excellently \u0096 but unfortunately without the same sparkle Bob Hope and Paulette Godard had when playing Wally and Joyce 12 years later. However, the 1927 version had some nifty camera-work, inventive intertitles, some witty moments (especially Aunt Susan encountering the wide eyed Paul under her bed!) and nice sets with a lovely atmosphere that all still manages to suck you completely into the plot. I would add that the version I just saw ran 93 minutes with a rather stale soundtrack, I thought the tape I watched in the '90's was more sympathetic at 126 minutes long - there's apparently a wide range of versions now available on DVD so a little care in choosing seems required. As I'm still searching for the Perfect Copy this applies to me too!All in all an enjoyable and essential silent film to see even if you don't like the genre; if you do then I would particularly recommend the remake as one of the best films ever made.", "The version I watched on Amazon was the one issued by Kino with the music score intact. This was quite both a scary and funny movie with Creighton Hale a hoot as the comic hero. This must have been one of the early movies in which a group stays at a haunted house after a reading of a will and the one who stands to inherit it all is the one who gets almost scared of his/her wits. This is the kind of plot I used to regularly watch on \"Scooby Doo\" cartoons on Saturday mornings when a kid during the '70s. Anyway, I quite enjoyed this silent version of something I watched a talkie version of years back-the one with Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard from 1939. So yeah, that's a recommendation of this version of The Cat and the Canary."], "tt0017947": ["Ralph Spence wrote his play 'The Gorilla' in the mid-1920s, when Broadway audiences had already seen several dead-earnest thriller plays about spooky old houses full of trapdoors and masked villains. The posters for the 1925 Broadway production of 'The Gorilla' acknowledged its predecessors, by ballyhooing: 'Out-bats \"The Bat\"! Out-cats \"The Cat and the Canary\"! Out-warns \"The Last Warning\"!' What made 'The Gorilla' a hit onstage was the fact that it spoofed the cliches of spooky-house plays while managing to be somewhat scary on its own merits, much as 'Arsenic and Old Lace' would be a few years later.The various film versions of 'The Gorilla' downplay the thriller elements, replacing them with lowbrow slapstick comedy ... thus rendering a wildly improbable storyline even more implausible. Fortunately, the 1927 silent film (the first screen version) is quite funny, although it deviates considerably from Spence's play. Sour old miser Cyrus Townsend (played by sour old character actor Claude Gillingwater) is murdered. There are several suspects, since Cyrus had many enemies ... including his brother Uriah (Tully Marshall). Cyrus's daughter (beautiful black-haired Alice Day) decides to solve her dad's murder. For some reason, the leading suspect is a gorilla, who appears to have wandered in from the street. (As gorillas do.) Or could it be that the gorilla is a murderer in a gorilla suit? Maybe there are TWO gorillas: a real one, and one in a costume...The plot makes no sense at all, but this movie is enjoyable in a demented way. Veteran comic Charlie Murray (a former Keystone Cop) steals the show as a dim-witted detective. The funniest scene has Murray tiptoeing through the spooky house in search of the gorilla, unaware that the gorilla is tiptoeing along directly behind him! This is the sort of routine that Lou Costello did later, but it's much funnier as Murray does it ... and the silent film gives Murray an advantage over Costello. (In a silent film, we don't wonder why the comedian doesn't hear the gorilla tiptoeing behind him.)Eventually, virginal damsel Alice Day ends up in the clutches of the gorilla. Just so we get the symbolism, Alice wears a diaphanous white outfit in this scene that makes her look very virginal. The photography and direction are excellent, and there are some impressively creepy scenes centred in a spiral staircase worthy of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'.HERE COMES THE SPOILER RIGHT NOW. Handsome young Walter Pidgeon, who is so helpful to sweet Alice, turns out to be the dastardly villain. Interestingly, Pidgeon was also in the 1930 remake of 'The Gorilla', although in a different role. I'll rate this silent version 9 points out of 10, despite its wild implausibility."], "tt0018097": ["... using production stills, the shooting script, and a score by Robert Israel. I am rating the reconstruction's ability to recreate the mood and story of the film, as the film itself is lost. It's a noticeable loss, since MGM has a better record of preserving their silent film heritage than any other studio.Even though it is a sought after prize among lost films, it was poorly reviewed in its day. Reviewers praised Lon Chaney's performance and makeup, but thought that the script was a bit of a mess, with the central mystery being poorly resolved. And from watching the reconstruction, I have to agree.Roger Balfour is found shot to death in his home, with an investigator arriving fifteen minutes after his death (Lon Chaney as Edward Burke) , without even being summoned. He begins to question everybody in the house - Balfour's daughter, Lucille (Marceline Day), Balfour's good friend Sir James Hamlin (Henry Walthall), Hamlin's nephew Arthur Hibbs (Conrad Nagel), and Williams, Balfour's butler (Percy Williams). A suicide note is found near the body, and the death ruled as such.Five years later, and apparently Lucille Balfour has moved elsewhere, with the Balfour mansion in overgrown ruins. This is where Chaney's vampire character with the hideous teeth enters the picture. He actually signs a lease for the property, along with a younger looking female vampire. Shortly thereafter, Roger Balfour, apparently now a vampire, is living on the old Balfour estate with the two other vampires. Burke and Hamlin investigate and find Roger Balfour's tomb empty. Complications ensue.I immediately recognized this plot as the same one as that for 1935's \"Mark of the Vampire\", also directed by Tod Browning. That one also has huge plot holes, but at least the victim there does not die from a gunshot wound and then inexplicably become a vampire. Neither does it have a vampire signing a lease and partaking in commerce. Had he not paid the rent would they have evicted a vampire? I will give the original this - the 1935 remake required two legendary actors - Lionel Barrymore AND Bela Lugosi - to replace just one legendary actor - Lon Chaney.Today, Lon Chaney is the best known member of the cast. Marceline Day, top billed next to Chaney, was a big star in her time but sound apparently washed out her career, although her voice was fine. After she left Hollywood she would never watch or even discuss her films again.", "Hey, wait!! Hold it a second, guys....how can a film unseen by the general public for 75 years get any User Ratings? Granted, there may be some seniors around who saw the film as children, but are they the ones rating this film on IMDb? Or, are these merely false ratings made by silent film fans based on the reputations of Chaney and Browning and the existence of some tantalizing surviving stills from the film?I think we need a reality check here: this film is lost, folks, and it's going to stay lost. All efforts to flush a print out of hiding have failed, including those of Turner, who owns the rights and have the most to gain by the film's recovery. (TCM will broadcast a stills-only re-creation of the film in October '02. Translation? Even the rightful owners of the film have given up hope! Does this tell you anything?) And, yes, while someone may have a print in a private collection, or in their attic, etc., it's a real longshot.Don't get me wrong; the loss of this film is lamentable in the extreme. (The loss of any film is lamentable. The loss of any SILENT film is most lamentable. The loss of any CHANEY film is truly awful. And, the loss of any Chaney film featuring the coolest vampire get-up EVER is unspeakably awful!!!) But, I believe film fans need to let go of this one and move on. The reputations of Chaney and Browning will survive without this film. I believe our energies would be better spent putting pressure on archives and film libraries to release their long-held treasures to the viewing public, as there is a huge amount of silent material that HAS survived, but which goes unseen by all but scholars and the privileged few.", "London After Midnight...the very mention of this lost film brings to mind all of the other outstanding performances of the greatest ACTOR that ever lived, Lon Chaney. It has been suggested by some that Lon was only an O.K. actor, and that he let his makeups do most of his acting for him. Nothing could be further from the truth. The talent of this man is immeasurable. Yes, his makeups helped to bring his characters to life, but it didn't define them. His ACTING inspired pity in Quasimodo, the Phantom, and others.I hope someday London After Midnight does show up so Lon's detractors can eat their words. If you are unable to look beyond the greasepaint, putty, false teeth, and wigs, and see a truly remarkable characterization, the fault is yours, not his. Having seen every one of his films that survive, (nearly twenty) I can tell you that some of his most unforgettable roles used little or no makeup at all! Try watching Tell It To The Marines or The Penalty and see what you think...Lon Chaney shall NEVER die! He will live in the hearts of his fans forever.", "The Turner Classic Movies recreation of this \"lost\" classic was unbelievably well done. The Recreation using still photos was close to experiencing it on film. The music was well suited to the theme. I sincerely hope that a print of this classic exists somewhere so that it can be seen.", "As of October 20, 2007, \"London After Midnight\" is a lost film - there is no known surviving footage. Hopefully, a print or portion will be discovered. Until then, TCM's 2002 reconstruction, by Rick Schmidlin, will have to suffice - it was created by referencing the original script and utilizing movie photograph stills. Robert Israel provided a representative musical score. Cheers to all involved!Before viewing the restoration by Mr. Schmidlin, consider watching the other Tod Browning (director), Lon Cheney (actor), and Merritt B. Gerstad (cameraman) collaboration \"The Unknown\" (1927); it may provide the best indication of how \"London After Midnight\" might have looked on the motion picture screen. Then, see Browning's re-make \"Mark of the Vampire\" (1935); its script closely follows \"London After Midnight\", and it will help explain some story elements limited by the movie stills available.I'm speculating the performances of Lon Chaney (as Prof. Edward Burke) and Henry B. Walthall (as Sir James Hamlin) were noteworthy, but the story disappointing. Conrad Nagel (as Arthur Hibbs) must have been very impressive; he would shortly co-star with none other than Greta Garbo, in 1928 and 1929 films. And, certainly, Marceline Day was lovely (as Lucille Balfour).******* London After Midnight (12/3/27) Tod Browning ~ Lon Chaney, Henry B. Walthall, Conrad Nagel", "\"London After Midnight\" is a combination mystery film and vampire movie. Lon Chaney plays dual roles--a detective as well as a crazed vampirey guy. Five years after a supposed suicide, weird ghouls move into the dead man's house--and the detective returns to investigate. At the end, the mystery is finally solved--though exactly how all this is proved is baffling--like there is either something missing or it just had a HUGE plot hole.I won't give this film a numerical rating, as the film no longer exists--at least not in any known archive. Turner Classic Movies recently showed what purported to be \"London After Midnight\" and I saw it on a DVD with \"The Unknown\" but it was a strange reconstruction--a film that should have been left lost if you ask me. Using the original intertitles and LOTS of stills from the movie, they attempted to re-create the film--without any actual film! Now I am a die-hard lover of silents and especially love the films of Lon Chaney, but this sort of reconstruction is simply ridiculous. It just isn't THE original film nor is it even a truncated version--it's a bizarre attempt to recreate the film from nothing--totally bizarre. To give the film a sense of movement, the camera moves about the stills--but again, these are just stills! And so, the film is lifeless--with no more energy than simply reading the screenplay. I say with such re-creations it's best to just leave them alone and put your energy into piecing together films with PORTIONS missing--not the entire film! I've seen such re-creations (such as Frank Capra's \"Lost Horizon\") and since the missing portions are filled in with stills for only tiny portions, it's very acceptable. This one, in my opinion, was a HUGE mistake and not worth your time.", "Personally, I'm grateful that the elegant B&W production stills survived in order that we can see what Tod Browning's production might have looked like had it not been destroyed by fire.It also helps if you've seen Browning's remake of this same story called THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE ('35) with its surprise ending being made much clearer than it is in this reconstruction where there is only one caption that even hints at what was going on with the theatrics.I was captivated by the dark-haired beauty of MARCELINE DAY and appalled at the silent histrionics of CONRAD NAGEL who wore the same look of horror and disbelief in every shot. The ending was blunted without giving a full explanation for any of the doings, which is why seeing the '35 version is advisable for anyone who is still confused.The '35 version had BELA LUGOSI, LIONEL ATWILL and LIONEL BARRYMORE in key roles and was extremely well worth viewing. This silent version, reconstructed with stills, appeared to be beautifully photographed with appropriately cobweb-covered interiors and intense B&W lighting for atmospheric effects.Chaney's make-up appeared to be quite startling--for me it was even more so than his \"Phantom\" disguise--and his Inspector Burke seemed a very forceful creation judging from the intense finger waving stills.Well done reconstruction except for the weak ending which missed making its point. The background score was fine.", "It's sad to say, I would probably not know much about this movie had it not been reconstructed. I did not know it was a lost \"classic\" (with mixed reviews). That's one of the reasons why I love projects like this so much, they help manifest the place in movie history some lost movies deserve. Another reason why I like projects like these, is that they give you the thrill of getting as close as possible to seeing something considered lost. Even though it's readily available, it feels somehow exclusive. (Oh, the vanity!) Even though they managed to piece the surviving stills and title cards together in an impressive coherent way, I still did struggle to follow the plot at times. Still, I prefer it over trying to recreate motion by editing the stills, as that can easily seem silly. I did figure out the plot by the end of it, and must say that I was not that impressed by it, but it has its charm. Playing with the ideas of vampires, hypnosis and murder is always fun, to some degree. The highlight to me was probably Cheney's make up. In the close up on some of the stills you can see how he achieved those eyes, for instance.So, my high rating of this movie is not because of the inherit quality of the movie itself, but they enjoyment of watching a restoration of it.", "The presentation of the still pictures (not the movie) lead to evaluate that presentation. I don't know if this movie was ever a good one, but I imagined it from Chaney's expressions (and those teeth) to be quite entertaining. So much takes place in talky drawing rooms and focuses on men with guns, roaming around. But we do get the interesting expressions of the actors and actresses and from experience with the genre, make some determinations about mood. Sad that we shall never see this. Sad that that fire destroyed so many silent films.", "To those who think that Chaney was just an OK actor, sadly have no clue what they are talking about. To make a statement such as he let his makeup do his acting also do not know that one of his most famous roles as the drill Sergeant in \"Tell It To The Marines\".The role earned him a honorary status among the Corp. So not only was Chaney a master of make-up, earning him the title of a man of a thousand faces, but also that of an exceptional actor with a range of emotions that could flash across his face that would later inspire the likes of Burt Lancaster to state \"one of the most compelling and emotionally exhausting scenes I have ever seen an actor do.\" Lancaster was referring to the scene from \"the Unknown\" in which Chaney portrayed an armless knife thrower in love with a young Joan Crawford.To say make up was his \"gimmick\",is ignorant at best, it was more of an extension of the man and the actor. For Chaney didn't limit himself to just one area, physically he performed acts that would later bring him a place in film history such as the con artist that fakes being crippled to be healed by a charlatan in the \"Miracle Man.\" The scene had people swearing that Chaney was a contortionist or double jointed, when in fact it is more a credit to his acting skills. Also in the \"Penalty\", he actually had a harness that he wore to bind his legs behind him and tucked into leather stubs. The pain allowed him only to wear the harness for fifteen minutes at a shoot, but Chaney insisted no trick photography be used. In \"The Unknown\", he had his arms bound up in a harness as well, you only have to watch the film to see not only the weird twist the movie takes, but also Chaney's cleverness.Lon Chaney died at the age of 47. It is ironic that his last movie was a \"talkie\", a remake of the silent classic \"The Unholy Three\" in which he did more than one voice. That of an old woman, a parrot and a ventriloquist. He proved to audiences that he was more than capable of transcending silent to sound.At his death production was stopped at Hollywood to observe a moment of silence, the Marine Corp flew their flag at half staff. Wallace Berry flew over his funeral and dropped wreaths of flowers. He said, \"Lon Chaney was the one man I knew who could walk with kings and not lose the common touch.\"", "From the day that the supposedly 'last' surviving copy of the movie was destroyed in a fire in the 60s, movie fans remained deprived of one of the GREATEST gems the horror-mystery genre had ever produced - until it was wonderfully restored in 2002, with very cleverly arranged scene stills and a very atmospheric music score. Now, watching this masterpiece of film restoration, you've REALLY got the feeling that you're actually watching the movie itself...And it shows clearly that this early example of the classic mystery movie was almost MORE than perfect in every way: the atmosphere of the old mansion (complete with vaults, cobwebs, ancestors' portraits and bats hanging from the ceiling) would become kind of a basis for all the films of the genre - and was probably only equaled in Browning's other unique masterpiece, the one and only \"Dracula\"...The narration technique (using flashbacks) was quite modern for the time, as well as the police methods depicted: even hypnotism was used to solve this 'horror' mystery - a feature which would also be 'borrowed' from many a movie of the genre's Classic era in the 30s...And, of course, we can see the actors (even through the scene stills) at their VERY best - especially Lon Chaney, who is simply fabulous as the horrifying, devilishly grinning creature; with THIS make-up, he'd even have scared 'Nosferatu' Max Schreck himself! A really GREAT experience for every real fan of the genre, and a lesson for film specialists: it shows how even a 'lost' film can almost be 'put together' again with the help of scene stills - a really ADMIRABLE piece of work done by the experts from the USC and the AMPAS!", "I thought I saw this one as a very little kid (between 3 to 5 years old) - but it was not. I think what I am remembering are the photos of the film on television and maybe some commentary on the film but not the film itself.I will say it is a shame the original film is burnt - but I can say I have seen the wonderful recreation of the movie. It is worth watching if you love silent films. OK so we only see still shots (photos) instead of the actors moving but the pictures work well because it is a silent film.I finally watched the recreation of the film and over the last 2 or 3 years I have had people look at me as if I was crazy when I told them I saw \"London After Midnight\" -- but they must have never seen what I saw - this awesome version of the film. Maybe they don't know this exists.If you enjoyed this silent film then I do recommend 'Phantom of the Opera' and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' both starring the incredible Lon Chaney, Sr. 9/10", "I enjoyed the reconstruction, for what it was. Of course, its sound remake - MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (1935) - is a very good indication of what London AFTER MIDNIGHT (1927) must have looked like.The plot is unbelievably contrived but let's not forget that the films adhere more to the style of 'old dark house' thrillers, then in vogue, than the typical 'vampire' film (that said, Chaney's vampire make-up is terrific and I'd love to see it in action!). It's interesting, however, to note how Browning was able to adapt himself with the times: in \"London\" the emphasis seems to be on grotesquerie (witness also Edna Tichenor's death-like pallor), since the archetype of the sub-genre during the Silent era was obviously NOSFERATU (1922); when MARK came along, Browning went for a more streamlined look - a suave Lugosi abetted by a sexy Carol Borland - spearheaded by his own landmark take on the Stoker classic! I also prefer the remake's change-of-setting (Hungary instead of London) and the blood-draining device to dispose of the victim (rather than the conventional 'suicide' of the original), thus giving credence - initially at least - to the vampires' presence in the film in the first place!", "\"London After Midnight\" is one of those films that has sparked a lot of debate and discussion over the years.In all likelihood, this movie will never be recovered but the reconstruction that was provided by \"Turner Classic Movies,\" provides a good idea as to how the film looks.Lon Chaney gives a truly frightening and un- nerving make-up job as the fake vampire. It is hard to judge how good a performance he gives but I'll wager it was very good - as he usually was.This film was remade in 1935 as \"Mark of the Vampire\" (also directed by Tod Browning).", "_London After Midnight_ was Lon Chaney's first and only foray into the vampire subgenre.  Directed by longtime collaborator Tod Browning (of _Dracula_ and _Freaks_ fame), _London_ featured a twist ending which many contemporary viewers found unsatisfying.Unfortunately, it is impossible for modern-day viewers to effectively judge the film as there is not a print known to exist.  What we do know about the film comes from its plethora of publicity stills (which have been reconstructed into a filmbook by Philip J. Riley), Browning's remake, _Mark of the Vampire_ (which is allegedly a shot-by-shot imitation), and the recollections of those who saw the film decades ago, like the legendary Forrest J. Ackerman.The general consensus is that, though Chaney's makeup is typically excellent, the film was only mediocre and its lost status is no great blow to film history.  That being said, it is certain that the rediscovery of this film would send hundred of movie buffs into an absolute frenzy.  As the IMDB says, \"Check your attic!\"", "and was totally disappointed. Dull, long (even at 50 minutes) and just the same stills over and over again. Since TCM released this, I think it's safe to say that no prints of this film exist at all (unless some private collector has it and isn't saying a word). What I did see didn't impress me in the least...and that horrible ending! \"Mark of the Vampire\" was a (sort of) remake and much much better (even with the ending). I do applaud TCM for doing this, but I honestly didn't like the results. So, my advice is to stick with \"Mark...\". Also I remember seeing a documentary about this ages ago (sorry--I don't remember the title) and they talked to one senior citizen who remembered seeing the film as a child. She said when you first got a good look at Chaney in that wild vampire makeup the audience laughed! That aside she said the movie was pretty bad and no one liked the ending. So maybe it's a good thing that this is lost.", "WE RECENTLY HEARD a rumor that a print of this film has surfaced somewhere here on Planet Earth. If this be true, we all can certainly rejoice and be thankful. The last copy is said to have self-destructed some years ago. Well, as our Jewish friends say: \"From your lips to God's ears!\"WE DO CONFESS that what we have just witnessed was a recreation of the movie that used stills, clever moving camera techniques and some appropriately atmospheric music to give the World at least a facsimile of just what this Todd Browning-Lon Chaney collaboration looked like on screen. The stills that were pressed into service, like all production related photos, are probably a trifle more dramatic than would be the actual scenes. Some also tended to deviate from the actual story; being done that way as to make them good for Lobby Cards and Movie Posters.HOWEVER, WE DIGRESS! Being that the existing photos are all that the production team of this restoration/representation were able to press into service, there is little room for neither complaint nor \"advice\" on just how they should have done it. We do give our \"Hat's Off\" to them for what we now possess.AS FOR THE story, it is very well mounted and the sets are convincingly spooky and definitely \"Vampire-like\". The action moves along at a breezy, yet well paced clip. Time is taken to carefully establish characters, relationships and any motives that one would have to have been the murderer.IF THIS SOUNDS like a sort of drawing room murder mystery, that's because it is fundamentally conformed to that particular genre. But it also has elements of what has come to be known as \"The Old Dark House\" school of thrillers. The elements are there.OF COURSE, WITH the subject matter being that of an infestation of Vampires in the definitely upscale London Suburban neighborhood, we have always put the pigeon-holing in the category of a Fright Film. This would make the story, scenario and the film itself in the position of \"Hard to Categorize.\"BEING THAT THIS is a silent and came out for release about three years before Dracula (Universal, 1931), its vampyr lore is somewhat different from that which has become a sort of pseudo-mythology for vampires/vampyrs, lychanthropes (werewolves) and man-made electronically re-animated dead tissue creatures (Frankenstein). It was refreshing to have some references to \"the undead\" that dates to the 18th Century. Also there is some deviant \"facts\" about the Vamp's daytime slumbering habits.IN SOME REAL life and behind the scenes oddities, we find many coincidental facts that parallel both London AFTER MIDNIGHT and Dracula.FIRST OF ALL, both films were directed by Todd Browning. Vampires, as a subject matter, were central to both stories. Although it was Mr. Lon Chaney who was planned to have the title-role of Dracula in the movie, his untimely and somewhat premature death removed him from us before he could fulfill that assignment. It went instead to Mr. Bela Lugosi; who had portrayed the Transylvanian Count on stage.FINALLY, THE SCREENPLAY was adapted to the movies from a story titled \"The Hypnotist\" which was written by Director Browning, himself. This would seem to mean that the treatment that was the final product was done up as it was intended.WE ALSO DISCOVERED that Director Todd Browning was full of the devil and did not mind fooling us a little, or even a lot! Isn't that right, Schultz?", "It is really too painful to watch this movie substitute, too painful if you are interested in old silent era classics, too painful to realize that so many other films are lost too. It is useless to have amassed those ashes, yes ashes, that's the way I describe this, those pictures. What the use, rub salt in the wound? This film seemed so much terrific, if you consider the topic. I prefer stopping now, because it is too painful to continue.", "London After Midnight (1927)This is not so much a review as an attack. And even then, the attack is not a hostile one. I'm not one to attack a movie without what I feel is a worthy reason. The only movies that even come to mind that I've attacked in writing are Bad Boys II and the recent Sex and the City movie, though that extends to the show as well. Personally, I found Bad Boys II offensive on nearly every conceivable level, so I attacked it. I despise the shameless embrace of materialism in Sex and the City. I think that show at one time was a satire, but just got too lazy to make the effort at cleverness, and instead wallowed gleefully it its shallow pool.Those attacks were hostile. My reason for Attacking London After Midnight is not so much an attack on the film in and of itself, but an attack on the \"reconstruction\" of the film - the only way to see it today. The film opened to mixed reviews, yet was director Tod Brownings and Lon Chaney's most financially successful work. But then the only remaining print of the film was destroyed by fire in 1967. It's now on the AFI's lost films list, and has garnered something of an illustrious reputation and following. There are rumors that another print, fully intact exists, but this reconstruction is the only version available. It was reported as \"the closest to the original version we'll see.\" Maybe that is so, maybe the rumors of an intact print are just that. Although many are grateful that this reconstruction exists to give them a glimpse at a lost film, when it comes down to it, this version is nothing that cannot be matched looking at a google image search, playing ominous music on windows media player, and reading from a transcript. What I'm trying to say is that this is nothing but an only kind of slick 45 minute power point presentation. It consists entirely of still photographs, panned and zoomed upon with intermittent title cards. Now, while I think this is a fairly ambitious and interesting attempt at a reconstruction, it's nevertheless just a summary from someone else's point of view, Rick Schmidlin's. He famously reconstructed Greed and Touch of Evil, and he did win an award for London After Midnight. It's my opinion though that while this is an admirable attempt, its also a misguided attempt. It's simply a curiosity project for those who have been waiting patiently to hear of a found copy of a movie that was by most accounts only mediocre. I can't make that judgment, because I still haven't seen the movie, just an elaborate photo summary of it.Now this is not to say that still images cannot make films (lets face it, its just still images flickered through light 24 times a second), and I would direct you to my impressions of La Jetee. But La Jetee's style was Chris Marker's intent for his film, but it wasn't Tod Browning's intent for London After Midnight. Browning had his own style, and moved and shot with his camera in particular ways for particular reasons. By reducing his direction to static images removes him from director and replaces him as set photographer. In a way, it's almost a rape of the directors work. Not intentional, of course, though.My \"attack\" is this: this reconstruction brings me no closer to having seen the film. I only have an idea of how it went. Sure I know a bit more about it and how it looked than before, but its just tantamount to preview research. Hence, no rating. Not zero stars, simply no rating, because, simply, I never got to see the real movie.Was it a waste of 45 minutes? My time, yes. Your time? Depends on your predilections, I suppose. Maybe this is not so much an attack then as a warning or disclaimer akin to those found on hazardous products. If you expect a real view of a lost film, you're likely to be annoyed that you only get to glimpse through archives, and be left sour. That might not be good for your health.", "I could care less that I'll get mucho negative helpful ratings for this input, but I thought this story was horrible. Very very minor. Of course I did not see the actual film, I saw the photo restoration on TCM but I mean c'mon, maybe this was just way over my head, but I have no idea what the point of the vampires was in the first place. This is a standard murder (?) mystery, was the guy in the beginning actually dead and replaced by an actor in the theater group? I am actually clueless about the whole point of this mess and the waiting FIVE YEARS thing, it's really a complete mess. Yeah I got into Chaney, anyone watching this is here for that reason, but the whole thing concerning the story was horrible. I much preferred the Cat and the Canary, no Chaney but that was a fun flick that pretended to be a horror flick just like this one does, except it was kind of coherent. If your looking for Chaney stick to something else or see it on TCM so you can say you know what it's about, strictly a mindless entertainment film for box office results.", "London After Midnight (1927) :\nBrief Review -It's difficult to judge a lost and reconstructed film, and TCM put me through a tough job. Nevertheless, it's an experience to review a tranquil movie. Despite mixed reviews from contemporary critics, London After Midnight emerged as the biggest hit for Tod Browning and Lon Chaney. Both being giants in their fields, the magic was inevitable. London After Midnight is a smoky flick for today, or for anyone who hasn't seen it in theatres since then. It's sad that one of the most sought-after lost films was burned. TCM's reconstruction is not a motion picture at all. The stills and intertitles can give you an idea of the story, the characters, the settings, and the screenplay, but they don't make a \"movie\". It is tough to judge such a film because you don't see actors acting; you don't feel the tension, the atmosphere, or anything else that's not moving. It becomes soulless, but still. I'd like to talk about the script and the storytelling. I won't talk about acting, assuming that Lon Chaney must have done the best job, just like he was doing in almost every film at the time, and that Browning must have done fine work, just like he was doing back then. There will be a lot of assumptions here, but that won't reflect on my final ratings. So, it's a bang-on script with thrilling suspense and some frightening horror images. The killer's identity is pretty suspenseful, and you'd be surprised to know the way it unfolds. That hypnotism trick is mesmerising for its time and the way it is used as the main element to solve a murder mystery. The bats and those horrendous eyes will scare the hell outta you. But sadly, these are just images, and motion would have definitely felt more frightening. Browning's guts to go against mainstream formulas does the trick again, and nobody could have used Chaney better than him.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.", "I have been a fan of Lon Chaney since I first saw clips of him in The Phantom of the Opera (1925) on the TV show Muppet Babies and since I have become a huge fan of Phantom of the Opera, I also became a fan of Chaney. I have seen only three of his films, The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), The Phantom of the Opera (1925/29), and He Who Gets Slapped (1925). And I must say when I heard of London After Midnight I was intensely interested in this film purely cause of Lon being in it (being a strict Roman Catholic and not loving horror films) and I thought I'd see it. I saw the documentary on Lon and I quite enjoyed it. Truly he was the master of makeup, but his most terrifying makeup is this role as the Vampire/Inspector Burke. I heard the reviews on it and though they all agreed his makeup was terrific and his acting well done, the film was a bomb. So when TCM played the Restoration of the film using photos, I jumped for it. And I must say, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did Phantom and Hunchback. But indeed the makeup IS terrific and the most frightening out of any vampire makeup I have ever seen. Primitive stuff and he managed to turn his rugged good looking face into a truly horrific thing. I also enjoyed Marceline Day in the film, she was quite beautiful and is said to be a wonderful actress (she has recently passed on). But Lon is the star and I must say as poor as the film is, Lon did as usual a fantastic job. And wouldn't you believe it?? His own box which he created all his monsters and characters with (his makeup box) is at the end of the film. I found that rather touching in a way. But other than those things the film is too erratic and fantastic and hardly makes sense. But it is a good film in that Chaney created yet another fantastic makeup, but other than that, the film itself, despite Chaney and Day, was a bomb. But it was interesting to see Lon in this film and I still watch it as a reference that I saw it. But I truly think this is not his better films.", "AND I'M STILL WAITING!  Turner Classic Movies finally laid the first rotten egg of the restorations.  This \"redux\" of the Tod Browning film starring Lon Chaney is nothing more than filmed stills. I basically was treated to a very badly done slide show.  Remember Tod Browning had a certain style with his vampire films. When another person tries to show you how the movie might have looked with stills, you're getting ANOTHER PERSON'S VIEW OF THE STORY.  This didn't hit me like a Tod Browning in the least. People will probably hate me for this review, but I don't care. I give this slop 1/2 a star.", "this film has been edited in photo stills and a copy of the original script by rick schmidlin and was aired on tcm on halloween night 2002. i think he did a great job on it. well, i saw the stills version on halloween night in 2002 and it was enjoyable for 50 minutes, which is the only way we will see the film, because the last known print of the film known to exists was burnt up in vault #7 at the mgm studio in 1967 and since then no prints were found and it was on the a.f.i.  lost films list in 1980 along with \"cleopatra(1917)\",edison's \"frankenstein(1910)\", \"little red riding hood(1922)\", \"greed(1925)\" and many others. i never saw his stills version of \"greed(1925)\" or his remastered version of \"touch of evil\" ,but i did see his special edition of \"elvis: that's the way it is(1970)\". i did.'t see tod browning's remake of london after midnight which starred bela lugosi as the vampire and he called the remake \"mark of the vampire(1935)\". i read at some website that a copy of london after midnight was found at some farm house (no folling), the farmer showed the film to the studio and they said they will release it on vhs and dvd, but it will be delayed until 2022, because the film is damaged a little bit, because the it was under a chicken's nest for god knows how long. well if you want to e-mail me for more information, just send me a e-mail.", "Reviewers can pontificate as much as they like about whether this is, or not, a good or bad film, but it's all guesswork as none of you seem to have seen it and are only basing your opinions on second hand accounts. I imagine that, if in the possible event a copy of 'London after midnight' was found, we would all be thrilled to bits. What our opinions would be after that would be anyone's guess. As to the TCM reconstruction, how would you have done it? The studio stills are presumably all that is available to work with. I too was frustrated, but mainly because I can't see the actual film.

Playing the armless wonder in a gypsy circus, Chaney's face is a casebook of emotions as he longs for the chieftain's daughter. After making a tremendous, indeed, outrageous, sacrifice for her, he discovers it is all an utter waste. Chaney's agony is horribly apparent as he feels his life crumble around him. The actor uses his superb physical conditioning to great effect, his feet as facile as any hands--the extreme punishment undergone to play the part enormously impressive.In an important early film role, Joan Crawford is both sultry & disarming as the object of Chaney's desires; her intense neurotic phobia concerning men's hands certainly makes her character more interesting. Norman Kerry is affable & tender as the circus strong man who also loves Crawford. John George as Chaney's dwarf accomplice and Nick De Ruiz as the brutal circus chief are quite effective in their colorful roles.MGM gave the film fine production values, especially in the circus scenes--a milieu dear to Chaney's heart.", "The Unknown is one of the more interesting Lon Chaney collaborations with director/writer Tod Browning, as Chaney's typically physically malleable performance is often executed here in conjunction with \"stunt double\" Peter Dismuki. It also features a great, early appearance by Joan Crawford, a complex, gripping, allegorically deep but economically told story by Browning, and it is an excellent instantiation of themes found throughout Chaney and Browning's other work. It even strongly presages Browning's 1932 film, Freaks.Chaney is Alonzo the Armless, a performer in Antonio Zanzi's circus. Alonzo is in love with Nanon (Crawford), Antonio's daughter and Alonzo's assistant in his act, which consists of him using his feet to shoot guns and throw knives around Nanon with precision aim. In a typical Chaney film complicated love triangle, Nanon and Zanzi Circus strongman Malabar are also attracted to each other, but Nanon has an aversion to being touched and keeps distancing Malabar and any other man who wants to be intimate.Alonzo is the perfect complement for Nanon then, since he cannot manhandle her. She feels safe with him. But Antonio objects to Alonzo's approaches towards Nanon. Complex confrontations and a number of fabulous twists ensue, and Chaney fans will likely expect the resultant profound tragedy with the reciprocally bittersweet \"happy ending\" consequences.I probably made that synopsis sound more soap-operatic than it should, since it doesn't very well convey the overall twisted, creepy atmosphere that Browning achieves in The Unknown. Like Freaks, this isn't exactly a horror film, but it has all the unsettling, macabre attitude of one. Alonzo is one of Chaney's more demented, sinister characters, as almost every move he makes has a nefarious, ulterior motive. This even includes the reason that he joined the Zanzi Circus in the first place. It becomes quickly clear that Alonzo will stop at nothing to have Nanon all to himself. But because the character has no arms, he can't very well resort to physical bullying. Instead, Chaney paints a subversive and deviously manipulative character. Even the character's love for Nanon feels wicked--it's more of an unhealthy obsession than love.Browning makes good use of his largely pared down sets and cast. Except for the opening circus scene, most of the film takes place among only four characters, in only a handful of circus wagon (used later for both Freaks and Chaney's 1928 film Laugh, Clown, Laugh) and apartment locations, with the ending, set in a theater, symmetrically reflecting the opening of the film. A single scene in a formal courtyard provides a nice, symbolic contrast, as does the use of the \"extended technique\" of a thin piece of gauze placed over the camera lens for some of Nanon's scenes.Equally economical is Browning's complex story, which tells as much--with the aid of the performances--through implication of various backstories as it does through direct action. The (heavily allegorical) subtexts are fascinating. Nanon is frigid, so her most intimate relationship is with a man who has been effectively castrated. He is so obsessed with her that he'll physically sacrifice himself to enable a relationship. She secretly desires a normal love, but can't have one until she falls into it, or is tricked into it in a way. No one is quite honest with anyone else except for a man who is a relative simpleton, there to be manipulated. But he's the one who ends up coming out ahead, even though he never quite knows what is going on.Browning had to construct a number of elaborate set-ups to produce the illusion that Chaney had been using his feet to do everyday activities for a long time. We often see Chaney's body but Peter Dismuki's feet, such as when Alonzo is playing guitar, smoking, drinking, and so on. Occasionally, Dismuki just stood in for Chaney, usually when Alonzo has his back to the camera, but at least in one wider shot, we can see Dismuki's face.The 1997 score on the Turner Classic Movies version of the film by the Alloy Orchestra is occasionally excellent--especially during the climax of the film, and occasionally a bit pedestrian. When it's only pedestrian it's at least unobtrusive. The score has a modern, occasionally \"rocky\" feel that meshes surprisingly well.There are a few scenes missing from the print transferred to the TCM DVD, but for many years, The Unknown was thought to have been lost, similar to Browning and Chaney's 1927 film London After Midnight. A print was found at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, mixed in with a lot of other films marked \"unknown\" because the contents were (at least temporally) unidentifiable. The missing scenes do not hurt the coherency of the film, which is a must-see at least for any Chaney or Browning fans.", "\"The Unknown\" returns to a theme common in many of Lon Chaney's films, that of a man hopelessly in love with a woman he can never have.Alonzo, the armless man is performing in a gypsy circus as a sharpshooter/knife thrower working with the lovely Nanon (Joan Crawford) as his assistant. He is of course in love with her. Rounding out the triangle is circus strong man Malabar (Norman Kerry) who is also in love with Nanon. Nanon it seems cannot bear to have a man's hands touch her (Joan Crawford?).Alonzo is not what he seems to be. It turns out that he is a fugitive on the run and it is revealed that he actually does have arms and has created the armless man to hide a deformity that would identify him as the criminal the police are seeking. And given that Nanon cannot stand for a man to touch her, she repels Malabar's advances and places her trust in Alonzo.Nanon's father, Zanzi (Nick DeRuiz) wants his daughter to stay away from Alonzo and confronts him on the issue one night. Zanzi discovers Alonzo's secret so Alonzo murders him. Alonzo then re-confirms his intention to marry Nanon. Alonzo's trusted friend Cojo (John George) points out to Alonzo that should he marry Nanon, she would surely discover that he has arms on their wedding night. So, Alonzo sure that Nanon will marry him, arranges to have his arms amputated.When Alonzo returns from his ordeal he discovers that Nanon has gotten over her fear of men's hands and now plans to marry Malabar. Alonzo devastated, plots his revenge.Chaney plays an unsympathetic character in this film, so much so that he doesn't evoke the usual audience pity that he had in other films. His scenes as the armless man are outstanding and the things he does with his feet are truly amazing. And he could express so much emotion with just his facial expressions. Crawford was just getting her career into going and went on to a lengthy career spanning over 40 years. Kerry had also appeared with Chaney in both \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1923) and \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925). The running time of the film varies depending on your sources. The version I saw runs about 50 minutes. The Citadel Book, \"The Films of Joan Crawford\" lists it at 65 minutes. IMDb lists running times of 61 and 49 minutes respectively. Despite the short running time it nevertheless presents a complete and riveting story. I would like to know what was cut out though.", "The Unknown (1927)We can see The Unknown today and say, wow, look at the young Joan Crawford. And she does help make this movie come alive, more than even Lon Chaney, who was the big draw for audiences in 1927. Crawford's spark (inspired by Chaney, by her own account), and her character's phobia of men's hands (which she explains quite reasonably, having been groped too many times against her will) make her curious and very sympathetic. She's terrific to watch, and the metaphor of abuse against women is not lost on anyone paying attention.But Crawford was essentially unknown back then, and the movie depended on the name, and the high dramatics, of Chaney and the other lead male, the charming, somewhat overly chipper strong man in this huge sideshow of a movie. Both are good enough in their roles, Chaney pulling out all the stops in a performance that might be bravura or might just be virtuosic indulgence, probably a bit of both.And the movie depends on the story itself, the plot, the strange and gruesome series of events, which are gripping at times even if you know what's coming all too well. For viewers then as much as now, there is also the whole milieu, director Tod Browning's leaning to the macabre and the small time circus. This will see a more amazing fruition five years alter in Freaks, shortly after his very successful Dracula (with its self-sustaining sideshow of bizarre, legendary types). But here we have Browning at the end of the silent era, pushing gestures and expressions outward in the place of sound. It's a bit strained, and with the sensational plot, the whole movie lacks subtlety and depth.What it doesn't lack is high drama, though, and a few surprises. At times touching, at times simply shocking (in its own way), it's enjoyable, and never really flags, which some \"better\" silent films like Broken Blossoms can't claim. So forget beauty, or elegance or emotional insight and you might really like this.Oh, and Chaney? He is a marvel of his time, and this film shows him in one of his best roles as an actor, one of many. The armless man is yet another echo of the horrors of mutilated soldiers coming home from World War I and their inability to really assimilate and be accepted. The fact that his character is obsessed with Crawford's we might understand, but it's a love that we don't sympathize with after awhile.", "Tod Browning is one of the great mysteries of film history. His life story is filled with contradictions (some he created himself). No one argues the fact that he was the architect of the classic American horror film Dracula (1931), with Bela Lugosi as Dracula. His success is one that is grounded in his macabre but decidedly non-supernatural silent works. Beyond that the story gets cloudy. The \"official\" line is that he went on to make Freaks (1932) and the results were so horrific that it virtually destroyed his career, making the studio keep a tight rein on his subsequent genre efforts.At the top of the list for strangeness is The Unknown (1927), one of the great silent films of all time. It was also one of the most offbeat psychological dramas ever produced by a major studio, especially one such as MGM. The collaboration between director/writer Tod Browning, himself a one time circus performer, and the intense performance by Lon Chaney, was a thing of magic.The focus of the story is Alonzo (Lon Chaney) is an armless knife-thrower in a gypsy circus, known as \"Alonzo, The Armless Wonder.\" He's really not armless, but has his arms strapped to his sides to appear limbless since he wishes to hide his identity from the cops. He's a career criminal on the run who with his cohort Cojo (John George), and continues to commit robberies while touring with the circus. Cojo is the only one who knows his secret and is the only friend he has. Alonzo is able to fling the knives with the toes of his feet, and his assistant Nano (Joan Crawford) is the target. She's the beautiful daughter of the circus owner and ringmaster, Zanzi (Nick de Ruiz).Alonzo has become obsessed with Nano, and would do anything in the world for her love. He would also, he tells Cojo, do anything he could to someone who takes her away from him. Nano has a bit of a psychological problem, she can't stand any man who puts their arms around her or who tries to touch her. She feels very safe with Alonzo and they develop an affectionate bond of friendship, where she feels good hugging him. The circus strongman Malabar (Kerry) also compulsively loves her and won't take no for an answer, but he keeps putting his arms around her as she pushes him away.Zanzi doesn't trust Alonzo and when he sees his daughter alone with him again, his anger builds because he feels he is putting \"ideas\" in his daughter's head. In a fit of rage he beats Alonzo with a whip until Malabar puts a stop to it and receives the thanks of Alonzo. But one evening Zanzi again confronts Alonzo, this time in the dark shadows nearby Nano's wagon and he notices that Alonzo has arms. This causes Alonzo to strangle him to death, but Nano could only see that the strangler had two thumbs on one hand.Realizing that he can't marry her if he has arms, Alonzo decides to have them cut off. Alonzo blackmails a doctor (Lanning) into doing the procedure. But when he returns to see Nano, she tells him that she overcame her fear of having a man put her arms around her and will marry Malabar. The scene in this film when he realizes that he's cut off his arms for nothing is one of the most emotional in all of silent film (perhaps all of film), and it consists mostly of a closeup of his face as the horrible irony registers. Chaney's performance, and maybe our instinctive support of the underdog, has the odd effect of making you hope that he wins in the end, even though he's a murderer and he plots to have Malabar's arms ripped from his body by horses.We get a glimpse of the pain that Chaney must have felt with his arms strapped to his chest day after day on the set. Mirroring that is a scene when he distractedly lights a cigarette with his feet, an intricate process that was aided by Peter Dismuki, a real armless man who served as a stunt double for many of Chaney's actions. Cojo (John George), Alonzo's dwarf assistant, looks on with growing mirth until he bursts out, reminding Alonzo that his arms aren't bound.In the late silent period, filmmakers were advancing their art at an astonishing pace. Over at Fox, F.W. Murnau was making the most elegant of all silent films, Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans, which seemingly liberated the camera from gravity and demonstrated breathtaking in-camera optical effects. Browning and cinematographer Merritt B. Gerstad were not so precocious, but their experiments with filters and camera placement are nearly as intriguing. In a beautifully composed scene, Nanon grieves over her father's death and struggles between her love for the strongman Malabar and her fear of his hands; Malabar enters the room and confesses his undying love for her and his willingness to wait until her fear subsides. The shots are filmed through a heavy gauze that gives the entire composition the look of an oil painting with visible brushwork; it adds a softness and an intimacy that's similar to the effect later directors desired when they used soft-focus closeups of smiling women's faces, but there's nothing silly about its use here.With that being said, Lon Chaney always played wild, scary and intriguing roles that garnered our pity and our sympathies no matter how horrifying they were. Part of the reason is because Chaney could play the agony of unrequited love like nobody else. His ability to lose the girl, when the movie hero would usually win her, was remarkably heartbreaking. This is just one reason why Chaney made an indelible impression on the history of cinema. The other was that he had a creepy presence on screen \u0096 even when he played the good guy.", "A very weird film much in the style of Tod Browning, THE UNKNOWN, while not being a horror film, has nevertheless been considered one of Lon Chaney's more distinctive work. The story is just too eccentric: Alonzo the Armless, played by Chaney, is a carnival performer who uses his feet for his stunts and has come to believe that Nanon Zanzi, played by Joan Crawford, who hates being touched by men, may eventually fall for him. While concealing his own arms, he propels her to Malabar the Strongman, but Malabar's gentle nature wins Nanon over. Alonzo resorts to extreme measures to make sure he can win Nanon back, but in true Browning fashion, he meets a particularly gruesome ending.Right at the end of the silent film era, THE UNKNOWN came around with its typical Twenties' setups and wild overacting, and it benefits from its time; if it had been made only a year or two later, it would have been unbelievable. There is a very dream-like quality to this film, even in scenes with Norman Kerry and Joan Crawford just walking under the sunshine. Tod Browning loved the strange, and with the exception of FREAKS, this is a very strange movie. Chaney is -- surprise -- chilling even without makeup and holding his arms together under his clothes. All anyone has to do is to watch his expression when he has come back, sans arms, and Nanon tells him she is in love with Malabar.It's not surprising that films that initially repel are later re-discovered and even praised. THE UNKNOWN is no exception to the rule. The thought that a man would go to chopping off his arms to make a woman love him is just disturbing. That the MacGuffin in the movie is her fear of being touched makes his ultimate choice even more disturbing. Chaney gives his usual tour-de-force performance, Crawford shows the girl she still was, and the last sequence, involving an attempt by Chaney to murder Malabar in which two horses, rigged for a performance, run out of control as Crawford, is short, bloodless, but spellbinding.", "\"The Unknown\" has to have one of the strangest plots of any movie I've seen, but I can't describe it without spoiling it. Suffice to say; coming from the mind of Tod Browning who set the story in a traveling carnival, you know it's going to be delving into some heavy weirdness.\"The Unknown\" is a silent film starring Lon Chaney, Sr., as carnival star Alonzo the Armless, an expert with gun and knife, who, because of his condition, must use his feet instead of hands. His assistant and unrequited love interest is Nanon, played by a very young and beautiful Joan Crawford. There's a love triangle between these two and the carnival strong man, and oh, what Alonzo won't do to win his ladylove.My only regret is that I saw the 49-minute version taped off of Turner Classic Movies, and the movie does go by quickly. Short as it is though, it's a weird and entertaining trip.", "The Unknown is a fabulous film; I didn't like the comments on the main page for this film so I thought I'd write some about this film itself, instead of a biography of Lon and Browning. The Unknown is fresh and horrifying almost 80 years later -- the only audiences who'll be thrown will the the ones who have gotten so used to \"realistic\" cinema that they don't appreciate a story whose very reason for being contains nothing conclusive. This is only a surface melodrama, for, like Lon's other great triumphs in film, this film presents a story in which the pains and tribulations of Lon's character are only too predictable.... broken by moments of complete shock. It is a story of desperation and a man who believes he is righteous in his vengeance. The scene where Lon's eyes well up with tears of joy in anticipation of seeing Joan Crawford's boyfriend torn to pieces is priceless. As usual, Lon appeals to our best sadistic instincts while also eliciting genuine sympathy for his impossible love. This movie is a dark fairy tale that it is impossible to resist unless you have grown too old in heart to appreciate the dark pools that contain true human magic.edited to add spoilers warning", "Lon Chaney (as Alonzo the Armless) is a criminal posing as an armless circus knife-wielder; he amazes by throwing knives with his feet, notably at assistant Joan Crawford (as Nanon Zanzi). Actually, Mr. Chaney's arms are tightly girdled to his chest; he suffers from an obvious deformity, which would identify him to authorities - he has two thumbs on his left hand. Evidently a victim of sex abuse, Ms. Crawford has an unusual fear of arms; so, she rejects the advances of circus strongman Norman Kerry (as Malabar the Mighty). Instead, she warms up to the armless Chaney. He mistakes Crawford's affection for love, and decides to make himself her ideal, by amputating his arms! While Chaney recuperates, Crawford overcomes her fear, and begins to enjoy Mr. Kerry's muscular arms. When he returns, Chaney is understandably upsetChaney and director Tod Browning are superb in this disturbing, horrific drama. Browning builds great suspense in the wonderful ending, wherein he winds up disturbing images in your mind, and teasingly leaves them on the verge of exploding - as usual, the horror unseen is the most unsettling. Crawford excels in one of her best early roles; she plays falling in love with Kerry exceptionally well. Of course, no one can match Chaney; though great throughout, his scene realizing Crawford never truly loved him is emotionally wrenching. Great character actor John George (as Cojo) has a fine role as Chaney's helper - the scene where he first unwraps the girdled \"Alonzo\" should have your eyes glued to the screen. There appear to be some portions of \"The Unknown\" missing, but the amputation of footage hasn't spoiled the film.********* The Unknown (6/4/27) Tod Browning ~ Lon Chaney, Joan Crawford, Norman Kerry, John George", "One of the strong points of silent movies is that they are naive in the positive meaning of the word: they are creative.If anyone does a story like that today, one has to choose to do a drama, a thriller or a black comedy. Browning did not have to choose... he just made a very strange film.Another plus is the use of running time. No fillers. Just 60 minutes of strange ideas. The film is not perfect; and not anyone will enjoy it. But it features a great performance by Lon Chaney and nice photography (incl. creative use of backprojection). And if you like FREAKS, you have to see this one... the background of Browning as a circus assistant really shows up (though I hope, it wasn't that bad).Sorry, no story details. I don't want to ruin your fun.", "This is a truly spellbinding movie, one of the more bizarre you are likely to see. With Lon Chaney hiding from the law pretending to be an armless circus performer. Joan Crawford is stunningly beautiful as Nanon, the girl he loves. A well done serpentine story that tells more in under an hour than most films made today can tell in  two hours. Chaney is the best film actor of all time, he really was the man of a thousand faces. It is a shame that some Browning/Chaney films have been lost forever, but this is one that should be watched by all, it is fantastic.", "I give this one 8/10 simply for uniqueness. It's not a horror film, but if you can follow and swallow it The Unknown certainly is an unsettling experience. I don't think anyone has spoiled it yet for the unwary so for an explanation of why, the best thing to do is watch it! Suffice to report it's a tale of twisted love and the lengths a man's passion goes to ... to get his hands on the woman. Alonzo didn't understand women however!Tod Browning sailed close to the edge as usual, and Lon Chaney put in a fine performance as a murderer on the run - I presume he was, from extrapolation of events in the 47 minute TCM UK TV version. Joan Crawford looked very pretty, before Hollywood really got hold of her and uglified her.There's obviously many bits missing from this print, but by paying attention it's fairly straightforward to understand. I think it's worth it too, especially if you like silent films as I do. The scenes photographed through gauze were striking, but what was that all about?! Overall, different and slightly depressing - is the moral we men are all so desperate when infatuated with a woman?", "Lon Chaney plays Alonzo, a supposedly armless knife thrower with a gypsy circus. He DOES have arms though (one with two thumbs)--he just straps them to himself. He then uses his arms to rob jewels at the towns they play in. He loves Nanon (Joan Crawford). But he strangles her ridiculously cruel father to death one night. She doesn't see his face but notices one of the hands has two thumbs...He has his arms amputated...but she falls for circus strongman Maldabar (Norman Kerry).Not really a horror film (as it's often called)...more of a tragedy. The plot is OK (and not as convoluted as my synopsis makes it sound :)) and the direction is solid but uninspired (Tod Browning has always been overrated). It's worth seeing for Chaney and Crawfords acting. Crawford is incredible--so young, beautiful and full of life. Chaney is just incredible--the expression on his face when he tries to hide his anger and sadness at Kerry is truly extraordinary. He does carry on the sneering a little too much (I started giggling at it towards the end) but that's a minor complaint.The only version I've seen is on TCM and it IS short (less than an hour), but it's the exact same one I saw back in the late 1980s when revival theatres were showing it. And it SEEMS complete to me--there are no gaps in story or continuity.So, well worth catching. One of Chaney's best.", "Lon Chaney plays a man in hiding. He was a knife thrower but once in a fit of rage killed someone. So now, he pretends to be armless and is a freak in a circus. Well, he actually has arms but keeps them tightly bound around him and no one suspects the ruse--not even Joan Crawford--who he soon falls for head-over-heels. And, to her, this is an ideal situation because she is afraid to be touched and likes the idea of an armless guy. Well, to capture her heart for good, Chaney decides to REALLY have his arms sawn off. Well, the plan goes awry when he finds that Crawford has suddenly cured herself of this weird phobia--talk about lousy timing!While if you notice, this plot is VERY peculiar and a bit unbelievable to say the least. However, because it's executed so well, you find yourself being sucked in and the horror of the film is very gripping. In fact, it's one of the most terrifying and horrific films I have seen other than director Browning's FREAKS. Quite a film, as in addition to the great plot, Chaney does perhaps the best and most painful acting job of his career--making himself look absolutely like an armless man--it really was done perfectly. An amazing picture and one of the best of the silent age.", "Young Joan Crawford learned a lot from watching and talking to Lon Chaney on the set of this very strange horror film.Alonzo the Armless is a knife thrower with a traveling circus in Spain. His assistant is Nanon, who has a phobia about men with arms. Her fear is real - \"men's arms clutching, grabbing\". Malabar the Mighty is the circus strongman who loves Nanon - but he has arms. Alonzo also loves her. Without arms - she trusts him and tells him her deepest feelings.Alonzo has a secret - he does have arms but because he has two thumbs and is responsible for a spate of robberies that occur whenever the circus stops - he binds up his arms as the police will not suspect an armless man. Nanon's father is the ringmaster (who may be responsible for her irrational fears) and hates Alonzo. In a heated scuffle Alonzo chokes him. He has been strolling around with his arms unbound. Nanon sees someone strangling her father - a man with two thumbs but she doesn't see his face.With her father dead, the circus breaks up and Alonzo tries to make a home for Nanon. Malabar will not give up his love for her. When Alonzo threatens a doctor with exposure unless he amputates his arms, Nanon finally loses her fear and learns to love Malabar. Even though the film I saw was around an hour in length part of the storyline was missing to do with this doctor. He knew Alonzo and the audience was supposed to know why - there was also a cryptic note the knifethrower sent him as well.When Alonzo returns and finds his beloved almost married to Malabar, his insanity knows no bounds. Once again Lon Chaney's acting is superlative - his facial expressions are spellbinding - you really believe he is going mad!!!! He secretly hatches a plan. Malabar's new act involves a show of strength where he is strapped to galloping horses!!!! If the gears are going too fast his arms will be torn from his body.My first impression on viewing this film was that I didn't like it - then as I thought about it I realized it was a compelling if bizarre movie.Norman Kerry who was supposed to be the Errol Flynn of the 20s played Malabar. Lon Chaney and Joan Crawford are the stars to watch. I have already praised Chaney's acting but the skill with which he used cutlery, lighted and smoked cigarettes, to say nothing of throwing knives and shooting pistols - all with his feet is amazing!!! A young and beautiful Joan Crawford in one of her earlier film appearances played Nanon. She acted with assurance and polish.Highly recommended.", "I've heard so much about this movie, and it was not a disappointment. The surviving print seems to be missing some scenes, which accounts for its short length, but I doubt it takes away much from this twisted, sadistic \"Gift of the Magi\" gone bad. Chaney's performance is remarkable and, at times, genuinely alarming, and the very young Joan Crawford is a typical, but nevertheless appealing silent film heroine. Parts of this film really had me squirming, particularly towards the end. Browning's visual sense is the most beautiful I've seen in any of his films other than Dracula, with a full range of greys, whites and blacks and painterly compositions. It's available on TCM's excellent Lon Chaney Collection DVD.", "Let's give Tod Browning a hand. He risked life and limb to make this movie.Anyway, I never thought I'd like a silent movie but this is one you can't turn away from. The performances are amazing, Lon Chaney is so good that you can read his mind, you almost don't need the words. And let me just say this about Joan Crawford: she never looked better than she does in this movie. Lithe, svelte, and statuesque, she glides through the movie like a ballet dancer, and her body is as taut as a leopard's. It's difficult to describe her youthful attraction without bringing to mind the caricature she became later in life with her shoulder pads and thick eyebrows, but in this movie she is simply stunning. Her eyes are so intense that they don't look real.The story itself is very simple, sure people can describe it to you, but Chaney's Alonzo is so carefully fleshed out that he practically pops off the screen, you have to see it to believe it. He seethes with anger when the hunky Malabar makes a pass at Nanon. Nanon's pathological aversion to being touched by men is matched only by Alonzo's pathological obsession with Nanon. This is where the power of the movie lies. When the fickle Nanon's man-hands-phobia evaporates after spending several weeks with the anxious and ever-patient Malabar, she announces their engagement to Alonzo and his psychotic behavior explodes. You can read the mixture of irony, rage, and madness that simultaneously wash over Chaney's face. Browning lets this powerful scene go on for several minutes, and every moment is wrenching. As Alonzo teeters on the edge of madness, lamenting his dearly departed arms, Malabar and Nanon join in his laughter, thinking he is happy for them. It's a horrible thing to see, it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion.If you only watch one silent film in your life, let this be the one. It's really weird and cool.", "This silent classic from the embryonic stages of the horror genre was filmed by Tod Browning about four years before directing Bela Lugosi in the first sound version of 'Dracula' (1931). By this stage he had already shot a large number of two reelers since starting his directorial career in 1915. Browning's background was as a carnival barker, clown and and black-faced minstrel before joining DW Griffith in 1913 and, as with this film, a number of his films utilise carnival characters and the circus milieu, from 'The Show' (also 1927) to 'Freaks' (1932).Set in Spain, Lon Chaney Senior plays Alonzo, an 'armless' knife-thrower who is passionately in love with the circus owner's daughter, Nanon (played by a young Joan Crawford). Nanon has a pathalogical fear of being touched by men, so one would have thought she need look no further, were it not for the attentions of Malabar, the circus strongman (Norman Kerry). However, Alonzo is not as he seems; a mass murderer who hides his arms and his trademark bifurcated thumbs strapped beneath a corset. As his dwarven Lautrec-like sidekick Cojo (John George) points out, should they ever marry it would not be too long before Nanon discovers his secret. Alonzo therefore bribes a surgeon to remove his arms, only to discover that the object of his obsession has overcome her phobia and has found relief from her condition in the bulging arms of Malabar.The rather grotesque story of amour fou unfolds steadily and surely, with a neat sting in the tail at the end, but it is Chaney, the 'man of a thousand faces' that really makes the piece. Born in 1896 to deaf deaf-mute parents perfected his skills of mime by necessity, so was a natural for the silent screen where he became the first major star of the genre in films such as 'The Miracle Man' (1919), 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1923) and 'The Phantom of the Opera' (1925). Browning and he made a total of ten films together, starting with 'The Unholy Three' (1925) and including 'London After Midnight' (1927) and 'West of Zanzibar' (1928). What is most impressive here is the way in which he contorts his body, expressing the role through his posture. Scenes such as him smoking a cigarette with his feet while his arms lie draped over the sides of his armchair, or twiddling his toes with an empty glass of wine in front of him when his beloved fails to turn up to an arranged rendez-vous are just mind-boggling.Unfortunately for Chaney, in the same year as this film came 'The Jazz Singer', the first ever talkie, and the following year, the all-talking horrors of 'The Terror' (Roy del Ruth). Chaney only ever made one sound film, a remake of 'The Unholy Three' in 1930, but was recovering from a throat cancer operation when it was shot and died shortly after. His son, Lon Chaney Jnr, took over his mantle to become one of Universal's early major horror stars, and later a prolific B-movie fixture in the likes of 'The Alligator People' (1951) and 'Al Adamson's 'Dracula Vs. Frankenstein' (1971).", "As Leonard Maltin remarks, \"ultra creepy\" even by Tod Browning's standards. It's the story of a seemingly armless circus man on the lam from the law who hides out in a gypsy wagon. LON CHANEY, of course, plays the man who's in love with showgirl Nanon, JOAN CRAWFORD. The bizarre story is based somewhat on Browning's own circus background as a youth.Chaney is Alonzo the not so Armless man who throws knives at gypsy girl Crawford with his feet. Alonzo loves the girl and vows to protect her from the grasping arms of other men. He's jealous of the attention paid to her by NORMAN KERRY. When the armless man commits the murder of another gypsy, he's able to conceal his guilt by hiding behind his armless disguise.The plot takes a weird turn when Alonzo decides to have a doctor amputate his arms so Nanon will still love him when she discovers him to be truly armless on their wedding night. A doctor is bribed to perform the operation and Alonzo returns to the gypsy camp weeks later. What he doesn't realize is that Nanon has fallen in love with the strong man he was jealous of and is planning to marry him.Without spoiling the rest of the plot, that's as far as I'll go with the outline--but as you can see it's quite an unusual story and it gets the full treatment from Lon Chaney. He's marvelous in the scene where he realizes his great sacrifice has been for nothing.Well worth viewing.", "This Lon Chaney classic is a real gem, as Chaney and director Tod Browning create a movie that is at once fascinating, unusual, unsettling, and many other things. The story is loaded with bizarre elements and suggestive themes, not to mention some moments of almost painful suspense. Chaney's characterization is masterful, even by his high standards, and Browning's sure hand pulls the unusual material together very well.Alonzo the Armless, Chaney's character, is the kind of sinister, twisted, quirky villain that so many film-makers and actors try to create, but that so few can do with any significant trace of believability. Chaney was a master not only of disguise and costumes, but of mannerisms and facial expressions, communicating more with a momentary look on his face than most actors can convey with pages full of dialogue. Browning chooses to tell the viewers almost nothing factual about Alonzo's past, yet you never need to know, since everything important is there in Chaney's portrayal of him. As weird as the character is, he is fully three-dimensional right from the start, with plenty of secrets and plenty of substance.The story is just as weird and troubling as the main character. The atmospheric setting in the circus provides a suitable background for an unusual love triangle. Norman Kerry is well-cast as the eager but dull-witted strongman, and a very young-looking Joan Crawford gives an interesting touch to Chaney's troubled partner in his knife-throwing act. The actual act is only seen briefly, but its weirdness also helps in setting up the overall situation.This certainly isn't for everybody, but for those who don't mind a good dose of the bizarre, it is one of silent cinema's best and strangest horror movies. Chaney gives one of his most memorable performances, and the story is hard to forget as well.", "By this point, you should be familiar with the fact that Lon Chaney was a master at playing all kinds of malformed and ghastly characters, even if you haven't watched his movies. This film has a number of correlations with another classic Chaney movie made several years before: The Penalty. In it, Chaney wants to take revenge on the father of a girl he likes because he unnecessarily amputated both his legs as a child. The reason I say it shares a lot in common with The Unknown is because they both involve Chaney not having limbs as well as having a love interest. The movie is about Chaney playing a character known as Alonzo the Armless. True to his name, he is a circus performer that has no arms whatsoever (or so it seems), and throws knives with his feet instead. His partner in the circus is a girl named Nanon (Joan Crawford). A little known fact about Alonzo is that he's also a criminal, but only one other performer knows this. Alonzo is stuck in a love triangle that involves Nanon and another performer named Malabar. Due to his immense strength, Nanon feels uneasy around him and only wants to be with Alonzo, because as far as she knows, he is armless. Later, Alonzo's cover is blown by Nanon's father (who owns the circus), and Alonzo has no choice but to kill him to prevent the word from getting out. Unfortunately, Nanon partially witnesses the killing, but because she doesn't know Alonzo has arms, she doesn't think he did it. After a while, Alonzo actually goes to a surgeon and gets his arms removed for real, thinking it will make Nanon like him more. Once he returns to Nanon however, he is shocked to find out she is no longer scared of Malabar and they now like each other. Alonzo goes into a rage and is killed when a horse steps on him after he tries to interfere in Malabar's new act (which has two horses pull each of his arms in opposite directions). This is one of the strangest and shortest movies I've ever seen. What other movie can you say \"I just saw an armless Lon Chaney get stepped on by a horse?\" There's not many out there. As expected, Chaney plays his character well, and the audience can easily feel his frustration when he amputates his arms for this girl and it doesn't change a thing. It's also a strange feeling to see Joan Crawford at just 18 years old, and I'm pretty certain this is the only movie she and Lon did together. Even though it was a brief experience, Crawford credited Chaney with showing her the difference between standing in front of a camera and acting in front of one. Tod Browning was known for making a lot of weird and often macabre movies (Freaks would come out a few years later), and this one is no exception. In any case, it is a good combination of horror and infatuation.", "Tod Browning is much better known for his \"Dracula\" (1931) and, to a lesser extent, the cult classic \"Freaks\" (1932) than for this oddity from the limelight of the Silent Era.  From the opening scenes, in which an armless man (Chaney, natch) undresses a young Joan Crawford during a circus act by pitching daggers with his feet, this is a characteristically dark, warped picture from Browning that draws a great deal of power from Chaney doing what he does best: playing a tormented freak secretly endeavoring to gain the heart of a beautiful woman.\"The Unknown\" isn't perfect, but it most certainly is memorable, distinguishing itself as one of the weirdest films of all time.", "(potential spoilers) The music accompaniment to this silent gem (at least, the version I heard on TCM) underscored the problems that envelop the self-described Gypsy Circus, and was well synchronized to the action.  I have to wonder if the movie would have had the same impact without it.  Nevertheless, the visuals were disturbing enough.It is wonderful to see Lon Chaney Sr. near the end of his career, and Joan Crawford at the beginning of hers.  But the real star is author Tod Browning for his ironic plot twists and especially his advanced psychological insights, considering that this film was produced in 1927.Some of these are somewhat overstated, but that can be excused on the grounds that this is a silent film.  The fact remains that the psychodynamics ring true today for syndromes that did not even have names in the 1920's.  The film deals well with an early Joan Crawford's phobic post traumatic stress.  Lon Chaney shines.  His character develops into what turns out to be a truly evil predator, in the form of a psychopathic stalker.  Nevermind that he claims to want to marry her.  She has given him no encouragement,  He has built up a doomed-to-fail fantasy about her, and it is stalking, pure and simple.  And yet -- as so often with real life sociopaths -- we unaccountably have a degree of empathy for him that he never feels toward others.I found it a bit disconcerting that Mr. Chaney -- supposedly armless -- too obviously had real arms trussed up under his shirt... until it was revealed that his CHARACTER had real arms trussed up under his shirt!  The reasons for this bespeak an unsavory past.  And there need be no lingering questions about the future -- for even if things in the present unfold the way he wants them to, he would yet continue a path of destruction.  Just when you think that this person can sink no lower...he does.What is more, Miss Crawford's character is not even aware that she is being stalked -- she who is so fearful of the touch of men.  In one disturbing scene in particular, the lovely young lady joins in his laughter, innocently never realizing WHY he is laughing.  Aside from the audience, few really find out the truth about the man, usually to their demise.The suspense would give even the great Hitchcock a run for his money.  I found myself cringing and gripping my chair, especially in the final moments.  9 out of 10.", "\"The Unknown\", showing as second in the Barbican's Lon Chaney series, was a more or less unqualified success; from my point of view, at any rate! The audience seemed down slightly on attendance for the \"Phantom\", but on one of the hottest weekends of the year that was no surprise -- the climb down to cool and dim 'Level -2' in the bowels of the building came as a welcome change.I was somewhat nervous about the billed electronic accompaniment from the mixing desk of \"DJ Nacho Martin\", but in fact it worked out very well. I don't think I'd choose to listen to that sort of thing for pleasure, but for this disturbing film the insistent looped samples and 'Spanish' snippets serve to accentuate the off-beat nature of the story; and after all, one probably wouldn't choose to sit and listen to an improvised piano accompaniment as a piece on its own. In any case, the synthesizer effects were generally an emphasis to the visuals rather than a distraction.\"The Unknown\" is definitely a very different kettle of fish from \"The Phantom of the Opera\", and I would say undoubtedly a better picture. More unified and coherent, anyhow -- although at only 49 minutes there isn't exactly a lot of scope for longeurs! (I gather there's an American print in existence that runs about ten minutes longer...) Powerful stuff. I was particularly struck by the way that the backstory is virtually all implied; we don't know who Alonzo is, we don't know how he gained his skill, we don't know how he came to the circus or the past significance of his (real) deformity, let alone the nature of his hold over the surgeon -- and yet we don't need to; we know, or come to know, what sort of a man he is, and that is enough. And yet Lon Chaney makes him a sympathetic character: as he takes the title roles in both \"Phantom\" and \"Hunchback\", I take it this is his special gift, to make monstrosities human.Considered as a purely technical achievement, it occurs to me that this is one silent film at least where a simple list of the titles would leave out vital parts of the plot, which are conveyed entirely unspoken. I love the scene where the dwarf is sent off to be finger-printed, and Alonzo enquires mockingly if he is to have his toe-prints taken ;-)One bit I don't understand is the effect by which numerous scenes have the appearance of being photographed on linen or on heavily textured brown-paper; at least, I don't understand either how it's done, or why. On the first occurrence (looking through into Nanon's apartment) I assumed that the view was intended to be peering through a net curtain, but it happens again in circumstances where this obviously isn't the case.The part of the film that didn't work for me was the abrupt happy ending, which is very banal, and seemed highly inappropriate attached to what is basically a tragedy in the true Greek sense. Again, I wondered if this disjointed leap was the result of what is presumably missing footage, given the odd length of the print?General cumulative verdict: I'm definitely impressed by Lon Chaney, and young Joan Crawford is certainly an eyeful -- and a good actress, too ;-)", "A criminal on the run (Lon Chaney) hides in a circus and seeks to possess the daughter (Joan Crawford) of the ringmaster at any cost.Love, crime, a hidden identity, and horses on treadmills all come together for this silent classic, now mostly forgotten. And it all blends together beautifully well, with Chaney taking the lead and everyone following in his path.Some of the best parts are the use of feet for smoking and knife-throwing. How much is Chaney and how much is his double is hard to say exactly. While it all looks like him, clever camera tricks may have fooled me. Either way, people who use their feet as hands are pretty cool.Reviews at the time were quite positive, as they should have been. Photoplay appreciated the \"macabre atmosphere\" and Harrison's Reports noted it was \"artistically acted and skillfully directed\". Variety was less praising, calling the movie \"not as great a picture as it might have been\", but what more did they want?This is definitely one of Chaney's strongest performances in his later years. That may be strange to say, but it is true. Although Chaney peaked in 1924-1925, his career was already over by 1930. This one is must-see."], "tt0018584": ["Most sources think The Wizard is a lost film. The Silent Era website lists its survival status as \"unknown\".

In spite of this, \"Cagliostro\" can still be enjoyed by silent film fans due to its powerful images and thrilling sequences.The most evident aspect of the film is its conventional film narrative, perfect for an epoch film production which balances doses of adventure with stylish film elements borrowed from other genres. An example of the latter can be found in the sequences wherein Cagliostro the magician demonstrates his powers and tricks in front of a shocked audience in shots full of the mystery and darkness of Expressionist shadows. In contrast is the French royal court where everything is luminous and at the same time decadent, a court full of hypocrites and opportunists with corruption and ambition everywhere. The set design provides a perfect background for all this and Herr Oswald's direction catches the mood of the times.Especially remarkable is the last part of the picture wherein Herr Cagliostro, who has to flee to Italy due his involvement in the Queen's Necklace affair, is imprisoned along with his wife Frau Lorenza. They are condemned to death and their devotion to each other is poignant and moving. It ends happily with their escape (a thrilling sequence and the beautiful cinematography of Herr Maurice Desfassiaux und Herr Jules Kruger is particularly striking in these moments).\"Cagliostro\" is an excellent depiction of a careerist and adventurer as well as being a social portrait of the decadence of the Royal French court, a dark film full of intrigues and action, a remarkable achievement whose virtues shine through splendidly even in this abridged form.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must warn Frau Marie-Antoinette not to lose her mind ( and her head ) over this Herr Graf.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com", "What we have here is half of what might have been a good movie about swashbuckling and courtly intrigue. Cagliostro is a late 1920s silent production made in German\u2013French co-production and considered lost until a copy turned up in the French film archives. Unfortunately, this is an edit of the two-hour original, and even with a few other fragments, it only comes at 58 minutes, losing multiple supporting characters and sub-plots, and leaving much of the plot development to title cards.And this is a shame, because the remaining footage gives us a fun story that's half historical drama (based on real events, no less) and half swashbuckling adventure. Cagliostro, an Italian adventurer played by the almost unnaturally handsome Hans St\u00fcwe, rises through the French aristocracy on account of his magical tricks, medical knowledge and ability to foretell the future. When he falls from favour after a divination that predicts a dire future for Marie Antoinette, he sets in motion a plan that will result in revenge, but at a great price.This is very much a movie that features beautiful people plotting against each other among sumptuous and grandiose interior sets. The tone is extremely amoral, and both Cagliostro and his opponents come across as tremendous scumbags. The film features some very explicit sexual content for its age, but alas, the swordplay featured on the original advertisements has almost all been cut. Likewise, the final act is over in pretty much 10 minutes; it may have been a larger segment in the original.And unfortunately, this is Cagliostro as we have it now: some good acting, interesting expressionist touches, hints of something that may have been a grand plot, lots of wigs, but not a full movie, and probably not something someone looking for a great film experience should buy until a more complete version turns up.", "Cagliostro gets revenge on the French court, then is imprisoned by the Inquisition in Rome.

The rest of what happens I cannot really say. Maybe because I'm still not totally sure myself. While I've yet to read the original Poe story, or see the later, more well known Roger Corman production with Vincent Price, I would probably advise on what little I know in comparing both films for the 1960 version if you're most concerned about sticking straight to the story.Apparently, by the way, Luis Bunuel, who was director Jean Epstein's chief collaborator, quit after creative clashes over this issue. For whatever reason it was, I'd be hard-pressed to figure on how much influence he did or didn't leave on the picture. As it stands, and probably sticking to a certain aesthetic that was familiar for those in love with Poe, the silent version of Fall of the House of Usher is chock full of atmosphere in every kind of delicious, creepy, wonderful kind of connotation. The production design is sometimes full of a smoke, or a smoke-filled tint from the camera, and the outside of the mansion is covered in dirty fields and dead trees. The inside of the house, the interiors of the walls, the mirrors, the paints of Roderick's, and the placement of the camera in some strange angles (i.e. guitar) all build up to something unexpected.Would I call it surrealism just because of Bunuel's involvement? Yes and no. Yes in that, of course, there are some striking moments that could only come out of a dream &/or a desire to just completely tool around with the audience's head just for the hell of it. And no because it's really Epstein's movie through it all, and he crafts this mostly as a somber, quietly intense picture where he experiments not in as a surrealist but as a director of contemplative Gothic horror. I can't even totally understand what absorbed me, but everything in the 'plastic', technical sense of the word did, not to mention the performances by Debucourt, Lamy, and especially Gance who all seem to be drifting in and out of the fantastical consciousness that seems to be living in this place, where life and death merge or go un-hinged, and (as another reviewer noted) is like a slow-poisoning prison.Just, as I said, don't watch it to be wrapped up in 'what happens next in the \"plot\"', as it's more about what may happen in the next twist with a setting or a mood, or if a character should suddenly have a look that changes everything. It's not the greatest of the near-end silent period, but it's close.", "I had always wanted to check out this Silent version of the Edgar Allan Poe horror perennial, and not just because of Luis Bunuel's involvement; actually, he only served as Second Assistant in charge of interiors on the film \u2013 so much for the co-directing credit that is often attributed to him (including the DVD front cover). Ironically, when the disc was released by All Day Entertainment, I recall complaining about its \"Collector's Edition\" moniker when it was a bare-bones affair apart from an essay by the director himself \u2013 the company's President David Kalat, however, was prompt to inform me that the proposed Bunuel-related supplements fell through at the last minute.Anyway, this is now my third viewing of the movie: the second had occurred either as part of an earlier Bunuel retrospective or to compare it with one of the many other filmic renditions of the tale. For the record, a viewing of the obscure low-budgeted 1949 British effort followed this re-acquaintance with the Epstein film, while I also own and have watched the U.S. short (also from 1928) and the 1960 Roger Corman/Vincent Price classic\u0085but there are at least five more versions I would be interested in catching (by such notable directors as Alexandre Astruc, Jan Svankmajer, Jesus Franco, Curtis Harrington and Ken Russell)!That said, my reaction to the film under review continues to be ambivalent: to begin with, this is perhaps one of only two cases which can truly be described as a dream-like experience (the other being the equally haunting but more readily satisfying VAMPYR [1932] by one of my favorite auteurs, Carl Theodor Dreyer); however, the sluggish pacing makes its brief 66 minutes feel long\u0085not helped by the archaic parts of the accompanying score (at least, some of it was suitably avant-gardist) and the droning narration, reading the English translation of the original French intertitles, by respected but heavily-accented actor Jean-Pierre Aumont!Visually, the film really cannot be faulted as the Impressionist first half (with images that could almost be taken for paintings) giving way unsurprisingly to Expressionism in the much-anticipated high-strung finale. Even more than in MAUPRAT (1926), Epstein virtually lets the camera and the editing tell the story: the acting actually leaves much to be desired (especially since both Usher and his guest are way overage, with the latter bafflingly also made out to be quite deaf!); as for Madeleine, she is played by Marguerite Gance (wife of famous pioneer film-maker Abel \u2013 Bunuel's disdain of whom eventually cost him his job!), who manages the character's essential frailty and subsequent wraith-like features. Incidentally, Roderick and Madeleine are here husband and wife rather than brother and sister; other unwarranted changes to the source material were its depiction of the Usher mansion as something of a monstrous abode, akin to Castle Dracula, and the rather disappointing climax in which the Ushers actually survive the ordeal \u2013 thus rendering the title pointless!Again, the power (and reputation) of the film rests squarely on its memorable detail: taking a cue from Poe's \"The Oval Portrait\", Madeleine's 'painting' by Roderick literally comes to life as its subject fades away more and more (at one point, Madeleine even feels her husband's brush stroke on the canvas, as if it had really touched her cheek); her eventual succumbing to catalepsy, played out in slow-motion; the lengthy ritual of her burial (her resting-place even lying across the river, a la Bunuel's own much-later THE RIVER AND DEATH [1955]); her 'resurrection' (amusingly, the name Ligeia also crops up as an ancestor in the Usher family crypt!), with the sight of the casket moving about in the grave anticipating the surreal coffin-scurrying-through-the-wilderness sequence from the Spanish maestro's SIMON OF THE DESERT (1965), etc.Despite the rather grainy DVD transfer (the faults of the print exposed all the more on my 40\" TV monitor), the quality of the cinematography comes though \u2013 highlighting both the desolate, fog-bound landscape and the expansive interiors (the wind blowing through the house results in constantly billowing curtains and books falling from the library shelves in slow-motion); as already mentioned, Epstein practically runs the gamut of the cinematic language along the way, adopting such techniques as cross-cutting (at various points during one particular sequence incorporating, for no very good reason, a couple of frogs engaged in the act of copulation!) and superimposition, down to shaking the camera in order to evoke a character's disorientation. Unfortunately, the all-important closing moments of the film are rushed and decidedly muddled \u2013 even diminishing a nice effect ostensibly created by a constellation of stars, which appears in the skies behind the mansion, shaped like the Ushers' warped family-tree!While highly acclaimed in some quarters - with hyberbolic claims ranging from \"the finest horror film ever made\" to \"the pinnacle of artistic achievement in European cinema of the 1920s\" - this version would be all but forgotten forty years later (it does not even earn a mention in Carlos Clarens' influential tome \"An Illustrated History Of The Horror Film\") and the exact same destiny befell Epstein himself later on, despite having been one of the three key avant-garde French exponents of the era (the others were the afore-mentioned Abel Gance and Marcel L'Herbier).", "Predictably morbid and grim, this early cinematic tribute to Poe offers some interesting images and beautifully haunting music. I liked the sequence showing the lace-draped coffin, as it was carried out of that cavernous room.More stylistic than substantive, the overall effect of the film is to engender a sense of suffocating gloom, rather than to tell an interesting story. It's very much like what one would expect in a nightmare. Space seems strung-out. People are not quite real. Pacing is so slow as to render time suspended between two swings of the clock pendulum.I don't recall a film that conveyed such an overwhelming sense of introverted bleakness, oppression, and ubiquitous death. Even the trees were dead.A lot of viewers will find this film lifeless ... so to speak. But for those interested in the antiquity of the occult, or Poe in particular, this film will excite like no other.", "A stranger called Allan (Charles Lamy) goes to an inn and requests transportation to the House of Usher. The locals remain reluctant, but he gets a coach to transport him to the place. He is the sole friend of Roderick Usher (Jean Debucourt), who leaves in the eerie house with his sick wife Madeleine Usher (Marguerite Gance) and her doctor (Fournez-Goffard). Madeleine is the beloved muse and model and is being painted by Roderick. When she dies, Roderick does not accept her death, and in a dark night, Madeleine returns.For those like me that have not read the story of Edgar Allan Poe, the conclusion of \"La Chute de la Maison Usher\" is quite confused. However, the Gothic cinematography is very impressive, recalling the German Expressionism. It is amazing how Jean Epstein was able to produce such atmosphere, considering the primitive technology of 1928, with difficulties in lighting, sensibility of films, edition table and portability of cameras. However, the shadows and lights are really amazing in this black and white film. This movie was the first work of Luis Bu\u00f1uel in the cinema industry, working as assistant of Jean Epstein. Just as a curiosity, the resemblance of Charles Lamy with Carlos Alberto Parreira, the coach of the Brazilian soccer team, is incredible. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"A Queda da Casa de Usher\" (\"The Fall of the House of Usher\")", "Wow! Words cannot describe how absolutely magical this film is, but I will try. Its not often that a film will truly captivate me from moment one as this one has, especially in the world of silent film. Its been a long time since I've been glued to the screen in complete rapture. Granted, I like the silent medium and of course I respect it, but usually I watch them as a piece of film history; I see them for what they are and judge them only amongst their peers: other silent films. But this silent film is like no other! There were many times when I felt as though if Guy Maddin were to make a actual serious film this would be it. Anyone who has seen 'Cowards Bend The Knee' or 'Saddest Music In The World' will know what I'm referring to. Throughout the film I kept thinking that it looked \"new\" and was made to look old. Some of the special effects such as the swirling fog were just mesmerizing so much so that I found myself wondering why in our modern day we haven't done something so simple yet effective (at least as compared to the films I've experienced).Even the score that they created for it was incredible. There were some scenes in the beginning of the film, especially ones where Allan was approaching the house, that I didn't think quite fit, but for the rest of the 95% of the film it went along with the action of the film perfectly.While everything in the film is as close to perfect as film gets, I must point out the acting was so well done as to almost bring me to tears. I cant quite explain how that is possible, but it is. Each tiny emotion shows through so remarkably well. I really would love to commend the actor who played Roderick Usher for his wonderful display. I even feel right in comparing his acting to the likes of the female lead in 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc' -- and thats hard to beat!Oh, and the cinematography! Its absolutely impeccable! And I'm not just saying that due to the fact that \"its the best they could do back then\". It really could rival any modern day film in that regard. It makes me miss shots of a large looming building from down below instead of the aerial helicopter shots most films use now; so macabre and eerily inviting. This film was definitely ahead of its time thats for sure.I'm not sure how much a screenplay translates to a silent film, but whatever/however Bunuel contributed, it definitely worked. Even though there weren't any overtly surrealistic things going on, you could definitely smell the Bunuel in it. The film is like a dream that you don't want to wake up from even though at its heart it is a nightmare.", "As was inevitable, movies of the silent era depended on their imagery in a way that became less important after the introduction of sound. During the same time period there were a number of hugely significant art movements that would influence the relatively new medium of cinema. Art trends such as cubism, dada, expressionism and surrealism had enormous impact on films of the time. The Fall of the House of Usher is a good example of a film based on 19th century literature but brought to the screen via the artistic sensibilities of the day, namely expressionism and surrealism. Because of this, like its peers such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu, it has attained a timeless quality and it will always remain a fascinating art-horror film.The plot-line such that it is, is about a man named Allan who visits his friend Roderick Usher at his remote mansion. Usher lives with his sick wife Madeline, who suffers from some mysterious unknown disease. He is obsessed in painting a portrait of her. She dies and Usher, unable to accept it, descends into madness.The tone is definitely downbeat and this is reflected by the gloomy haunting imagery used throughout. The strikingly inventive visuals escalate as the film progresses as a way of reflecting Roderick Usher's journey into insanity. Billowing curtains, close-ups of a giant pendulum, a haunting painting of Usher's wife, a moon-lit trip to the mausoleum and swirling mist are just some of the details captured. The film is overloaded in creepy Gothic atmosphere. Production design is excellent, with the grounds of the mansion populated with dead trees and swirling mist, while the interior has enormously high ceilinged rooms decorated with mirrors, curtains and Gothic furniture. In keeping with the film's artistic bent, everything is photographed quite excellently with many close-ups and unusual angles. The overall feeling of the film is that of a fever-dream which is very much in keeping with the central character's damaged state of mind.In the best silent films, the storyline is very much secondary to the ambiance. The Fall of the House of Usher is no different and is one of the greatest silent horror films. It's an often quite stunning mood piece and comes highly recommended.", "Fall of the House of Usher, The (1928)*** (out of 4)One of two versions of the classic Poe tale released in 1928. The other one was an American version, which I enjoyed earlier this year. This version, directed by Jean Epstein and written by Luis Bunuel, comes from France but employs various techniques that we saw in early German horror films. The story is basically the same as Roderick Usher (Jean Debucourt) is haunted by the ghost of his wife. The screenplay takes a few liberties with the story but the story here really isn't important. The main thing going for the film is its surreal nature, which includes some brilliant camera-work as well as some wonderful eerie atmosphere. The visual look of this film is very impressive but I think that also lends to its shortcoming. I think a little more detail to the story would have helped but in all this is another wonderful gem of the silent era. I've also got the 1948 British version sitting here to watch before the month is over.", "I've read the Poe source for this film more times than I can remember, and Epstein's film captures that story's sense of decay and degeneracy the best by far.  Corman's version can't hold a candle to this film; in fact, I feel as if I'm doing a grave disservice to Epstein's work by mentioning Corman's film in the same sentence with it.  Let it pass.Although I'd read about Epstein's USHER for many years and pondered the stills, particularly of the Lady Madeline in her billowing, winding sheet, I was not at all prepared for the terrifying beauty and hypnotic delirium of this motion picture.It's certainly not for all tastes, and, for those not particularly well-read in outre or occult literature, it will be inscrutable.  But for those with an open mind and an appreciation of convulsive beauty, it's hard to find a more exquisite film.", "I had the chance to see this film about 20 years ago and it's still quite fresh in my mind (if you knew me you'd find this very unusual). I still remember how I was wrapping myself up during the course of the film as I was feeling colder and colder - it was a summer night, mind you.The plot sticks tightly to the original story and it shows France's affinity with Edgar Allan Poe since it was the great Charles Beaudelaire himself who translated Poe's work into French.The film manages to create an unusual sense of discomfort unlike most classic horror films where the settings etc. result more in a feeling of (uneasy) cosiness. The insanity in Roderick Usher's face is utterly believable as well as the parts of the other characters. What tops it all up is the constant draught in the mansion. Wall hangings are steadily moving and bits of paper and dust are blowing through the corridors. Hence the above mentioned feeling of physical coldness.All I can say is I need to see this film again and I would be grateful if anyone could point me in the right direction (Quelq'un en France, peut-etre?).", "This memorable adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" is particularly impressive in its use of visuals and in the macabre, disorienting atmosphere that it creates, which fits in well with the story. Jean Epstein made some rather significant changes to the story, but as a movie it all works very well.The story changes the central relationship between Roderick and Madeline, and in so doing discards some of Poe's themes, but adds some new ones of its own. Likewise there are other differences as the story unfolds, but Epstein had his own consistent conception of the possibilities in the story, so that it's neither better nor worse than Poe's idea, just different - they are both creative and fascinating conceptions in their own way.The settings and visual effects are very effective in establishing the atmosphere, and in setting off some of the themes of the story. Some of them, such as the enormous array of flickering candles by which Roderick works, are used as recurring images, with surprisingly haunting results. The pace with which the images come at the viewer is also used as part of the effect. It's quite a distinctive accomplishment, and it's a movie that you won't forget for a while.", "First and foremost: I love the tale of \"House of Usher\", regardless of which film version, and I try to encourage as many people as humanly possible to check out this haunting story of agony and Gothic damnation \u0085 So, I swear, if one more person replies me with: \"Usher? \u0085 Oh, you mean the R&B singer? Yeah, he's cool\", then I swear I will go Edgar Allan Poe on his/her ass! Thank you.Admittedly I'm not much of an art connoisseur, but I reckon this silent classic is pure and genuine art! It's a stunningly beautiful, haunting, surreal and absorbing impressionistic interpretation of Poe's short story. The plot is undeniably subsequent to the atmosphere and choreography, and I actually don't recognize the storyline from the other versions I've seen. In the other versions, for example the awesome Roger Corman production starring the almighty Vincent Price, the Usher kinship is cursed and continuously being punished for the crimes committed by their evil ancestors. Here, it's actually just Sir Roderick Usher who's obsessed with painting a portrait of his lovely wife Madeleine, only \u0085 The nearer the painting comes to completion, the more his wife weakens due to a strange illness. After her death and burial service, Sir Roderick becomes increasingly mad with the restless ghost of his Madeleine still prowling through the house. The story is often confusion and open for various interpretations, but the wholesome is just downright visually stunning! Director Jean Epstein, with the more than noticeable influence of his young and upcoming assistant director Louis Bu\u00f1uel, generates an atmosphere that is morbid, depressing and hypnotic from start to finish and multiple sequences are hauntingly surreal; like the funeral march and the storm. I watched the 1997 restored version, during a special film festival where there was a professional pianist providing live musical guidance, and it was one of the most culturally engaged moments of my life. Art like this will surely survive for yet another hundred years.", "One of the benefits of knowing Dave Sindelar (of sci-film.org and the \"Movie of the Day\" forum on the \"Monsterkidsclassichorrorforum\" on Yuku) is that sometimes I get to see some stuff I never would have know about otherwise.Well, I mean good stuff as well as the deservedly obscure stuff.He pulled out this fairly short film recently as a break from all the 50's sci-fi dreck we've been wading through, and I have to say that this silent film was easily the single best example of the era that I've ever seen.This director and the casting crew managed to cast and film a group of actors who were superbly suited for the demands of silent film...and by this, I mean that all you have to do is look at the actors in almost any given scene and you will already know almost everything there is to know about their characters. This is way different from the hammy over-emoting that jars my sensibilities even when I view something like the recently restored \"Metropolis Complete\".And the photography and lighting and costuming and set design...they all combine to create and reinforce the atmosphere of Poe's little tale of decadence and dread.Especially impressive is the soundtrack, which seems to combine wire harp, scratching violins, hammered piano and heaven knows what else to provide a background that is at once beautiful, disturbing and haunting.Only 8 stars because the story itself...is extremely annoying in its way, especially after the first 30 minutes. You can't help but wonder if maybe actually having a JOB with stuff to do OUTSIDE would work wonders for the situation. \"THIS is what comes of having too much money and too much time on your hands...\"", "THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER (1928, original title La chute de la maison Usher) is the first adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe story and a classic of silent cinema. Like many of the best silent films of the era, this one's all about the imagery: all close-ups of distorted faces, tombs, billowing curtains, shadowed corners, paintings, swinging pendulums and plenty more besides. In this respect it's almost a compendium of striking scenes linked together by the barest of narratives. Luis Bunuel worked on this both as writer and assistant director, which explains some of the stylisation. The story has been heavily altered from the original but it works a treat and always offers something to enjoy. I caught this one on Youtube in an unfortunately poor quality version.", "This is a stunning piece of visual art, based on the famous Poe story. It takes two characters who are obviously fragile and in despair. When one realizes this film was made in1928, one has to marvel at the cinematic nuances. We are told the story without the more specific plot elements, focusing on the two main characters. Neatly done.", "This is all mood and none the worse for it. Trivia buffs will seek it out because Abel Gance had a supporting role (to say nothing of Marguerite Gance as Madeleine Usher), Luis Bunuel adapted Poe and quit as co-director when he failed to see eye to eye with Epstein. Several posters have praised the music which I found totally inapposite but then what do I know. Jean Debucourt (Roderick) has a long and distinguished career and appeared in some of my favorite French movies - Douce, La Ciel est a vous, Marguerite de la nuite, Madame de, etc - and is suitable restrained for a silent film when 'emoting' was de riguer. Anyone who has read anything of Poe let alone the original story will feel at home with this adaptation despite Epstein's cavalier treatment of the story. Photography, atmos, etc, are right on the money and it's well worth seeking out.", "La Chute de la Maison Usher, or The Fall of the House of Usher as it's know amongst English audiences, starts with Allan (Charles Lamy) heading for the Castle of his good friend Sir Roderick Usher (Jean Debucourt) who sent him a letter saying that his wife Madeleine is ill. Once there Allan finds Madeleine very sick & her husband Roderick determined & almost obsessed to paint her portrait. As Roderick paints Madeleine becomes weaker & weaker almost as if the picture is draining the life out of her, Allan tries to help his friend but tragedy soon strikes...This French production was co-written, produced & directed by Jean Epstein & was the second of two filmed The Fall of the House of Usher adaptations during 1928, honestly I don't know the original novel was published in 1839, I mean you wait 89 years for a filmed adaptation & two come along at the same time! Anyway, I feel that I have a bit of a problem here as I have read plenty of positive comments about La Chute de la Maison Usher & maybe I'm not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but I have to say that it simply didn't do anything for me. I didn't like it, obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film & therefore it relies on imagery but even so I thought the story was weak, I thought as a whole the film was boring & dull even though it only lasts for about an hour & it really didn't do anything for me at all. La Chute de la Maison Usher was made almost 80 years ago & that is literally a lifetime, the world, cinema & tastes have moved on a lot since then & I found no enjoyment in this film. I feel this film has dated badly & probably wasn't that good to start with anyway. I never felt for any of the character's, I never cared about anything that was happening & I found it all rather tedious to sit through, I'm sorry if I've offended any silent film fans out there but that's the way I felt.Director Epstein does an OK job, a lot of people ramble on about the imagery in La Chute de la Maison Usher & I will freely admit it definitely has it's moments but I thought they were few & far between. Shots of people's mouths moving & not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me, I didn't like the music & the version I saw kept the original French language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick French accent which was also off putting. Based on the story by Edgar Allen Poe I doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements, stick with the fantastic Roger Corman House of Usher starring Vincent Price.Technically the film was OK considering when it was made. You simply cannot tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try & suggest emotions or reflect what's happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit daft.La Chute de la Maison Usher will appeal to those who crave a bygone era, who live in caves or who are stuck in the past, for me I like my films to have a story, not to bore me & to have sound & I'm sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an uneducated idiot but that's how I feel. The world has moved on since 1928 & for the better.", "First of all, due to the age of the film it does feel a bit dated in some respects. And it's not about the fact, that there is no audio dialog, rather written text box slided every now and then (if you've seen a few older \"silent\" movies, you know what I mean), but the film itself, the pictures. All that is down to pictures per second, which make movies seem \"akward\" nowadays (you can find articles about that if you search for them).Setting all that aside, it's a powerful story and therefor a powerful movie. I did attend a screening though that was a modernized version. They put modern music over the whole music which not only felt wrong, but was wrong. That particular screening/movie would've gotten a maximum of 3 points from me, but I'm not letting that influence my voting as you can see. I'm just warning you not to watch that version yourself, because it is really horrible and out of tune ... literally. Watch the original, even if it has edits and pictures that you are used to by know, because they have been done so many times ... remember: this is (one of the examples) where they set the blueprints for things to come", "From the eerie opening where a stranger comes in from the mist and mud to ask for safe passage to the house of Usher, to the fiery ending where said house comes crashing down, this film is a strange piece of surrealism - using animals, pictures, and extreme close-ups to drive the story along.'The Fall of the House of Usher' has just three characters taking the main roles in the film - the stranger, who has been asked to visit his friend and the friend's dying wife - the friend, Sir Roderick Usher, a wild-eyed loner struck with the passion to paint, and his wife, Madeleine, who has a slow death with every brush stroke inflicted by her husband, while the painting of her lives and breathes.When Madeleine finally dies she's buried in her veil and dress in a coffin, but after a lot of tension (shown by bells and clocks counting time) we find she's not really dead but just walking wounded in spirit. By the time we reach the blazing close of this short film (only an hour) it has done Poe's story proud - a silent classic of Surrealism.", "**minor spoilers**In my room right now is a paperback collection of Poe's stories, which contains the Fall of the House of Usher. From that, and the summaries I've read, the text is more darker and more sinister than this movie, which says a lot.The movie does a good job of capturing the mood of the text with scant words, translating an entire short story into little more than twenty or so inter-title screens. Surprisingly eerie shots of Roderick's face, billowing curtains, a haunting soundtrack and Madeline's degenerating form create a sense of dread and macabre. Certain scenes involving cats and toads highlight the dread and unnatural nature of the Usher state in a comical way. And what can only be described as a weird cross between a getting' crunk hip hop video and a Satanic ritual works surprisingly well to highlight the plodding nature of time and arduous task at hand, as well as being unique for the sake of being unique. However, besides the Usher's creepiness and the amicability of the narrator/Allan (a true friend till the end), I didn't know what to think or make of the characters until the end.The slightly more optimistic twist of the original story brings everything together and creates sympathy for the weird characters by demonizing the house even more. It's a prison driving them mad, not the Usher's parasitic relationship. See this if you want a relatively happy variation of Poe's stories that works well. I think this film is incredibly accessible, a lot more than the text anyway.Goods: the dread and spookiness, close up shots of the objects in the house, a positive spin on things, \"hip-hop\" coffin Bads: the first third... and the general direction less aim of the characters may put you off a bit at first, but the movie is only an hour long", "A moody and atmospheric reworking of Edgar Allan Poe's famous story from Jean Epstein that works hard to create a strong sense of foreboding. Its' avant-garde take on Poe's Gothic horror proves to be unexpectedly incompatible, however, and the sense that Epstein is interested only in dazzling us with his artistry is overwhelming.", "Poe's 'Tales of Mystery and Imagination' have proved to be an abundant source of material for film and the most adapted are 'Murders in the Rue Morgue' and 'Fall of the House of Usher'. The former has been treated very shabbily by film-makers and each adaptation seems to me infinitely worse than the one before. The latter has fared slightly better however.Roger Corman's version of 1960 has excellent production values and a riveting performance by Vincent Price as Roderick Usher but is weakened alas by the insertion of the obligatory Hollywood 'love interest'. There is a truly bizarre English version from 1950 that boasts some stunning visual effects but is marred by some of the naffest acting I have ever had the misfortune to witness. The thirteen-minute American avant -garde version of 1928, despite its dazzling images, remains an exercise in style. Jean Epstein came from the avant-garde but in his version from the same year he has transcended that style and given us what is, atmospherically speaking, arguably the finest Poe ever filmed.Some have criticised the film because of Epstein's changes and much has been made, probably too much, of the artistic differences which caused adaptor Luis Bunuel to quit the film. The major change is that in order to avoid the suggestion of incest Madeline has become Roderick's wife rather than his 'tenderly beloved sister'. No doubt Bunuel would have preferred the original concept!This might very well be 'bad' Poe but remains brilliant film-making. The directorial touches and the cinematic inventiveness are breathtaking, combining Surrealism and elements of German Expressionism whilst the art direction of Pierre Kefer is of the highest quality. As for the newly added score however, the jury is still out, for this viewer at any rate.Madeline is played by Abel Gance's wife at the time, Marguerite and her character in this is as insubstantial as in Poe's story. Roderick is here given a marvellous interpretation by the young Jean Debucourt who suggests incipient madness with great sublety. He went on of course to become one of France's finest character actors, working with the greatest directors as well as being a luminary of the Comedie Francaise.The 'horror' genre is eminently suited to silent film where images are more effective than words. This is not only the pinnacle of Epstein's silent oeuvre, its influence on later Gothic horrors is there for all to see.", "A very influential movie in its time, mainly for its imaginative cinematography and cutting.The story itself is hard to follow, but not very important since the movie has more essence than substance.The opening scene of the peasants cringing hearing that someone wants to visit the Ushers is later reused many times (i.e., in Dracula).", "Whether one is an avid aficionado of the silent era or a casual moviegoer there's no disputing that from a simple standpoint of technical capability, some titles come off better in the twenty-first century than others. I mean no disrespect to this one when I say that in some regards it shows its age: the fundamental image quality is less than pristine; there are rough edges in action on-screen owing to issues of frame rate and sequencing; the imagery at large is perhaps less sophisticated than we see even in some of this picture's contemporaries. Be that as it may, such an early film deserves remembrance and preservation simply as a part of cultural history, and regardless, there's so much to admire here. Even if some detail becomes lost due to basic fuzziness in the visuals, the production design and art direction as we see them are terrific, above all in emphasizing the vastness of the Usher estate, and its interminable gloom. Those effects that are employed look great in and of themselves, and further the building sense of unease that this rendition of Edgar Allan Poe's tale inculcates. Meanwhile, though maybe not as wholly remarkable as we've seen elsewhere even among early features, filmmaker Jean Epstein illustrates a keen eye for artful shot composition, and the editing is notably sharp at some points, too. Even Georges and Jean Lucas demonstrate a brilliance and somewhat unconventional tack (by 1920s' standards) in much of their cinematography, in their own manner lending to the ambience with an oblique feeling of personal presence and witness to the proceedings.Yes, other interpretations (not least Vincent Price's in 1960) have been more immediately striking in one way or another. But still Epstein's 'The fall of the house of Usher' ('La chute de la maison Usher') boasts plentiful value of its own as it capitalizes on the broad airs of eeriness and ill tidings. How much of this creation can be credited to Epstein's vision, and how much to fellow pioneering filmmaker Luis Bu\u00f1uel prior to his departure from the project, seems to remain a matter of uncertainty, but either way this 1928 movie ably crafts an overarching aura of disquiet as the story progresses. Taking some liberties with the source material, the screenplay does a fine job in the first half of juxtaposing Roderick's obsession with Madeline's condition, to undeniably unnerving effect. At least as much if not more true than has been the case with other adaptations, in the latter half the notes of tragedy and grief are slyly, somewhat subtly twisted into disturbing beats of horror, preceded by and accented with instances of rapid and/or quietly haunting imagery that heightens the tense mood. From the root conjuration to its realization with Epstein's guidance, from all the work contributed from behind the scenes to the dramatic, hollow, perturbed performances of the cast, this picture rather discretely evokes its genre core with a strength and vibrancy that some of its contemporary kin lack, or even some successors. It may be unsophisticated compared to what horror would go on to achieve in the 70s, 80s, and beyond, yet by the same token, there's tremendous value herein that countless other titles can't begin to match.It doesn't necessarily achieve the same level of macabre grandeur throughout its whole length; there are sparing tinges of lag along the way. Much more so than not 'La chute de la maison Usher' stands surprisingly, fabulously tall, however, and plentiful moments across these sixty-some minutes come off as a delightful spark of ingenuity. In fact, I'm inclined to even draw a line from Epstein to modern master of horror John Carpenter: from 'Halloween' and 'The fog' to 'The thing' and 'In the mouth of madness,' Carpenter's forte as director was in fostering an intense, pervasive atmosphere matching the tenor of his narratives. If to a degree that's less immersive, that's exactly what Epstein accomplished here. If that's not a high compliment for a silent film, then I don't know what is. I can understand why some modern viewers have difficulty engaging with older features and I'd have said the same of myself at one time. For whatever limitations this production faced, however, and for whatever earnest critiques one might make, by and large it's a robust, entrancing slice of early genre work that holds up much more than even I anticipated. Substantial care and skill went into this from all involved, and it shows: 'The fall of the house of Usher' is as fine in this 1928 Silver Screen adaptation as it was in Poe's prose ninety years before, and even in 2023 it's well worth checking out if one has the opportunity.", "A screening in this year's Shanghai International Film Festival, prior to Epstein's feature, it is a riveting experience to watch Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed's 21-minute juvenilia UN CHIEN ANDALOU (1929) on the silver screen, an archetypal surrealist disjecta membra takes its ideological and visual flights to an insuperable height, the incontrovertible forefather of experimental cinema, unprecedentedly deconstructing the subconscious undertow of human psyche. Its quixotic montages can still bowl audience over no matter how many times you are primed for its iconic razor-cutting scene in the prologue.In THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER, adapted from Edgar Allan Poe's famed short story, a young Bu\u00f1uel is credited as a co-screenwriter, but Epstein's aesthetic trademark as a master of atmospherics holds court here, an expressionist corpse bride horror, is panned out in its excruciatingly glacial pace (at least for a modern-day viewer), but graced by a hauntingly emotive score and Epstein's cracking legerdemain pertaining to the cinematic mobility of \"les meubles\", inside the titular unheimlich mansion, where resides Sir Roderick Usher (Debucourt) and his dying wife Madeleine (a gaunt Marguerite Gance) (in the novel they are siblings), Allan (Lamy), a friend of Roderick, nominally takes the position as the interloper, is involuntarily thrust into a paranormal revelation when a soul transmigrates, mortality subverted, and perdition betides upon the house of Usher, albeit its inevitably archaic special effects when the crunch hits.Configuring its simplistic story with an extraordinary sense of visual and logic fluidity, Epstein basks in the narrative's eerie ambient building, rendering it with mind-bending superimposition, and burrowing deep into Roderick's stream of consciousness on the strength of Debucourt's perfervid impression, all mentioned above is vividly presented in its monochromatic flair with original fidelity, speaks volumes of Epstein and co.'s avant-garde artistic progression and undimmed cinematic prowess.", "One of the visionary masterpieces of the silent For the fact that the visionary gist is perfectly conveyed by the silent films testimonies also the fact that we can not envisage them as bettered or modified for the better by the mechanical addition of the sound. The silent, in what is most interesting for me, was an art of the visionary and the ghostly \u0096hence, the note of eeriness, enhanced by the non\u0097realist nature of the representations. BERLING, ARNE, USHER, NOSFERATU were mere music, poetry\u0097while CALIGARI is an anecdote, an overstretched and uneconomical sketch that sorely needs dialogs, lacks precision and brio\u0097and seems VERY talkative. The silent was fit like any other medium for eerie, disturbing, chilling subjects. Its means served these flawlessly and wholly, completely. How fine, how kind, how good is for the mind this art. How compact is the poetry, the poetic nature of these movies! (I know, though perhaps not better than you do, that the silent meant also comedy, slapstick, farce, western, silly melodramas, etc.\u0097but the are wholly irrelevant aesthetically, and collateral. The silent built primarily an art of the eerie, chilling, unusual and visionary\u0097of high, hallucinatory romanticism . The later visionary and eerie achievements of Hitchcock and Clouzot, in the '50s, will mean an entirely different approach and aim.) This USHER, movie of a rich and resplendent melodiousness, towering art of the time and of gradual modulations, is one of the best,say,30 movies ever created. This beauty, eerie and weird, is tangible\u0097it does not consist of ,say, effects\u0097in the sense of aiming at fooling the audiences with a senseless bravado; it is an art clean, sincere, good-natured and intense. As a form of art, the silent is kindred with the sound movies, yet essentially distinct and autonomous. Aesthetically, it was much honest\u0097lacking the tempting chance of offering surrogates of realism by way of talkative footage. It could not be gross the way a talking film\u0097say, a Scorsese film\u0097is gross and inert, lifeless.In a sense, the sound only polluted and impoverished the film, deprived it of its core of magic and of 3\u0097D eeriness\u0097again, see BERLING, USHER, NOSFERATU and ARNE.(As a historical note, that adds substantially nothing to what I have already written, let us remind Epstein's bitter and acid remark that the talking cinema has become the talkative cinema. Epstein continued to shoot movies throughout the sound era, the '30s and '40s\u0097but I do not know any of them ,so cannot comment upon. The man also wrote several first\u0097class cinema books, one of them is available for free on the net. He was one of the great grammarians of the cinema\u0097and one of its inspired visionaries, in his unbridled creation, as well \u0085.)"], "tt0019130": ["A young boy is terribly disfigured by roving gypsies by the order of King James II of England as a punishment to one of his disobeying nobles.  The gypsies carve a permanent smile in the young boy's face and then leave him for dead as they leave for their homeland.  The young boy wanders aimlessly for shelter amidst the cold coastline filled with snow, ruins, and swinging bodies from the hangman's noose in the background.  Here he finds an infant..alive..clutched in the frozen hands of a woman whose husband was hanged.  This was the beginning of The Man Who Laughs...and it was so powerfully filmed that a race of emotions filled me as I watched awe-struck, yet horrified.  Paul Leni directed this great film based on the novel by Victor Hugo.  Conrad Veidt plays the grown Gwynplaine who travels around the English countryside with his adopted parent Ursus the Philosopher and the young Dea, the girl whose life he saved as a baby.  Dea has turned into a blooming young woman, yet blind from her birth. Dea is played very nicely by Mary Philbin, who played in The Phantom of the Opera(1925) in the female lead. The way Leni has the characters interact is very effective.  We can feel the tension in Veidt's character as he submits to the growing pains of love.  We feel his sorrow as he cries through smiles.  The rest of the film involves a royal plot by the queen and her henchman/jester(by the way, Brandon Hurst does a phenomenal job as this cruel heartless jester) to reinstate some royal property to Gwynplaine so he can be married to a duchess that the queen does not like.  The story is pretty good and one can see where it is going early on, but the way Leni creates suspense and pathos overpowers any negative defects.  The acting all around is very strong. This is a powerful film on many levels.  It is an emotional rollercoaster ride through love, hate, despair, joy, and much more.  I laughed; I cried. The best part though was that the film has a marvelous message about perceptions.  Here we have this character Gwynplaine that smiles outwardly and makes people laugh, but he is full of despair.  He cries on the inside. People should not always be taken at face value.   By the way, Bob Kane, the creator of Batman, credits this film and the character of Gywnplaine for his creation of the Joker.  I can see how.  Watch this and the silent version of The Bat in the same evening and you will see what stirred a young Bob Kane's imagination.", "Like most artistic \"isms,\" expressionism is somewhat difficult to define; in general, however, it refers to a style in which the artist is much less interested in capturing external realities than in portraying emotional and psychological states; consequently, expressionism is often fantastic in a visual sense--and when it combined with the darker edges of Germanic folklore it gave rise to a series of classic and near-classic silent films, including THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, NOSFERATU, THE GOLEM, and WAXWORKS.Over time, the style began to creep into American film. This was most particularly true of films made at Universal Studios, which had major successes with such Gothic-inflected films as THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, both of which starred Lon Chaney. Drawn from a minor work by Victor Hugo, THE MAN WHO LAUGHS was first intended as a Chaney vehicle; by the time it began production, however, Chaney had decamped to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer--and Universal assigned Conrad Veidt to the starring role under director Paul Leni. Both men had been deeply involved in the German expressionist movement, and the resulting film was a melodrama so deeply steeped in the grotesque that it came to be regarded as a horror film.THE MAN WHO LAUGHS concerns a child named Gwynplaine who is caught up in royal intrigue and is deliberately disfigured, his mouth cut into a ghastly, inflexible grin. Abandoned, he rescues an blind infant girl; both are taken in by the kindly Ursus (Cesare Gravina.) Years later, and entirely unaware of his aristocratic origin, Gwynplaine (Veidt) and the beautiful blind maiden Dea (Mary Philbin) are popular carnival actors, appearing in a play written by Ursus--but although he loves Dea, Gwynplaine is deeply humiliated by his eternal grin and feels he can never marry. Ironically, it is not until he is once more caught up in a royal powerplay and recognized as a peer that he realizes the depth of Dea's love.In some ways the plot is simplistic and occasionally too much so, but the look of the thing is relentlessly fascinating. Director Leni endows his world with grotesque faces, vulgar sexuality, and deliberately twisted visuals--particularly so in the first half of the film, which is greatly famous for the sequence in which the abandoned child stumbles through a snow storm beneath gallows bearing rotting corpses to find the infant Dea. Veidt's hideous grin, an early creation by make up genius Jack Pierce, is remarkably effective; the performances are memorable, and although the second half of the film is excessively predictable the whole thing goes off with a bang.Although it was hardly a failure, in 1928 THE MAN WHO LAUGHS proved too gruesome for many audiences, and the rise of sound films drove it into a too-rapid obscurity. Even so, it would cast a very long shadow: it is an important link in the chain between German expressionism and the great Hollywood horror classics of the early 1930s. The Kino DVD presents a reasonable but far from flawless transfer of the film, along with several bonus features, most significantly a \"making of\" documentary that details the film's stylistic importance. Recommended for fans of classic horror.GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "In 1690, in England, the nobleman Lord Clancharlie returns from his exile to see his young son. The peer is captured by the cruel King James II and before being killed, he is informed that his beloved son had been sold to the gypsies Comanchicos that carved a permanent grin on his face. The Cormanchicos abandon the boy in the cold snowing winter, and while looking for shelter, he finds a baby hold in the arms of her dead mother. He brings the baby with him and they are welcomed by the philosopher Ursus (Cesare Gravina), who finds that the baby is blind and raises them. Years later, Gwynplaine (Conrad Veidt) becomes a successful clown, and together with the blind Dea (Mary Philbin), they present plays for common people. Gwynplaine and Dea are in love for each other, but he refuses to marry her because of his ridiculous appearance. When the evil jester Barkilphedro (Brandon Hurst) discloses the origin of Gwynplaine, he plots a means to be rewarded by the Queen, jeopardizing the love of Gwynplaine and Dea.The Man Who Laughs\" is a magnificent classic based on the famous Victor Hugo's novel. The performances of Conrad Veidt and Brandon Hurst are amazing and there are many touching and heartbreaking scenes. My eyes became wet when the artists act like the audience cheering for Gwynplaine to spare Dea from the truth. The appearance of the character Gwynplaine inspired Bob Kane in the creation of \"The Joker\", one of Batman's greatest enemies. Another point that I would like to highlight is the resemblance of Madonna, in the beginning of her career, with the Russian actress Olga Baclanova, who performs daring scenes including of nude with her amoral character of Duchess Josiana. I have never read Victor Hugo's novel, but it seems that the conclusion in the original story is less optimistic than in this movie, but anyway I loved this film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"O Homem Que Ri\" (\"The Man Who Laughs\")", "A lord refuses to kiss the hand of King James II, so is doubly punished: he perishes in the \"Iron Lady\" [onscreen in a memorably handled sequence] while his son is sent to a surgeon who [offscreen] carves a grin on his face \"so he can forever laugh at his father\". Sheltered by a kindly playwright [\"like Shakespeare, only much better!\"], the boy grows up to join his troupe of itinerant players as the star attraction: \"The Man Who Laughs\". His fortunes lead him to a blind girl, an ambitious duchess, and Queen Anne, who reinstates him to the nobility, but with further complications.Conrad Veidt, in a career stretching from CALIGARI to CASABLANCA, always found the emotional authenticity in bizarre roles. Here, in the familiar 19th century figure of the suffering clown, his performance is transfixing: whether tremulous as the girl's hand explores his face, or mortified by the laughter of the House of Lords, Veidt's face makes the role more than a simple martyr: he is man struggling with unjust destiny [\"A king made me a clown, a queen made me a lord, but first God made me a man!\"].Big-hearted and unashamedly dramatic, this is clearly the work of Victor Hugo, rags to riches in scope, offering consolation in love. The spirit of the French Revolution is very much in the air in this world of cruel privilege and class antagonism, full of secret doors, dungeons, and volatile mobs. While not as richly populated as Les Miserables and Hunchback, this adaptation still has spectacular set-pieces and elaborate settings.Considerably less revolutionary is the conventional portrayal of women: virgin and vamp are the only alternatives. The former is the blind girl played by Mary Philbin [who had earlier unmasked Lon Chaney's Phantom]. With blond ringlets arranged to make her face heart-shaped, she edges close to simpering yet rises to genuinely moving moments. The vamp is Olga Baclanova [who became the blonde tormentor in Tod Browning's FREAKS], here writhing around in a black negligee and looking startlingly like Madonna.Today, the films of Paul Leni are hard to track down, but worth the effort. Starting as an art director, Leni developed his visual command in Berlin; this Germanic style stands out in some beautifully designed compositions, such as a dynamic night sequence: a ship, full of gypsies being deported, heaves through a furious snowstorm. Yet Leni always works at the heart of the human values in the story, sustaining intense moments for all his actors. While some scenes are staged in darkness to rival a film noir, Leni also floods Veidt and Philbin with light, often focusing on one nuance per shot, an old-fashioned but effective strategy.Filmed on the cusp of the sound revolution, this semi-silent has added sound effects and rather vague non-stop music but no spoken dialogue.", "I always think that Paul Leni's \"The Man Who Laughs\" was another silent horror piece with a lot of good ideas and thrilling scenes. Well... i was not wrong, except in the \"horror\" thing, and I lack to think of the beauty that could give me. Actually, \"The Man Who Laughs\" is one of the best silent films (With \"Broken Blossoms\" and \"Metropolis\") that i have ever seen ever. As too one of the most beautiful films that i have ever seen too.\"The Man Who Laughs\", based on Victor Hugo's novel, told us the story of Gwynplaine (Great performance of Conrad Veidt, who too appeared as Cesare in famous \"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", participate in the first gay themed film in history \"Diffrent from the Others\" and \"Casabalanca\") a man that, when he was little, was operated by an evil man and now, his face always have a long smile. When he was little, he finds a death mother with a newly born one, a beautiful girl, but she is blind. Then he finds help, home and food with Ursus. Years later, he grown up, as the lovely girl, now a beautiful woman named Dea. With Ursus (Now, he is old) go with a fair. For their side there is the evil Barkilpehdro, who was the responsible of our dear main character's sad circumstances. This evil character do it for one thing, power... Gwynplaine doesn't know that he could be a powerful man. Now, back with Gwynplaine, we find a big saddest by him, he don't want to be a clown. And Dea is the only person who see the real Gwynplane. Then we find the story of a beautiful but evil and rebel duchess (Perfomed perfectly by Olga Baclanova, who appeared too in \"Freaks\"),she has as pupil: the evil Barkilphedro. So, what do you think that happen if all this characters find them in a fair? Just watch it out, and be prepared, because is a thrilling experience.In my personal opinion, \"The Man Who Laughs\" is an important piece of the history of cinema, maybe , of their time too. First of all, the love story is so tender, so beautiful... that i don't think yet that exist such movie!!! Then, the stages, all the scenario is perfect, makes us to feel what it wants. Is here too another personal opinion, i think that \"The Man Who Laughs\" it was early to their time, Paul Leni (Director of \"The Cat and the Cannary\" and \"Waxworks\"). Its just that the movie present topics that in that time was very difficult to show, or was too (talkin about film technique) novel, or in other word: new. For example, there is a scene when a man watch through the bolt of a door to the duchess taking a bath, yes it doesn't show her nude, but certainly, what they show it was much for this time, i think. In film technique i can give a lot of examples, for example, mix of sounds in a lot of scenes, camera moves... etc... i can put a lot of examples. In few words, \"The Man Who Laughs\" is a real masterpiece, a real must see. This is a beautiful film, and i loved it. Try to see it if you have not see it yet. If you love excellent films, if you love silent films, if you love beautiful films, if you love thrilling films, if you love touching films... you must see \"The Man Who Laughs\"*Sorry for the mistakes, well... if there any.", "I watched ''The Man Who Laughs'' just yesterday, curious to see the character that bob Kane based to create the famous villain from the Batman series, The Joker.This movie, originally a novel by Victor Hugo,takes place in England from the seventeenth century, when a young son from a nobleman is sold to the gypsies Compranchicos(illegal child buyers) that carved a permanent grin on his face. The boy, named Gwynplaine, is abandoned in the cold snowing winter, and while looking for a shelter, he finds a baby hold in the arms of her dead mother. He takes the baby with him and finds a nice play to stay with an old man called Ursus, that raises the baby,who he discover that is blind, and Gwynplaine. Many years later, Gwynplaine works as a clown together with the blind Dea, that was the little baby he saved. They are both in love with each other, but since Gwynplaine is always considered a joke by the people because of his grin, he thinks that Dea deserves someone better then him to marry. But when secrets about Gwynplaine's blood are known by the Queen's jester, his pacific life is going to change for good.The story of the romance between Gwynplaine and Dea, remembers me a lot the story of the romance between Cyrano and Roxane( from ''Cyrano de Bergerac''), where Cyrano, too embarrassed by his large nose and ugly appearance, refuses to tell the beautiful Roxane about his feelings for her. Not only the ugly looks and the love for a beauty, but also the fact that both Cyrano and Gwynplaine are good people, makes these characters very similar in many ways to me.", "This silent horror gem doesn't get many viewings.  Conrad Viedt, in his best film role plays an unfortunate memeber of royality whose mouth is carved in a horrific grin.  He winds up in a circus sideshow, where gawkers marvel at his eternal grin. However, Viedt does such a wonderful performance here, especially with the fact he has the limitation of expressing inner anquish with eye movements. After the sideshow episode, he falls in love with a blind girl, (Mary Philbin, recently menaced by \"The Phantom Of The Opera\") who can't see his grostesque mouth.  Paul Leni, who died of blood poisioning in 1931, keeps the pace of the film active.  The late Bob Kane, creator of \"Batman\" claims Viedt's character was the inspiration for The Joker.", "In jolly old England, Julius Molnar Jr. (as young Gwynplaine) has a permanent grin surgically carved on his face \"so he might laugh forever at his fool of a father\" who refused to kiss the hand of his King. The disfigured lad rescues a blind baby, and they are adopted by fatherly Cesare Gravina (as Ursus). The children grow into Conrad Veidt (as Gwynplaine) and Mary Philbin (as Dea). The trio support themselves as a traveling freak show, featuring Mr. Veidt's \"The Laughing Man\" grin, which has become ever more grotesque with age. Still blind, but movie-star-beautiful as an adult, Ms. Philbin falls for her good-natured rescuer; she thinks God took her eyes so that she could see the good in \"Gwynplaine\". Veidt cares for Philbin, but is distracted by the possible love of a sighted woman, the seductive Olga Baclanova (as Duchess Josiana).Paul Leni's \"The Man Who Laughs\" makes up for a story that goes to the dogs (quite literally!) by being too beautifully produced to dismiss. Additionally, Veidt's performance is electrifying. Especially representative of his work in this film is Veidt's \"seduction\" scene, with Ms. Baclanova; and, she is surely the film's \"Best Supporting Actress\". Everyone, from Philbin to extras and bit players, is very good. Interestingly, Veidt was eligible for an Academy Award, but was not nominated. Then, neither was Lon Chaney, for \"Laugh, Clown, Laugh\". They had no sense of humor, obviously.******** The Man Who Laughs (4/27/28) Paul Leni ~ Conrad Veidt, Mary Philbin, Olga Baclanova, Brandon Hurst", "This was our first Conrad Veidt experience.  The Man Who Laughs is a spellbinding piece of visual art.  Veidt's acting is sensational.  I knew the plot of the story and wondered how he would portray feelings of sadness and regret with a permanent smile carved on his face.  After viewing the tape, we were amazed how the emotions exuded from the TV screen.  This is our second Mary Philbin experience and both of us prefer her acting in this movie to her role in The Phantom of the Opera.We have viewed silents on the TV screen as well as the big screen.  We discovered that there is more of the \"larger than life\" emotions projected and felt by the audience through the larger screenings that is somewhat missed on the 27\" TV screen.  Not so with this performance.  My wife and I were both moved to watch it from the beginning...one more time.", "A most extraordinary movie, filmed on an absolutely staggering scale in the most extravagant yet stylish manner possible by director Paul Leni. Superbly photographed, costumed and set, this handsomely atmospheric horror piece is certainly one of a kind. In its own peculiarly dark niche, I can think of no other competitors, not even Universal's own \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\".This movie has the further advantage of a far superior cast. Mary Philbin betters her portrayal in \"Hunchback\" by a mile, while Conrad Veidt in a Chaney-type role easily steals the picture by sheer charisma rather than simply horrific make-up. Mind you, he is given a good run for his money by Brandon Hurst as the scheming villain, Baclanova as the sexy Josiana, and Josephine Crowell (in her final feature film) as the imperious queen.", "This is a great emotional driven picture! Directed by the German Expressionist filmmaker Paul Leni. The film is an adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel of the same name. The movie tells the story of Gwynplaine (Conrad Veidt), who bears a face disfigured by child torture into a permanent smile, because his noble father refuse to obey the King of England. He makes a living with his adopted father, Ursus (Cesare Gravina) & girlfriend, a beauty blind woman named Dea (Mary Philbin), traveling town to town, performing plays. Upon doing a show at a village fair, Gwynplaine attracts the attention of the bored, sexy, but trouble, duchess Josiana (Olga Baclanova). He soon gains more attention from the royals, after it is found out that Gwynplaine is the son and heir to Lord's position and estate. Now, Gwynplaine must choose, between a life of luxury, without love, or being poor without love. Which one will he choose? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, the movie is very powerful! It exposed the crudity and evil that exist in all of human society. Not only does, it satirically, make fun of the emptiness, immorality and meaninglessness of some of the rich, but it show the silly ugliness of some of the poor when it comes to their sinful acts. Both social classes are shown being devastating wickedness to the weak, downtrodden and disabled, lower forms of society. While, the movie can be, somewhat dark and grit, integrated with this theme is the secondary theme of the conflict between moral and immoral love-love guided by the spirit and love guided by the flesh. Hugo does very well to show that Dea loves Gwynplaine for his kind spirit, but Josiana loves him for his devilish looks. Yet, another theme to come out of this film is the struggles of man-against all the forces in life which seek to destroy his spirit and cow him to go things, against his will. In truth, Gwnplaine does not want to be forced to make a living off, of people making fun of his facial disability, but he also, doesn't want to be forced into an arranged marriage, he doesn't feel comfortable, just to live life in luxury. Gwynplaine is the symbol of the basic problem confronting mankind. He's there, to remind people of all classes, that humans are savage in nature, and that civilization can never be more than an idea. Hugo therefore chooses to him to become a satire mockery of society. A walking joke, that shows, that no matter, how civilize, we are; we are only one foot away from the jungle. Dea is the symbol of ideal love. Based on the recognition of the values held by and virtues of man, totally oblivious of man's physical appearance. Indeed, true love is blind. I just glad, they change the sad ending to a happy ending. Their character really did deserve it, after the things, they went through. Both actors did well with their roles. As much as certain critics, wanted the title role to go to the original actor, plan for this; Lon Chaney. I think Conrad Veidt did the role, much better. Conrad Veidt is captivating as Gwynplaine. The way, he able to show sadness, while smiling is haunting. Despite, what Hollywood lore, may say, Conrad Veidt never replace Lon Chaney, because Chaney storm, out, during production. They choose Conrad Veidt to replace him, because he was a better actor for the role. That shows you, how good Conrad Veidt really was. He is compelling, emotive and unforgettable in his role. Mary Philbin was the same thing. Yes, she doesn't get to do much besides smile and look pretty, but she does realistically portray a blind woman, a definite acting challenge. Her acting really remind me so much of Dorothy Gish in 1921's Orphans of the Storm. She was amazing! Olga Baclanova is very charismatic as Duchess Josiana, alluring, flirtatious and imperious. Her resemblance to modern singer Madonna in The Man Who Laughs, in both looks and attitude, is pretty strange, when you think about it. Brandon Hurst does a phenomenal job as the cruel heartless villain. He was very season. Great performance. One thing, I kinda dislike, about certain modern critics, is how they overlook this film, due to Gwynplaine's appearance. They often classified this film, as a horror movie, due to the heroes' evil looking smile. While, it's true, that the carnival freak-like grin on the character Gwynplaine's face, was a direct inspiration for The Joker character in Batman comic folklore, and yes, the movie does have some dark grotesque moments, like the Iron Maiden scene or the half frozen hanging skeletons, but that's only in the beginning of the film. The rest of the movie, feels like a sex romantic melodrama. Lots of pre-code, near-nudity. There was even some comedy. Stuart Holmes as Lord Dirry-Moir was hilarious. I think, most people mistake the German Expressionism filmmaking style as just a horror film, style. They really forget that some of the most popular film noirs, historic, or Sci-fiction films have this style. Anyways, the film was one of the early silent/sound films. Some copies of this movie does have sound effects on them. Sadly, they're somewhat annoying. The music score that came with this movie, \"When Love Comes Stealing,\" by Walter Hirsch, Lew Pollack, and Erno Rapee is worth checking out. While, the movie is dated. This movie did help influence others films. It even got some modern remakes and some cameos in other films. Overall: This movie is compelling masterpiece. One of the best silent films ever made. The fact that this movie is hardly known today is a shame. The joke is on you, if you haven't saw this film. It's a smiling good time. Go see it! You'll be glad that you did.", "The first time I encountered The Man Who Laughs was a photo in a horror movie catalog that I had when I was a very easily-spooked 8-year-old.  For some reason that grotesque grin frightened me more than the Hunchback, the Phantom of the Opera, and Nosferatu combined.  I couldn't bear to look at it, so I carefully marked the page so that I wouldn't accidentally catch a glimpse of it.  However, if I had actually seen the movie I wouldn't have been frightened at all.  I wouldn't consider The Man Who Laughs a horror movie, but a touching melodrama about a man whose appearance is horrific.Gwynplaine is a very sympathetic, likeable character, and Conrad Veidt does an excellent job of conveying his inner torment and sadness with subtle eye movements and gestures.  Gwynplaine's innate goodness is very clear, despite his macabre appearance.  We root for him to overcome all obstacles to find happiness and true love, as we root for the evil jester Barkilphedro to meet with a bitter end.  We are not disappointed. I was impressed with the beautiful cinematography, which is exceptional for the time.  The score and sound effects are used very well, so well that sometimes you forget that you are watching a silent picture.  With the outstanding performances, particularly Veidt's, this is a classic of silent cinema that deserves to have a much wider audience.", "When Universal found that they had two monumental successes on their hands with \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\", both of whom had for their main characters a being so deformed and hideous, they turned once again to Victor Hugo for what they hoped would be another hit. But Lon Chaney was not available - he had gone to MGM in the meantime and was now established as their top star and they were not about to lend him. The late 1920s saw German expressionism at it's height in Hollywood and the studios at the forefront of the surge were Fox and Universal. So Universal turned to the country of it's founder's birth and in particular a thriller called \"Waxworks\" to find both a new director, Paul Leni, and a star, Conrad Veidt.The very grim Victor Hugo story is about an outlaw band - the dreaded Comprachicos, whose surgeon roves the country carving huge grotesque grins onto young children's faces, forcing them to grow up to become side show freaks. There are some chilling images in the prologue where Gwynplaine, as a child, wanders among bodies and human bones hanging from scaffolds as a blizzard whips up. The little boy then finds the blind Dea clasped in her dead mother's arms. The England that Paul Leni has conjured up is a bleak and haunted world.As the years go on Gwynplaine (Veidt) becomes the \"laughing man\", a strolling player in the troupe of Father Ursus (Cesare Gravina), the one person who didn't turn his back on the orphans, but to Dea (beautiful Mary Philbin), who cannot see his hideous grin, he will always be goodness and light. Chaney could not have bettered Veidt's performance in which his eyes are truly the windows to his soul.At Southwark Fair, one of the sideshow proprietors (George Siegman, a Griffith regular) realises that Gwynplaine is the missing heir to Lord Clancharlie's estates, now taken over by the seductive Duchess Josiana and the ambitious Barkiphedro who had Gwynplaine's father tortured and killed in the \"Iron Lady\" over 20 years before. Olga Baclanova is just a sensation - the censor must have been asleep - she has two nude scenes within her first introduction and she plays a Countess who loves nothing better than donning dirty peasant rags and mingling (and allowing them to take great liberties) with the ruffians down at the fair.The last part of the film is very Griffith influenced (\"Orphans of the Storm\"). Gwynplaine's castle and land have rightfully been restored to him but he is being forced into marriage with the lustful Josiana. Dea (like the blind Louisa in \"Orphans\") is thwarted at every turn until she and Ursus are forced from the city by the power hungry Barkiphedro, then it is Gwynplaine's turn to race through the town. His head was turned by Josiana and in the scene where she strips away his mask and, displaying both lust and loathing, kisses his deformed mouth, there is so much sensuality and passion in her performance, a reviewer at the time commented that \"she burns holes in the screen\".The Kino release that I have features a restored orchestral Movietone soundtrack, complete with a theme song \"When Love Comes Stealing\" that they may have hoped would be as popular as \"7th Heaven's\" \"Diane\" - but it wasn't.", "The Man Who Laughs is one of the best love stories of the silent era and it is in essence the best Lon Chaney movie not starring Lon Chaney. Conrad Veidt gives the performance of his career as Gwynplaine, a man of royal blood who is punished for the sins of his father. He has a horrible grin carved into his face so he is forever smiling on the outside or \"Laughing at his fool of a father\" Gwynplaine is given this horrible scar by the infamous gypsies the Comprachios, he is abandoned by them and is taken in by a carnival traveler called Ursus along with a poor blind baby who is named Dea. Gwynplaine grows up a shattered man with no sense of pride in his life other than his deep love for Dea. He feels as if he doesn't deserve Dea and has to become something more than the \"clown\" the world has cruelly dubbed him as.Geez those who think Gwynplaine is the inspiration for the Joker couldn't be farther from the truth. Visually yes but Gwynplaine is the only truly decent character in this film. The film is also miscorrectly labeled as a horror film, it is actually a tragedy in my opinion. However the classification of a horror film isn't far off, Paul Leni deeply roots the set and make-up design in his natural German Expressionism. The shadows and set designs are beautiful and is really the last example of this masterful method of film-making. No star knows how to better match this than Conrad Veidt, the star of the masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Calagari. This performance is breathtaking, every scene he is in he dominates. His on screen presence is huge and overwhelming in a great way. It's a genuinely touching story and we feel deeply for Gwynplaine when we might not feel as much for other characters.", "One of the things I noticed in viewing this was the tight editing. There is little wasted space. Many of the silent films are presented in jerky photographic moments, with the actors emoting and letting us figure out their motivations. This one begins with a sad event. A revolutionary pays the price of his life for not respecting James II. In addition to his execution, his little son is surgically altered to have a perpetual smile, to become the subject of ridicule, seeming to be laughing. The little boy is cast aside by the Gypsies that did this to him and on his journey finds a dead mother clutching a little baby girl. He seeks refuge in the home of a poet and this launches him on a career as a kind of freak actor. The little girl grows to be a beautiful woman, but she is blind. He feels great love for her, but is afraid that other women either hate him or pity him. He becomes a great celebrity, but is submerged in loneliness and depression, having to go in front of audiences each day to be a clown. Mixed into all this is the fact that he is heir to a great position and becomes a threat to the aristocracy and to the Queen. How this is all sorted out is utterly captivating. There is a little Les Miserables and a little Elephant Man in his portrayal. A truly remarkable film.", "THE MAN WHO LAUGHS starts exceptionally well and definitely gets your attention. In many ways, it seems reminiscent of a Rafael Sabatini novel--the same guy who brought many adventure tales to the screen (such as CAPTAIN BLOOD, SCARAMOUCHE and THE BLACK SWAN), though the actual story was by Victor Hugo. King James II of England (a particularly bad king according to most history books) has arranged for the death of an enemy in a very brutal scene. And, in a nasty move, he has the face of his enemy's young son, Gwynplaine, carved into a permanent smile by some bizarre group of evil gypsies. However, the boy does survive and makes his way in the snow to the wagon of a nice gypsy (the non-face carving kind) and on the way he discovers a baby (Dea) in the arms of a dead woman.Years pass and now Gwynplaine is a famous adult--famous for his stage act along with his adopted gypsy dad and the grown baby--now a gorgeous but blind lady (Mary Philbin). It's pretty obvious Gwynplaine and Dea are in love but fate steps in when a current monarch, Anne, finds out that Gwynplaine is the heir to a title. He is kidnapped and instated as a peer in the House of Lords--though it doesn't go well for Gwynplaine. He'd much rather have his old life and Dea. Tune in for yourself to find out what happens.In many ways, this film is the pinnacle of silent films in America. It debuted very late in 1928 and had it been made just a few months later, it would likely have been a sound film (though how they could have done this with the facial appliance Conrad Veidt had to wear for the title role would have been a problem). But, as it was made in this transition period, Universal added a soundtrack along with sound effects and a song--making it a semi-talkie. Additionally, the cinematography is just lovely and the story very engaging. One of the better silent films and one that has somehow been almost forgotten over the years.By the way, the DVD from Kino is exceptional. Not only is the print nearly pristine but there are lots of extras on the DVD that would make this a nice addition to any home library.", "Saturday July 12, 7:45pm, The Castro Theater, San FranciscoAt the moment of his execution, a rebellious nobleman learns that his child has been mutilated by gypsies. Taken in by a travelling, self-appointed philosopher, the boy becomes a popular carnival attraction. The grotesque Man Who Laughs, Gwynplaine (Conrad Veidt) worships Dea (Mary Philbin), a beautiful blind girl he rescued as an infant, until he is used by the Queen to usurp a Duchess who is undeserving of her title.Producer Carl Laemmle sought to exploit the Gothic horror craze Universal Pictures established with The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and The Phantom of The Opera (1925), once again adapting a romantic and darkly sinister Victor Hugo novel. Sensational production values and art direction, the result of an immense budget, are quite apparent. The use of principals drawn from Weimar Cinema, on both sides of the camera, gave The Man Who Laughs an unmistakable quality that significantly influenced the genre.", "I saw this last night at the New Orleans Film Fest and was blown away.  The film has been restored and was shown with a live octet to boot.  The story was complex yet easy to understand and the acting was great.  I was amazed at some of the camera work and film editing for such an early period in film history.  It is too bad Leni died so young because he was headed for greatness.", "This takes place in 17th century England. A young noble mans son Gwynplaine (played as an adult by Conrad Veidt) is kidnapped by a political enemy. He then has a surgeon carve a monstrous grin on the boys face. Years later he's part of a freak show and in love with a beautiful blind girl (Mary Philbin). However his political personage becomes known and causes trouble.This is usually advertised as a horror film due to Veidt's hideous grin but it's not. It's a slow-moving and frankly boring historical drama. Universal spend a lot of money on this and it shows. The sets and costumes are very elaborate and it IS well-directed by Paul Leni. Also Veidt is great in his role. He had to convey all his emotions through his eyes and pulls it off. However I was bored silly and had my finger of the fast forward button more than once. Also Mary Philbin was terrible as the blind girl. Boring and uninvolving.", "Seriously, I was expecting a horror or creepy mystery film like \"Caligari\". And in the beginning, it feels strange and weird like a nightmare. The scene in the snow with the corpses hanging from from the gallows is pure apocalyptic nightmare fuel.But from the moment we see Conrad Veidt in full make-up and smiling himself into the hearts of two women, it becomes something else entirely. It's funny, a bit sad but alltogether a pretty simple love story.Not a bad film for sure! What Veidt did to his face is scarier than all of the scenes together. I just expected something else.", "Finally after all these years just watched the 1928 classic \"The Man Who Laughs\" call it horror, suspense, drama, black comedy anyway it's an interesting film on many levels with themes of love, hate, loss, and hope. Plus the score and shadows and faces of odd characters move the film along so well. The expressions and odd places, of people and houses closely rub with the era of German cinema, as it plays with the mind and imagination of dark against light.Based on a novel from 1869 from Victor Hugo it tells the tale of a noble who would not kiss up or obey King James II therefore his son is taken away and for punishment has a surgically disfigured smile like grin carved across his face! That man is Gwynplaine(Conrad Veidt) who later with his difference and odd face becomes a sideshow freak show performer. This and his meeting of a blind girl named Dea is his only cure for being lonely as only she can feel his gentle nature. This picture is full of doubt and tension from love and difference really for it's day and time so good on many levels.And if you know movie history and pop culture stories you know that this picture helped inspire D.C. comics for the ideal of the \"Clown Prince of Crime\" the one and only \"Joker\" as the grin and smile were to good to turn away for a creation. Overall well done silent film that's important and historical.", "THE MAN WHO LAUGHS (1928) is the tale of Gwynplaine (Conrad Veidt), who was disfigured as a boy as retaliation for his father's refusal to pay obeisance to King James II. With a blind foundling, Dea (Mary Philbin), he grows up to become a traveling performer. Gwynplaine is involved in court intrigue when an evil jester discovers his existence and plots an arranged marriage to control Gwynplaine's fortune as the heir to a lord. Directed by Paul Leni.THE MAN WHO LAUGHS movingly portrays Gwynplaine's plight as a man who is marginalized by society. His disfigurement controls his life in many ways. Crowds laugh at Gwynplaine for his appearance, and he feels that no woman can love him because of his face (except for the blind Dea). The script touchingly conveys the love between Gwyplaine and Dea, who only sees the inner man. However, I felt that the exposition lacked clarity when the story dealt with Barkilphedro the jester's intrigue and the reasons for the arranged marriage. Was the jester planning to kill Gwynplaine and take the money as his own? His motivations are not fully clarified, except for the fact that he is evil. On the other hand, maybe it was a plan to rectify things for Gwynplaine. I wasn't sure. The narrative drags a bit in places but comes to a pretty epic and satisfying conclusion.As far as the performances go, Conrad Veidt is compelling as Gwynplaine, haunting and expressive even though required to hold his face in the contorted laugh to which the title alludes. Veidt is compelling, emotive and unforgettable in his role. For much of her role Mary Philbin doesn't get to do much other than smile and look pretty, but she does realistically portray a blind woman, a definite acting challenge. She does best in her scenes with Veidt. Olga Baclanova is very charismatic as Duchess Josiana, alluring, flirtatious and imperious. Cesare Gravina, who plays Ursus, the philosopher who takes Gwynplaine in, overacts in the Grand Guignol style, something that would be practically obliterated from film about two years later when the switchover to talking film was finally complete.The production is moody and evocative in the German Expressionist style, using light and shadow, as well as camera angles, to heighten the feeling of the film. I was able to watch the original version with a synchronized sound track. The music was appropriately vivid, and sound effects were added liberally to the score \u2013 especially crowd noise and clanging objects at the fair. This can be rather jarring at times, since these effects often play alongside the music, even during love scenes! However, it is an interesting artifact of the pre-talkie era, as Hollywood was learning how to incorporate recorded music into movies.Overall, the story was moving when it came to Gwyplaine's plight, although somewhat muddy when dealing with the intrigue. Conrad Veidt and Olga Baclanova give compelling performances, with good support from Mary Philbin, and the style of the movie is quite intriguing. A fine movie from the late silent era. SCORE: 8/10", "Holy Caesar Romero, it is over 90 years later and the legacy of the lead in this film has never been bigger. Portrayed by the greatest villain in 20th century film, Conrad Veidt, The Man who Laughs is a unique horror house ride where unlike Frankenstein's monster, the disfigured protagonist, innocent of any wrong doing has a heart and soul.King James has decided to toss all the gypsies from the shores of England back to Europe. Forever outcasts they resorted to disfiguring children to make for better beggars. A child, Gwyndalaine, an actual heir to the throne given to the gypsies who carve a smile into his face is left behind. Plucking a child from a mother's dead arms he trudges through a blizzard before being taken in by a promotor who raises both, the baby girl, blind and the kid with the mile wide smile who grows into a theatrical sensation. Problems continue to plague however.Unable to change expressions, his eyes doing most of the work Veidt's responses in certain situations are jarring as he powerfully plays out the irony of his self mocking exterior while dying inside. Ably assisting in creating his personal hell society pays to roar at his deformity while royalty conspires against him. Only Dea, the blind girl played by a beatific Mary Philbin and his manager, played wildly over the top by Ceasre Gravina remain in Gwyn's corner. Seductress Countess Josiana (Olga Baclanova) on the other hand in a moment of weakness falls for him in a depraved way.Director Paul Leni maintains a fascinating dark mood and look throughout the film with Gwynplaine, our tragic guide suffering from one brutal situation to the next without let-up. I'm not surprised all subsequent Jokers throughout comic, TV and film history have been trying to even things up. A disturbing film with an exciting finish.", "A meditation on the disfiguring effects of low self-esteem.Conrad Veidt is moving as Gwynplaine, deliberately mutilated in youth and forever relegated to the role of sideshow clown. Also interesting is Josiana (Olga Baclanova - later to appear in 1932's \"Freaks\"), a lascivious duchess who toys with the tortured performer.Still, I found the movie to drag a bit in parts. Beautiful as she is, Mary Philbin's Dea lacks depth. And we never discover for ourselves exactly what makes Gwynplaine such a hit at the Southwark fairgrounds. The film would have benefited from tighter editing.I did like this movie for an opportunity to look up the life of author Victor Hugo, whose daughter inspired the much later film, \"The Story of Adele H,\" which I highly recommend.", "The Man Who Laughs is a movie adaptation of a Victor Hugo novel. It is the story of Gmynplaine, the son of a disgraced noblemen who is facially mutilated by gypsies. He has a permanent smile (definitely a family resemblance to Jack Nicolson's Joker... except without the criminal and deranged aspect). German Expressionist actor, Conrad Veidt plays the lead role. His performance is exceptional, especially when one realizes that the smile-face prosthesis prevented him from talking (Universal had played with the idea to make this movie a talkie at first). The theme is a combination of love and personal tragedy. The story revolves mostly around those 2 themes. The set pieces are dark and grim, but feel \"real\". The close ups are typical of the silent movie era, however, the event scenes are not. Such scenes as the Iron Lady torture scene and the performance of the play set this movie apart from others of the time. The smile itself is the most poignant aspect conveying comedy, sadness and at times creepiness. There are some unintentional comical aspects. For example, Homo the dog. It makes lines like \"Homo, where are you taking me?\", into a chuckle opportunity . There is also the line towards the end where our hero calls out for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). All in all this is a classic movie. This movie is not recommended for today's movie audience, as the silent movie aspect will probably put most into a popcorn/soda coma. For those that appreciate the silent movie, I highly recommend it."], "tt0019456": ["\"The Terror\", one of the very first all-talking pictures, was released without a film soundtrack. The dialogue and sound effects were recorded on a separate Vitaphone disc (a large 33.3rpm phonograph record). The cinema projectionist was supposed to start playing the record and the first reel of the (silent) film at the same time, hoping that the sound and the image stayed in synch through the successive reels.I saw this movie in difficult circumstances. In the 1980s, I tracked down a copy of the Vitaphone disc (the sound without the images) in a film archive, and I was able to play back the disc with no expectation of ever seeing the> movie itself. About twenty years later, I located an incomplete nitrate print of the film (the images without the sound) in the possession of a private collector, who permitted me to screen it on a hand-cranked Movieola. So, I heard this film about 20 years before I saw it. Fortunately, I took notes when I audited the sound disc (and I'm familiar with the source material), so I've got a halfway-decent idea of how the sounds and the images would go together. Also, I've seen the 1938 remake, filmed in England... which is, frankly, a much better movie than this version.\"The Terror\" was originally a stage play by the prolific English author Edgar Wallace. It's a spooky-old-house thriller, of the sort that was so popular in the 1920s. (\"The Bat\", \"The Cat and the Canary\", \"The Gorilla\", \"The Last Warning\", etc.) This Hollywood version retains the British references of the original play, but (confusingly) features a primarily American cast, most of whom make no attempt to impersonate English characters.The Terror is a mysterious criminal who has committed many murders and thefts, always escaping: his true identity is unknown. Rumour has it that the Terror has been skulking in the vicinity of an old house, currently tenanted by Doctor Redmayne. As so often happens in this sort of play, Redmayne has summoned a motley collection of guests. Among them are Mrs Elvery (a self-described psychic) and Ferdy Fayne, an accident-prone simpleton. Also present are Joe and Soapy, a couple of convicts temporarily released from prison to help trap the Terror ... and Superintendent Hallick of Scotland Yard, who's here to keep an eye on Joe and Soapy. Obviously, SOMEONE present is the Terror in disguise ... ah, but who?The actors who play the two criminals (Matthew Betz and Otto Hoffman) are excellent, although Hoffman has a suspiciously stage-trained voice for a guy who's playing a career criminal. Handsome John Miljan is good in a small role. SPOILERS COMING. Edward Everett Horton, as Ferdy Fayne, is excellent in a role that departs significantly from Horton's usual nervous-nelly routine. Fayne is rather dim-witted, until late in the film when Horton reveals that he's actually a detective working undercover to catch the Terror. At this point, a total change comes over Edward Everett Horton, and he suddenly becomes resolute and intelligent. I wish that Horton's long film career had given him more opportunities to play forthright roles like this.The worst performance is given by the film's leading lady, May McAvoy, a silent-film ingenue whose voice was too weak for talkies. McAvoy swallows her words, mumbles, stammers, and lisps. She's very pretty, but her voice is terrible. As the damsel in distress, McAvoy has to scream several times in this film: the camera always cuts away from her at these moments, and the full-throated screams which result are clearly supplied by some other actress serving as a voice-double: the screams are much louder and clearer than any of the dialogue that McAvoy speaks in this film. There are some very unconvincing sound effects at inopportune moments.To make this film \"officially\" a talkie, the credits are spoken by Conrad Nagel, appearing on screen in an opera cape and domino mask. Roy Del Ruth is an underrated director, but his work here is below his usual standard, probably due to the technical requirements: the camera barely moves, and there are long sequences without a cut.\"The Terror\" is a stagebound story that should have remained on the stage. This film is interesting as a creaky curiosity, but its entertainment value is negligible. I'll rate it 2 points out of 10.", "... as well as the second all talking feature film ever made, and yet it is lost. The first all talking feature film was \"Lights of New York\" released in July 1928, and it still survives. Warner Brothers, which pioneered talking films, had a pretty disposable attitude towards their early talking films.The film is based on a mystery play written in 1927 by Edgar Wallace. The play had more details. Three men pulled off a big heist, but then the master mind betrayed his two henchmen to the police and made off with the gold. Neither mastermind nor treasure were ever heard from again. Years later, the haunting of a rented house begins.The movie picks up at this point with guests at the house being scared by strange noises in the night and mysterious organ music. And soon an unseen force begins murdering people. Guests include a spiritualist and a Scotland Yard detective played by Edward Everett Horton, if you can believe such casting. This was one of May McAvoy 's rare leading roles in a sound film. Conrad Nagel appears to speak the credits just so Warner 's could claim the film was truly \"all talking\".The film made good money, bringing in 1.2 million dollars in North America and another 250K worldwide, seventh for the year. Reviews were not so good, however. London critics panned it badly as being slow, creaky, and even boring. Author Edgar Wallace himself said - \" \"I have never thought the talkies would be a serious rival to the stage.\"Warner Bros. Records for the film 's negative indicate that it was intentionally destroyed in December 1948, probably due to nitrate decomposition. Warner Brothers never saw much value in their very early sound films and destroyed many of them, figuring they 'd never be of interest to anybody. In spite of this, five reels survive in France. The Vitaphone sound discs survive at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.This film has been particularly elusive as far as tracking down any associated elements. Many of the sound discs of lost Warner Brothers films are available for listening at the internet archive, but this one is not. A kind of sequel to this film was made in 1934 by Warner Brothers, but it too survives only in an archive. It has never played on Turner Classic Movies. The same is true of the British remake made in 1938.", "The camera's restrictive movements were due to it being in a booth to suppress the loud noises it made. 2022's \"Downton Abbey: A New Era\" illustrates the accuracy of the time period & actual usage of cameras making such initial talkies. Being the 2nd all talkie film ( after the original \"Lights of New York\" ) The full length of this film has been lost through time."], "tt0020078": ["Universal was enamored of setting stories in the theater, weren't they? Perhaps \"Phantom of the Opera\" set the precedence. \"The Last Warning\" featured a masked murderer terrorizing Broadway. \"The Last Performance\" sets a love triangle among a magic act. Once again, Mary Philbin plays the object of desire of a murderous older man. While \"Phantom\" had obvious grotesque attributes and \"The Last Warning\" was basically an old dark house mystery, \"The Last Performance\" is a melodrama with light fantastic elements.The story is typical. Erik the Great, a stage magician and hypnotist, is in love with Julie, his female assistant. He plans to marry the girl as soon as she turns eighteen, a story turn likely to gross out modern audiences. Julie only has eyes for Mark, a vagabond that Erik takes under his wing. \"The Last Performance\" neatly follows the three-act structure, with Erik discovering the truth about his love at the 18 minute point, the \"seven swords through the box\" magic trick going predictably wrong half-way through, and the last act set during a trial, with the case-solving testimony serving as a concise climax.Of most interest to horror fans is Conrad Veidt's performance. Veidt was made for the silents. He says so much with simply a shift of his brow, expressing heart-break or jealousy with only his face. Despite the temptation to compare the two, Erik the Great isn't Erik the Phantom. He's not a monster, rather a fair man who commits wrong only out of love. The hypnotism sequences make great use of his glaring eyes. No wonder Veidt was nearly Dracula. Conrad's performance alone makes the sappy finale believable. The rest of the cast is thin, with Mary Philbin making goo-goo eyes at Fred MacKaye, a marginal matin\u00e9e hero.While lighter on expressionistic atmosphere then you'd hope, \"The Last Performance\" still has several stand-out moments. An early bit has Veidt walking a catwalk, shadows criss-crossing over his face. When the lover's affair is revealed, his shadow is cast huge on the wall, dwarfing the girl and her mate. Veidt's power as a hypnotist is displayed by overlaying his glaring face over the character performing the requested action. A memorable early scene has the man mesmerizing a skeptical audience member, their theater booth suddenly spinning around them.\"The Last Performance\" is another example of routine silent film material elevated by its lead actor. After years of obscurity, the film was recently released by the Criterion Collection\u0085 Kind of. It's a special feature packaged with \"Lonesome,\" a later film by the same director. This version has Danish titles with English subtitles and is apparently missing several sound sequences. The film is concise enough that I can't imagine those scenes would add much.", "Conrad Veidt is a stage magician with two assistants. One is Leslie Fenton. The other is Mary Philbin, with whom Veidt is in love. One evening, Fred MacKaye breaks into Veidt's hotel room and is caught.... hungrily eating Veidt's dinner. Veidt takes him on as a third assistant. Then he catches MacKaye and Miss Philbin canoodling; he olympically wishes them well, but one evening, doing the trick where Fenton is placed in a trunk and MacKaye shoves swords into the trunk, something goes wrong, and Fenton is discovered in the trunk, stabbed to death. MacKaye is arrested.Veidt offers one of his great performances; the blacking he wears around his eyes to make him look devilish makes me wonder how he would have been playing Dracula in Tod Browning's version of the movie. In many ways, this looks likes a variation on the sort of formulaic movie that Lon Chaney was starring in at MGM at the moment... although Veidt's performance never asks for our sympathy. He simply dominates everyone.", "Often termed a horror film (due to it's background of stage magic) this is really a tale of thwarted love. Conrad Veidt excels as the kindly Erik the Great who finds his soon to be bride has fallen in love with one of his assistants. The discovery scene is a superb piece of acting from Veidt, as he shifts from shock to heartbreak, struggling to be magnanimous, and then gradually to cold calculation with the subtlest changes of expression.These moments and a dynamic trial scene elevate what is otherwise an okay backstage melodrama into a truly compelling tale of jealousy and redemption. Palo Fejos, director of the wonderful \"Lonesome\", injects some stylish visuals.The version I've seen is a truncated and mute print of 48 minutes, so I may have missed some of the film's finer points.", "Famed magician, hypnotist Erik the Great (Conrad Veidt) has a Svengali issue with his comely underage assistant Julie (Mary Philbin). Awaiting the day for her to turn 18 he stage manages an over the top dinner party to announce their engagement. Unfortunately due to his charitable ways he takes on a second story man as an assistant who Julie falls for much to the delight of Erik's other bitter assistant.A last gasp (1929) silent featuring some outstanding set design, tracking shots and the magnetic mugs of Veidt and Philbin, The Last Performance allows itself little time to build (barely an hour) with the young lovers clicking in no time with little development. The incredibly graceful and intimidating Veidt with his hands and eyes is always a fascinating watch especially when he has to do a painful 180 at the engagement soiree. The bottom falls out in the second half though with a revenge plot playing out tediously and a Perry Mason like finale for the ages. The Last Performance is a poor one.", "It is a part of the recent Criterion collection of Paul Fejos film.

It is really the work of a virtuoso working at his peak. It has everything The Cat and the Canary had and more. The version that seems to be relatively available on video has a good music track too, but unfortunately it seems that the experimental sound sequences the film originally contained have not survived.Nevertheless, we are lucky that this film has survived as it is such a joyous romp of horror cliches with inventive, wild camera moves and stunning lighting and spooky set design. It foreshadows the great horror classics that were less than two years away for Universal. It is just wonderful filmmaking from a forgotten great director who was at his peak, so if you are into old dark house mysteries or Universal horror movies - FIND IT! - It is one of the best!8/10 - even better than The Cat and the Canary.", "Last Warning, The (1929)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Paul Leni (The Cat and the Canary, The Man Who Laughs) directs this Universal horror film, which has been forgotten over the years but if you've seen some of the studios bigger pictures then you've can tell what all this film has influenced. A popular show on Broadway, inside a creepy theatre, is closed down after the mysterious murder of one of the actors. Years later the police reassemble the original cast and bring them back to the theater to see if they can trap the murderer but it might be a ghost they're dealing with. This film mixes elements of The Phantom of the Opera with the old dark house themes of films like The Bat and delivers a terrific entertainment. This film has never been officially released so I had to view it via what appears to be a 16mm print and the quality was pretty bad throughout so if I get a chance to see a pristine print then I'll probably bump my review up. The technical eye of Leni, who died after this film, is untouched by nearly everyone as he's constantly trying new and different things with the camera. I love how he'll have a medium shot and then move the camera in to show some evidence before moving it back out to let the action role. The film runs just under 80-minutes and goes by very fast with some exciting action but also a great story to work with. The actors, including John Boles who would later appear in Frankenstein, all do nice work as well. There are a few twists and turns along the way that actually work well within the story. This film works on a technical level as well as the story level and that makes this a wonderful little gem that needs to be rediscovered. The only thing people know about this movie nowdays is that it was a huge influence on James Whale and this is easy to see. There's a woman here, used as comic relief, which is later a carbon copy in Una O'Connor. The Old Dark House also lifts some shots here but I won't say which ones since it'll ruin scenes in both movies. The score here was also later reused in Dracula and this film was shot on the same sets as The Phantom of the Opera so there's a lot of connections here.", "Essentially this is part \"Cat and the Canary\" and part \"Phantom of the Opera\" - also silent Universal properties. It has some slack parts but the visual atmosphere helps to cover them up, and it has some very inventive title cards where the writing may be initially blurry and come into focus, or the writing may start up clear and then appear to melt down the page, or it may appear to be underwater.The film is about an actor, John Woodford, in a theatre on Broadway, who dies suddenly when he gets to the part of the play where he is backed into the fireplace by another actor and picks up a candlestick. The lights go out, and when they come back on there is Woodford dead on the floor. The police come to question everybody who was present, then Woodford's body disappears before the coroner gets there. It is discovered by the police that Woodford and another actor, Richard Quayle (John Boles) were arguing in actress Doris Terry's (Laura LaPlante's) dressing room, and both were suitors of hers.So without a body, the investigation cannot go on, the theatre is closed, and the papers are shown having a field day with the \"love triangle\" that is insinuated to have something to do with the killing. Several years later, Woodford's close friend (Montagu Love as Arthur McHugh) decides to reopen the theatre with the same cast as the night of the killing and the same play. Why does the entire cast return? Because to not return would make them look guilty.But somebody does not want the play to open. Heavy scenery comes crashing down. Smoke bombs go off. Threatening letters are written to members of the cast that they perform at their peril, and some mysterious masked figure is running and jumping about the place and even stealing Doris' purse and putting her personal possessions in strategic places to make her look like she is in on all of the strange happenings. Is it the ghost of John Woodford trying to avenge himself? Well of course not. But it might be the real John Woodford, having faked his own death, and still mad at Boles and LaPlante for his romantic rejection. Watch and find out what is behind all of this.The visuals are just great here. The opening scene reminds me somewhat of 1929's Broadway with all of the pictures of the Broadway nightlife of 1929. Also, the theatre, from the outside, looks like the face of some frightening creature complete with eyes, a nose, and mouth. I just wish better prints were available.", "\"Broadway - electric highway of happiness\" and instantly you are treated to a golden (my copy was tinted) visual treat, a montage of high stepping chorus girls, glittering lights showing the Strand and Madison Square Garden that soon turn to police lights and sirens - there has been a murder committed at the Woodford Theatre!! Paul Leni and his cameraman Hal Mohr find some fantastic camera angles (Margaret Livingston is first glimpsed, from a camera positioned on the floor, stepping over a spider's web). Like \"The Cat and the Canary\" spider's webs feature prominently in the second half. Much of the film is set in an old theatre that was originally constructed for the Paris Opera sequences in \"The Phantom of the Opera\"(1925).The leading actor John Woodford has fallen dead on stage while clutching a candlestick and even though chloroform has been discovered dripping on stage it is still too baffling for the police to solve, especially as the body disappears!! There is another fabulous montage of newspaper headlines showing the police are baffled and the leading lady Doris Terry (Laura La Plante) and stage director Richard Quayle (a very young John Boles) once lovebirds, have now separated due to doubts and anxiety.Suddenly the theatre, after years of gloom, is due to open again with sunlight streaming through the musty windows and cobwebs filling the screen. And even though new owner, Arthur McHugh (Montague Love) has had an ominous warning from the ghostly John Woodford, he is determined to forge ahead by staging the last play presented, along with the original cast members. But is he who he claims to be? It is Montague Love after all, a master villain of the silent screen!! Another message \"Beware, let the dead sleep\" is ignored and Harvey Carleton (Roy D'Arcy) is given Woodford's old part and is thrilled - until he receives a ghostly calling card!!From then on hijinks abound - suspended scenery crashes onto the stage, a fire starts when all the cast are closeted in a dressing room, the chair on the stage disappears. La Plante must have felt a \"Cat and the Canary\" type deja vu, with wizened hands emerging from wall panels etc but really, after a while, the film takes on a \"Phantom of the Opera\" persona as a flitting figure climbs balconies, shimmies ropes and strides up rickety stairs, having a first hand knowledge of the ins and outs of the musty old theatre. Helped enormously by Leni's masterful direction and Hal Mohr's fluid camera-work. At times the camera seems attached to the rope as he swings from balcony to landing with hands grappling at the camera as he just evades their capture.An all star cast helped with La Plante perfecting her hand to mouth, stricken face and screaming stance. John Boles suitably wooden (was he any other way) and Margaret Livingston at her vampish best. Love the end title \"It's a Universal Picture, how did you like it? Write to me with your opinion\"!! Just too cute!!", "Astute producer Carl Laemmle invited talented German director Paul Leni to join Universal. This proved to be a masterstroke. Before his untimely death in 1929 Leni directed four films one of which, 'The Chinese Parrot' is considered 'lost', the other three of which are superb. From its astonishing opening sequence 'The Last Warning' is a brilliantly inventive and imaginative piece that holds our attention throughout. A great deal of credit must surely go to cinematographer Hal Mohr who, although American born, had assimilated European film techniques during a brief sojourn in Paris. His greatest achievement is the 'Midsummer Night's Dream' of Max Reinhardt. The specially composed score although a little over-orchestrated, is far superior to the usual incongruous, excruciating, tacked on scores with which so many restored silent films are cursed. Such a sadness to lose a director of Leni's gifts but his influence on Universal's classic horrors of the 1930's is there for all to see.", "\"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927) must've been a popular entry in what was already a crowded field of old-dark-house horror comedies in the final years of the silent era. One need look no further for evidence of that fact than this followup film, \"The Last Warning,\" which reunited director Paul Leni and star Laura Le Plante, as well as a couple of the same writers and art director, for a similar spooky murder mystery with the slight novelty that it's set in a theatre this time. Moreover, the next year, following Leni's death, Universal released a talkie remake of \"The Cat and the Canary,\" the now-lost \"The Cat Creeps\" (1930). (Likewise, \"The Last Warning\" was later remade as \"The House of Fear\" (1939), which is the title of the book from which the play and, thus, the films were derived.) Although Leni's two films were based on different plays, it seems that many of these narratives tended to be strikingly similar, with perhaps the stage version of \"The Bat\" being the originator of the formula, which itself was made twice for the screen by Roland West (\"The Bat\" (1926) and \"The Bat Whispers\" (1930)). The other successful Universal property that \"The Last Warning\" clearly borrows from is \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925) by reusing its auditorium set, and like Gaston Leroux's story, the stage setting of \"The Last Warning\" features a play-within-a-play structure--offering a self-reflexive twist on the familiar old-dark-house formula.Personally, although I've been reviewing quite a few of these films lately, I'm not a fan of the formula--at least not until James Whale introduced a more campy sense of humor and more twisted subject matter with \"The Old Dark House\" (1932). Before that, they tended to be exceedingly silly, relying on characters' fear of ghosts, and the mysteries are hardly interesting, if not appallingly convoluted. That of \"The Last Warning\" is especially of little concern, with nary a clue offered throughout the proceedings before an intricate resolution clumsily ties everything together in the end. The main point of the construction, though, was to replay the antics of the 1927 film. So, once again, there's a whodunit, the body of which disappears, and a group of suspects are brought together under one roof, where they're excessively scared that a ghost is behind all of the horrors. As in \"The Bat\" and \"The Cat and the Canary,\" there's a masked menace creeping through hidden passages haunting the place. By employing \"The Phantom of the Opera\" set, the similarity between these haunted house plays to Leroux's story becomes blatant, as well, with both featuring a masked menace terrorizing its occupants. Unlike Leroux's Phantom, however, this one has no Christine, but rather insists that no play be performed at all.Like \"The Cat and the Canary,\" Leni's style here goes a long way in at least making them visually appealing. The superimpositions, including kaleidoscopic images, the moving title effects and moving-camera shots stand out. Originally, there were also sound effects and dialogue scenes, making this late silent film a goat gland and offering the additional technical marvelry of sound. More interesting, though, and why I like this a bit more than \"The Cat and the Canary\" and most of the other early old dark houses is the honesty of the self-reference of how shamelessly this film imitates its predecessors. In it, the same cast and crew are brought back together to perform the same play they performed years ago, when the original murder occurred, and this is essentially what Leni and the rest of the Universal staff were doing in making the film--bringing back the same cast and crew to perform basically the same play they performed years ago. Even where the cast isn't exactly the same in the two films, the different actors mimic some of the same types of the prior one--so much so that I initially thought that at least a couple others besides Le Plante had appeared in \"The Cat and the Canary\" as well. Appropriately, the play-within-the-play is titled \"The Snare,\" the play itself being a snare to uncover the murderer in the narrative. In fact, the most we ever get of the inner play is from the point-of-views of the producer and stage hands as spectators of the culprit being lured in by their ruse, and not of the actual play performed for the theatre audience, whose perspectives we don't share. But, the real snare is the trap set by the filmmakers to lure audiences back for the same film in a new guise.(Note: The reduction prints out there for home viewing are horrendous, but there is a restored version that has appeared at festivals. Hopefully, it'll receive a home video release someday like its companion piece, \"The Cat and the Canary.\")", "\"The Last Warning\" (1928) was Paul Leni's last film as director before his untimely death from sepsis at the age of 44. Starring Laura La Plante, Montague Love, John Boles, Margaret Livingston, Roy D'Arcy, and a host of other pre-eminent silent film actors of the day, this film continues in the vein of \"The Cat and the Canary\" (1927), another Leni film starring Laura La Plante. Based on a successful 1922 play, the film opens on a stage play where John Woodford (D'Arcy Corrigan) is on stage reaching for a candle, but dies as the mechanical candle electrocutes Woodford. Now, the play is halted, police called in, and, after a series of several hectic and quickly moved-through scenes, the body disappears, never to be seen again. Five years later, a \"producer\", Montague Love, decides to re-open the theater - which had been closed in the interim - and re-stage the same play Woodford had been killed performing in, and now have the same cast perform the play for the re-opening of the theater. Roy D'Arcy will replace Woodford in that part and John Boles will replace D'Arcy in his old part. Well, D'Arcy is nearly electrocuted during a rehearsal; then seemingly disappears! Boles replaces D'Arcy, and the play opens that night! Near the scene where the candle is to be reached for and grabbed, the police - a group of at least 10 and perhaps a couple of unsuspected persons who might be the police - are ready for anything.The photography; that is, the movement of the camera, what it captures and how, is how Leni made his reputation. He'd done remarkable things with films like \"Hintertreppe\" (1921), \"Waxworks\" (1924) and \"The Man Who Laughs\" (1928). Hal Mohr was Leni's cinematographer on this shoot, and the fluidity and creative shooting is what makes this film a cinematic masterpiece. The story is rather \"old dark house\", and it's fun, with comic touches and dramatic incident, but it's the deft direction and smart editing, along with a cast of pros, that makes this film something to enjoy and wish to come back to in the future.There were a few sound scenes added to the original release that are no longer extant. The restored version is quite good, though a few scratches here and there, especially near the beginning and end, are evident. My print is the European restored one from Eureka Masters of Cinema. I needed to re-set my Blu-Ray to Region 2 to play it. It didn't do it automatically.The opening and closing scenes have been described as 'kaleidoscopic', and that is a perfect description. Wonderful cinematography and editing throughout make this a wonderful experience over 90 years after release! Highly recommended. Among others in the remarkable cast are Burr McIntosh, Bert Roach, Mack Swain, Slim Summerville, and Carrie Daumery.", "Well silent movies tend to move slow but there are exceptions. We have Midnight Faces, The Bat, The Cat and The Canary and also this movie. Midnight Faces is just a chaotic mess. The Bat and The Cat and The Canary have the right pace, alternating between slow and fast sequences but still giving enough attention to introducing each character and giving them some kind of personality. The latter is a bit the problem with The Last Warning. It has plenty of atmosphere and the theatre is a great setting to have this murder mystery picture. However characters are barely given introduction or much depth. So often I was wondering OK who is who again. The director obviously went for visuals and action instead of a strong plot and proper character development. Still I think it's worth a re-watch.", "I didn't enjoy this anything like as much as the wonderful The Man Who Laughs but then this is variation on the haunted house story and whilst novel enough at the time (more than 90 years ago!) not so interesting now. Also, at the time, it seemed still necessary to have a little bit of light relief every now and again and this can grate. On the positive side the opening and closing with kaleidoscopic and superimposed imagery is fantastic but does tend to make you wish there was a little more as we cut to a rather dreary stage stage-bound, repetitive and slow moving melodrama .", "Another idiot plot, similar to that of \"London after Midnight\": An actor is killed on stage. The theatre is shut down and rumored to be haunted by the actor's ghost. Long after the murder, a policeman with 'way too much time on his hands reopens the theatre to restage the production with the original cast (uh, with a new leading man). A couple of people refuse to go along but are scared that if they don't, it will make them look guilty. (Huh?) Someone terrifies the actors in ways that would terrify nobody, e.g. by leaving notes like \"Do not do this play--Signed, my ghost.\" A mysterious figure skulks around in a creepy mask. The policeman's plan in re-creating the production is to bring the murderer to light; what he has in mind is unclear, but luckily for him the murderer obligingly duplicates the crime--like there's a rule he has to. His motive and means seemed unlikely to me, but who knows with these theatre people?In short, a silly, silly plot. But Leni directs it very deftly. I'm not a fan of his \"Cat and the Canary,\" despite some inventive shots: the lead is unfunny, the tone keeps varying, and the play (none too great to start with) is fragmented. The movie looks to me as if it had undergone much re-editing. By contrast, this and \"The Man Who Laughs\" are just as inventive but much more sure-handed. Of course \"The Man Who Laughs\" is serious and this one isn't, but it's visually lively all the way through and the actors are well used. Montague Love is as good as always and John Boles gives the leading man more depth than he probably deserves. Laura la Plante's wide-eyed close-ups remind me somewhat of Fatty Arbuckle's, but Leni may have had his tongue in his cheek there.Now, if someone will resurrect \"The Chinese Parrot\"....", "I don't have too much to say about \"The Last Warning.\" It's not much of a horror film. There's certainly some horrific elements floating around. The story revolves around an actor dying mysteriously on-stage during a theatrical performance. Years later, a man reopens the theater and decides to restage that play, in hopes of luring out the murderer. This plan is wildly successful.Sometimes, the only difference between a murder mystery and a horror film is the delivery. \"The Last Warning\" is focused on sleuthing. A large portion of this short film is devoted to sneaking around the theater, investigating things. There's plenty of cobwebs, reported ghost sightings, creepy old prop dummies, and a killer in a weird mask with monster claws on. However, all of these things make up a small portion of the film.Because of the lousy condition of my copy, the inappropriate musical score, and the silent format, I had trouble sousing out the individual details. The man responsible for the investigation seems to give a good performance. An old man who constantly yells at a stage hand for dancing or singing is funny. But other details, such as who exactly everyone is and the obligatory love story, got lost among the static.This was the second teaming of director Paul Leni and star Laura La Plante, after \"The Cat and the Canary.\" Leni's visual sense continues to be strong. An opening montage establishes the Broadway spirit in a surreal, interesting way. Shots, like a grasping hand appearing over the action, a wounded man stumbling out of the shadows of a secret passageway, or a bump appearing in the carpet from under the floor, are nice touches. La Plante has even less to do here as she isn't involved much in the action. The film's Broadway setting made me think Universal was hoping for a cheaper \"Phantom of the Opera.\" The climatic sequence, involving the cops chasing a murderous man in a creepy mask across the theater, certainly recalls that film. Perhaps not coincidentally, it's also the best moment in the movie. Generally speaking though, I don't think \"The Last Warning\" has much to offer horror fans, classic or otherwise.", "THE STORY & (Pseudo)GENRE -- PHANTOM OF THE OPERA meets CAT AND THE CANARY (also by director Leni). Bizarre visuals liven up the nonsense.THE VERDICT -- Fast-paced even at 78 minutes. Plenty of old-time thrills and smiles.FREE ONLINE -- Yes. The ubiquitous orange-tinted print (77 minutes), but also the newer BD upgrade (78 minutes), can be found. Silent with music and effects. I have never seen an 89-minute version, as advertised by IMDB.", "\"The Last Warning\" gave master director Paul Leni ample oportunity to pull from his seemingly unending bag of eye-popping visual tricks. Although this theatrical murder mystery does not quite hit the astonishing highs of \"The Cat and the Canary\", the sheer visual excitement and technical sophistication Leni brings still astonish. Even the title cards are deployed in a few clever visual gags! The movie only hits a slight bum note when the killer is identified, a reveal that did not live up to the thrilling chase that preceded it. The newly commissioned score by Arthur Barrow on the Flicker Alley release does a great job ratcheting up the tension."], "tt0020430": [], "tt0020668": ["A tour-de-force of chases, shootouts, and robbery, as \"The Bat\" terrorizes a city, and particularly the renters of a mansion where he makes his hideout.

Roland West teams with star Chester Morris once again to give us \"The Bat Whispers\" a year after the same team gave us \"Alibi\", one of the very good films from 1929, and a Best Picture nominee from the 1928-1929 season.West uses some of the same photographic techniques that were ground-breaking in \"Alibi\". The camera moves along so you see what the police see as they ride along in their squad cars, and now the camera also swoops up the sides of buildings and \"flies into\" rooms at a birds-eye (or bats-eye) view.\"The Bat\" is a super-criminal. He taunts the police by telling them what he intends to do next and then performs his crime under their noses. He dresses and moves like Batman, has the Joker's indifference to human life and confidence in his own immortality, but unlike the Joker his motive is not chaos - it is unmitigated greed. In that way he is like a merging of Batman, the Joker, and Bank of America.The rather complex plot involves a bank that has been robbed in which the suspect is a young teller who is in love with Una Merkel's character. Her aunt has rented an old dark house from the bank owner's son. However, someone is trying to frighten her into leaving. There are secret rooms and passageways, the mysterious activities of several guests involved, and the presence of Chester Morris as a police inspector who arrives on the scene. For some strange reason he is dressed as a middle-aged man here, and I could never figure out the reason for that one. The questions are - who is The Bat, is he at work here, is he working alone, and what is he after? The only negative is the maid in the old dark house. She is constantly screaming and yelping at every little noise. By the film's midpoint I was ready to dress up like The Bat and get rid of this annoying person myself. Alas, she survives until the end of the film without really adding anything. I get the fact that scary things are going on. I didn't need her 90 minute conniption fit to drive that point home.If you love early talkies you have to see this one. It came before Batman and Universal's old dark house sound films, so it actually is more original than the modern viewer might give it credit.", "Roland West's THE BAT WHISPERS was based on a hugely successful Broadway play, The Bat, widely credited for having created the vogue for thriller plays in the 1920's.  (The 1927 production \"Dracula\" which starred Bela Lugosi on stage was part of the mystery vogue, and led directly to the 1930 Universal film which kicked off the 30's cycle of horror movies).  West filmed The Bat in 1926 as a silent, with great success.  The 1930 remake was a large production, shot simultaneously in standard 35mm and a new widescreen 65mm process. Theater owners largely rejected the expense of installing 65mm equipment, and most people who saw this film on its release saw the 35mm version.Among them was Bob Kane, who credited it as a major influence in his creation of Batman in the late 30's.  It's easy to see why.  This is a stunning looking film (I'm referring to the 35mm version, which I saw at the 2004 UCLA Festival of Preservation) gorgeously photographed by Ray June.  In an old dark house where the lights are constantly going off, and lighting is frequently provided by candles, or lightning, bizarre lighting effects start to become the norm, and the dramatic possibilities take off.  The director used every conceivable angle to keep things visually lively, mirroring the ridiculous complexity of the plot with a visual complexity that always keeps the viewer slightly off balance.Much has been made of the sweeping camera moves and the use of miniatures. The miniatures are a bit obvious, but their intent remains effective if you're willing to go with it. (Being willing to \"go with it\" is pretty much a necessity in general for this film, which was a wild and unrealistic ride in its time, and deliberately so.)  The photography benefits from a number of technical innovations, including a lightweight camera dolly invented for this production that allowed the camera to be moved 18 feet vertically in a matter of moments.The performances - both comic and dramatic characters - are deliberately hokey, very stagey turns that were the standard for this genre.  Much of Chester Morris' mugging and squinting, however, are attributable to the violently bright underlighting that was used in his closeups, which eventually scorched his retinas (a condition which became known as Klieg Eye). Within that context, they are wonderful performances.  Morris is particularly engaging, as is Grayce Hampton as the patrician Cornelia Van Gorder, the middle-aged spinster who refuses to be scared out of the house.  (Hampton appears to be a very capable stage actress, and offers perhaps the most natural performance in the film.  She had made one previous film \u0096 in 1916 \u0096 and made numerous subsequent ones, usually in bit parts, until she was nearly 80.)  Her no-nonsense dowager centers the film perfectly, keeping the other characters (and performances) from plunging completely off the deep end.The plot?  A master criminal, The Bat,  is on the loose, a half-million dollars have been stolen from a bank by somebody else, and The Bat is trying to get it.  The money has apparently been brought to a lonely mansion in a rural town (apparently somewhere on then-rural Long Island) where a middle-aged woman and her made are renting for the summer. Someone is trying to scare her out of the house, so she has sent for detectives.  From there, anything goes.", "I avoided seeing The Bat Whispers for many years because I had seen a documentary called \"The Horror of it All\". In it they used clips and gave away the killer by showing us the ending!!! Not that it cannot be figured out by many. The great news is I thoroughly enjoyed the film (with many repeated viewings) anyway. It has become a Halloween tradition for me as I watch it once every year. The killer's identity is only part of the fun.My writing this post is due to a wonderful thunder storm we had that exactly matched the intensity and character of the storm in this film - Lightning with long pauses before thunder and NO RAIN.I have seen tons of old dark house mystery/horror/comedies from the 20s, 30s and 40s and I dare anyone to name better ones than this, Paul Leni's two mysteries, and Whale's The Old Dark House. Many of the ODH films of that time were poverty row. Some were downright boring, others interesting, but none with such a distinctive style as those mentioned. I cannot understand the harshness people can feel about this film. One has to put themselves in a mood to watch such a film. It was never intended to be incredibly meaningful like Ben- Hur, or All Quiet on the Western Front. This is pure pulp from start to end.The Bat Whispers, is in many ways, a forerunner to today's gigantic comic book movies. Some have much style (Batman, The Matrix, X-Men) and some are totally ridiculous with the same absurd plot holes (Batman, The Matrix, X-Men, etc.).So, what can one expect? A totally fun, old-fashioned mystery romp that satisfies one's need for shadows, lighting, special effects, atmosphere, mystery, horror and downright silliness. This is a masterpiece in the genre and also Roland West's greatest film. It is consistent with the films that West shot. It's a shame he didn't continue with his dark style of film-making. Chester Morris has been called a ham in these posts and that's true. And what terrific ham! He gives one of the best performances in an ODH movie. His intensity was perfectly enhanced by the powerful arc lamps that under lit him, so much so that he suffered scorched retinas and unfortunately suffered visually for the rest of his life. That is a man dedicated to the art of his film! Morris makes the proceeds far more interesting than any other 'detective' I have seen in this type of film. The supporting cast makes this effectively spooky (Gustav von Seyferritz as Ven Rees leads the way).Overall, this is stylish escapism at its' best in the old-fashioned sense. Special credit goes to the camera operators and art director. Both standard and widescreen versions are completely different takes and different films. I prefer the standard version, as Morris' close-ups are far more effective. The one when he returns and stands at the top of the stairs is avant-garde in how he is so perfectly centered and unnaturally under lit. I could go on.... a great fun film!", "Based on a play that was filmed four years earlier by the same director this is a wonderful film that is hampered only by the limitations of sound. That said this is probably the best version of the story.A fiend known as The Bat is lurking around the mansion of a rich family and its up to an intrepid detective to prevent him from getting the goods.This movie is a lot of fun, with several wonderful performances especially by Chester Morris as the detective.Interestingly the film was filmed both in the standard aspect ratio and in an early wide screen process (Both are on the DVD). The films are more or less identical, but since they were taken from different takes they both play like two different nights of the same play.I like this film a great deal and recommend it to anyone who likes the Old Dark House genre.", "Roland West first filmed the story of the Bat, a killer that steals money and jewels for their value as well as for adventure, in 1926.  He then made The Bat Whispers in 1930, which is a sound version of his silent film.  The transition is not entirely smooth yet rewarding.  Let me first state that the silent film is easily the superior of the two.  The silent film had a much more creepier feeling to it.  The acting was far superior, and the sets were incredible.  West does duplicate much of the sets and shots that were in his first version.  The acting, however, is not very good as it is obvious that sound pictures have not been around too long.  West tries to accommodate that new innovation which sometimes results in stagey scenes and long dialogue sessions.  Chester Morris is...well, to say the least...a ham. His performance is a bit over-the-top for me.  He does show glimmers of talent though.  The story is pretty much the same and that is the film's strength.  It's a fun mystery that by today's standards will seem crude and silly, but taken in context of its time should provide some entertainment. Oddly enough, the mystery seemed less mysterious in this version.  I knew who the killer was with ease(trying to distance myself from the memory of the first film as I did this).  West again has some impressive camera shots. The opening scene of the bat stealing a jewel from an apartment high in the sky was incredible as was the journey of the bat over a bank and following a man with a lot of money.  The camera work of West is innovative, and it is a pity that his life was cut short and we did not get a chance to see him employ his talents in other projects.", "Great fun! The special effects are amazing for a 1930 movie. Miniaturized sets are used & although they're primitive by today's standards, keep in mind that this movie is over 70 years old. It's an excellent Old Dark House movie, complete with thunderstorms, secret passageways, a mysterious creature named \"The Bat,\" comedic elements, a large old house, several murders, etc. It's been noted that the comic strip character, \"Batman,\" owes some of his origins to \"The Bat,\" & it's apparent in the outfit, the shadows cast from buildings, & in the name of the character itself. \"The Bat\" is indeed a pretty scary entity. The sound effects are good, camera work is excellent, & the ending is bizarre. It kept my interest throughout its 83 minutes. Well worth seeing for Old Dark House fans (this is one of the best). I rate it 9/10.", "No doubt about it, the silent screen acting technique is still present in this early talkie. Everyone behaves as though they had a case of first night stage jitters--and the supposedly comic moments are painfully obvious and tainted with smokehouse ham.But aside from the theatrics of some of the cast, this is an entertaining and truly spooky old dark house kind of comedy-mystery that was so popular during the '30s and '40s. What is most amazing is the fluidity of the camerawork through the innovative use of miniatures and the camera's ability to zoom forward and slink along the exteriors of an old mansion like a prowling cat. It is worth seeing alone for the atmospheric sets and photography, especially considering that this was filmed in 1930 when sound itself was only two years old.Only Chester Morris among the performers delivers a really credible performance acceptable by today's standards of acting. The others are way over the top--including Una Merkel and just about all of the supporting players with the exception of William Bakewell.If you're a fan of Mary Roberts Rinehart stories, you'll enjoy this version of her successful play. It's far superior to the later remake with Vincent Price. Be sure to see this in the newly released Wide Screen Version. It's a pristine transfer from the restoration by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.", "Yes, this film is dated. The acting is beyond hammy; only in the early talkies did movies contain this kind of unabashedly theatrical performing. Just when you think Chester Morris couldn't possibly twist his mouth--or curl his eyebrow--or twirl his finger--in a new way, he surprises you and offers a wholly different mugging expression he hadn't pulled out before. Along with the acting, the genre (the creepy old house with hidden panels etc.) became old hat by 1950.  So, all right, this movie is stilted and creaks.  However, for a film antiquarian, this motion picture is a joy.  Its sets and lighting are breathtaking, and one gathers from it why the play was one of the longest running on Broadway at the time.  I'll take it over the Vincent Price remake, THE BAT, anyday and I love Vincent Price.", "THE BAT WHISPERS has a convoluted history. Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1957) created this tale of a master criminal skulking around a creepy country mansion as the 1907 novel THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE. In 1917 Rinehart and playwright Avery Hopwood to adapted it to the stage. Retitled THE BAT, in 1920 it took Broadway by storm with its mixture of crazy characters, corny situations, and spooky atmosphere, and in 1926 film director Roland West brought the play to the screen. Once again it proved a great success; not only was the film an audience favorite, it was critically well-regarded too.It was also made just as sound began to roar. In 1930 West decided to remake the film as a \"talkie.\" He also decided to add a few innovative bells and whistles in a visual sense as well. Many directors of early sound films had enough to do in coping with sound technology--and so they tended to lock the camera down, a circumstance that gave most Hollywood films made between about 1929 and 1933 a visually static quality. Not so West: THE BAT WHISPERS would be noted for a remarkably fluid camera that made the most of detailed miniatures and lavish sets. But more than this, THE BAT WHISPERS would truly stun audiences of the day via a widescreen format.Widescreen format? In 1930? Surprising, yes, but true. Directors had tinkered with widescreen formats since the silent era, with French director Able Gance's 1927 masterpiece NAPOLEON a case in point--but although interesting, the results were hit and miss. With THE BAT WHISPERS, cinematographer Robert H. Planck nailed it flawlessly. He also left something of a puzzle: film historians are still not entirely sure how he brought it off. Most records seem to indicate that Planck actually shot the film on 35 mm, and then somehow managed to paste, cut, process, and reprint the original footage onto 70 mm. Regardless of how it was done, the result is astonishing, and every one who saw the film was amazed.Unfortunately, those who saw it were few and far between. Theatre owners were still recovering from the expense of buying audio systems and they were not in a mood to pay for an expensive new screen and projection system as well. When the film went into general release, it went in standard ratio filmed by cinematographer Ray June. Again, it is hard to say exactly how this was done, but looking at both versions it would seem that June took a fair amount of Planck's footage, cropped it, and then re-shot most key scenes directly onto 35 millimeter stock.We now come to something of a paradox. Planck's widescreen version is both visually beautiful and innovative--but Planck and director West were pretty much working without any precedent and they weren't quite sure of what do with the effect once they had it. Virtually everything is done in long shot, and when the camera isn't in motion THE BAT WHISPERS feels dry as dust and twice as slow. The June version, however, makes solid use of close-ups and medium shots, and while it sometimes feels a bit jumpy it has a better flow and a significantly better pace. Ironically, the June version is actually the more watchable of the two.But I use the word \"watchable\" in a comparative sense here. The style of acting that worked so well for silent film proved horrifically awkward in sound film, and directors and actors struggled for several years to find a new acting technique. Both versions of THE BAT WHISPERS find the cast struggling in the gulf between old and new. The Planck version tends to highlight the difficulties involved; the June version softens them--but whether it be Planck or June, the performances are chiefly notable for their awkward quality.The plot is also antiquated. Part of the charm of the novel, the 1920 play, and the 1926 film was the use of already old-fashioned plot ideas that had not yet worn out their welcome--but by 1930 the whole thing was wearing very thin, and it emerges here as overworked and lacking the necessary light touch. Every thing about the story had become very clich\u00e9d, and two years later director James Whale would wickedly spoof the entire genre with a film aptly titled THE OLD DARK HOUSE. Although the Rinehart story received one more major turn before the cameras in 1959 with Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead, the type of plot involved is now more often done tongue-in-cheek, with such films as MURDER BY DEATH and CLUE cases in point.So what, exactly, is the value of THE BAT WHISPERS for a modern, casual viewer? The answer, rather sadly, is \"not much.\" Hardcore fans of early 1930s film will likely enjoy the film, and film students interested in the history of cinematography cannot afford to miss it--but few others will be able to see beyond the awkward acting styles and now-absurd plot to experience the charm this film--in both widescreen and standard versions--had in 1930.The IMAGE DVD release is a bit problematic. In terms of picture, the standard ratio version has the occasional blip and blemish but has weathered very well. Although it has been restored, artifacts abound in the widescreen version; even so, the picture is very clean and they do not significantly detract from the film. Sound quality is a problem in both versions, less so in the standard ratio version, more so in the widescreen version. To some extent, this may be due to the recording technology of the era (actors tend to become fainter as they move away from the center of the sets), but it seems safe to say that the entire sound balance is off on this DVD release. You'll have to turn up the volume all the way to hear it--and where the widescreen version is concerned you'll also have to sit by the speakers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "Bat Whispers, The (1930)35mm version *** (out of 4)65mm version ** (out of 4)The master criminal known as The Bat steals a necklace even though he warned police that he was going to do it. They believe he's taken shelter inside an old house, which is full of shocks and surprised for the Detective (Chester Morris) on the case. This film has a pretty strange history behind it since Roland was remaking his earlier film from 1926 and was shooting two different versions. The 35mm version is the one being reviewed it and for the most part I was shocked at how well made it was. What really shocked me is that a lot of these early sound films are quite horrid and hard to understand but that's not the case here as everyone from the director to the cast seem perfectly normal working with the sound. The actors really take off and know how to work their dialogue, which again is something I wasn't use to seeing in such a early sound film. The visual look of this film mixed in with the sound makes the film appear to be something made later in the decade and not at the start. The cast all turn in impressive performances starting with Morris who has become a favorite of mine over the past couple years. It took me a little while to warm up to his type of delivery but once I did I really enjoyed watching him and his style of comedy. Una Merkel is also very good as is Chance Ward and Richard Tucker. The film offers up a lot of comedy and for the most part it works including a scene where the two older women are being questioned and are asked how old they are. One tells and lie and this is one of the highlights of the film. Even before we get to the two versions of the film it's also important to note that the film offers up one of the first \"dolly\" shots with a special camera that was created just for this film, which allowed it to move 18-feet in the matter of seconds. There's also a sweeping camera shot that is way ahead of its time even though the miniature used is easy to spot. Some might find the story or settings full of clich\u00e9s must one must remember that this is the film that influenced everything that would follow, which is saying quite a bit for director West as his 1926 film influenced all the future silent old dark house films. After the film we also get a quick \"warning\" from The Bat telling people not to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it.The 65mm version features the exact same story and cast but of course it's shown in an early widescreen format and features all new shots by a different cinematographer. It's really amazing at how different these two versions are and I'd say the 65mm is more of a curiosity than anything else. I think the best film is the 35mm version for various reasons. For one, the widescreen process being used here really takes you out of the action in several ways as the camera is far back from the actors and this here kills several of the comedy sequences. It's also worth noting that apparently shooting this way was very expensive so they couldn't do countless takes, which might explain a few instances where lines are messed up but the actors keep going. This might also explain why the performances here are a lot more lacking than in the other version. It almost appears that the cast members are worried about messing up and this too effects their work and once again the comedy is what appears hurt the most. It's always interesting seeing these early attempts at widescreen but I think in this case it really hurt the movie. There just seems to be way too much going on trying to get this trick to work that both the director and cast aren't up in their game.", "The film does feel creaky, the humor is laid a little too thick for my tastes at times (much like Paul Leni's THE CAT AND THE CANARY [1927], in fact) and Maude Eburne as the cowardly maid IS unbearable\u0085but this is more than made up for, in my opinion, by the film's dazzling cinematography, atmospheric sets and deliberate theatricality (complete with asides to the audience in the finale). In any case, it's easily miles ahead of the inept and boring Vincent Price remake of 1959! You will have noticed that I have preceded (as is my fashion) the film's name with that of its director. I'll be the first to admit that nearly nobody today remembers Roland West, let alone be prepared to accord him \"auteur\" status, but you'll agree that the VERY distinctive visual style of the film indicates an assured guiding hand behind the whole project. Although hardly as well-known today or as easy to find, THE BAT WHISPERS is by no means West's only notable feature; as a matter of fact, based on the minute information I've managed to find on them in my reference books, I'd be very interested in watching THE UNKNOWN PURPLE (1923; an intriguing-sounding precursor to James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN [1933]), THE BAT (1926; the original Silent-film version of THE BAT WHISPERS), the gangster drama ALIBI (1929; which even earned Chester Morris a Best Actor Academy Award nomination) and CORSAIR (1931), his last film. As for myself, the only other Roland West film I've seen is the atypical and rather unsatisfactory Lon Chaney vehicle THE MONSTER (1925), which also happens to be a bizarre 'old dark house' melodrama.Elliott Stein, in Richard Roud's indispensable tome, \"Cinema: A Critical Dictionary \u0096 The Major Film-Makers\" described Roland West as \"one of America's supremely original visual stylists, the director of a series of stunning thrillers.\" He also names ALIBI \"one of the most oppressive films ever made\u0085the distorted sets, odd angles and restless camera make it West's most Germanic work\u0085this claustrophobic little nightmare would be fully at home in a retrospective of the American avant-garde film.\" Furthermore, he acclaims THE BAT WHISPERS as \"a pictorial knock-out\" and CORSAIR \"a visual treat\"! Unfortunately, his promising career was suddenly curtailed by a real-life tragedy. West was involved and living with renowned comedienne Thelma Todd (a frequent foil for Laurel & Hardy and The Marx Brothers) in Malibu at the time of her mysterious death in 1935. Neighbors heard them quarreling the night before the morning she was found in her garage overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning; though a suspect, he was never arrested but, of course, he could never work in Hollywood (or elsewhere) again.I've only watched THE BAT WHISPERS (twice), in Widescreen, on VHS and I've been meaning to pick up Image's DVD edition (comprising also the 'alternate' full-frame version, shot simultaneously by a different cameraman!) for the longest time. As it happens, from the online reviews I've read of the disc, the verdict as to which version is actually 'better' seems to be pretty mixed.", "This is a great old black and white mystery/suspenser.  If you have the capacity to enjoy films of the 30's and 40's and you like mysteries and fine film craftsmanship, see his movie. Chester Morris is very good as the lead. The plot is relatively true to the Hopwood/Rinehart original screenplay. The setting is an old mansion with a spinster and family members terrified by a super criminal known as the Bat.  They get outside help, but the Bat strikes anyway.  Who is the Bat? What does he want in the old mansion? The story answers those questions in a most old-fashioned, entertaining manner. Of the three movie versions of the Bat, the 1926 silent, the 1950's Vincent Price/Agnes Moorhead version, and this one, this is the best.", "This is part of the \"Old Dark House\" genre. It involves a mysterious character called \"The Bat.\" He is very industrious. He is basically a thief, using his acrobatic gifts to get his hands on money and jewels. Here a half a million dollars taken from a bank is in a house full of secret passageways and lots of stairs. A host of characters run around, some after the money, others there due to circumstances. At time the people are so stupid and so frenetic, things deteriorate (particular on of the old women). It's also hard to tell who is who. But if you put any reality aside, you will enjoy this early venture into sound.", "I've watched the 1926, 1930 and 1930 wide screen versions many times over the years. However, the other day I finally watched the widescreen on my 5x6 foot screen which I usually save for 3D and football. The details really jumped out. There are so many wonderful camera tricks, many of which I cannot explain. As a professional modeler I can say that the miniatures were far ahead of their time, as was the skill in photographing them. They probably were only exceeded beginning with the Star Wars attack on the death star.The fluidity of the camera was amazing for its time. The old lady and the maid walk down a long corridor, talking all the time as the camera moves ahead of them. They walk into a room and sit at a table which was right in the path of the camera. Later in the film a character vaults over a 3 foot wall and runs down a path with the camera following him, apparently right through the wall. The shadows of the Bat as he hulks on the floor are inhuman. On several startling occasions the characters jump right into the camera. These and more have been mastered for years but this film discovered them. If you are familiar with the climax of The Alibi, you remember the special effect that seemed almost real, not surpassed until CGI. The Bat Whispers is filled with such effects.Yes, the film is static, despite all the goings on. And the acting, although unacceptable by 1932 standards was about average for 1930. However, I would gladly have strangled Maude Eburn who ruined every scene she was in. The Bat Whispers is really a guilty pleasure for modelers, cinematographers and horror fans.", "A gripping psychological thriller based upon an old play, this first of three talkie versions (later done simply as \"The Bat\" in 1959 with both a theatrical and TV version), this version holds up in spite of being creaky. A crook known as \"the bat\" searches through the country home of elderly Grayce Hampton for stolen items, scaring various people and killing some as well. The bat's identity is the mystery, and the horror elements come from the frights that shiver various people's timbers, especially maid Maude Eburne. Hampton's niece (Una Merkel) believes herself to be responsible for one man's death, but the audience knows differently. It's up to detective Chester Morris to piece everything together, but many of those pieces don't fit and the suspects seem far too guilty to quickly dismiss.Some audience members might be annoyed by Maude Eburne's constant screeching, but I found her hysterical, just as delightful as she was a few years later in the extremely low budgeted \"Vampire Bat\", similar to this in many ways. Hampton is perfectly demanding as the matriarch, and Gustav Von Seyferritz eccentric and eerie as a creepy doctor. The slow pacing, stagy direction, moody photography and odd lack of a musical background increase the chilling atmosphere, perfectly staged on a fabulous set by director Roland West. I'd love to see the silent versions of this, possibly gone forever, but this version is nearly as close to feeling like a silent film as you can get. I took delight in rewinding and rewatching the scene where Eburne flies through her window after the bat pulls the bear trap chain that Eburne smartly attaches to her own bed.", "From the memorable opening scene of the newsboy yelling \"You won't get the Bat! I'll bet the Bat makes a chump out of you!\" to the police, it was clear this would be a much more stylish film than the 1926 one. Roland West directed both films. This one is markedly superior visually and, unlike a lot of other directors at the time, West seems to make the transition from silent to sound filmmaking seamlessly. I've seen all three versions of The Bat and enjoyed them all but this is probably the best version. This is also the version that, according to Bob Kane, was part of the inspiration for Batman. The Bat looks less silly here than in the last movie, where he had big mouse ears and was more adorable than scary. Anyway, it's a good old dark house thriller with a cool beginning and an amusing ending. Any movie with Una Merkel in it can't be that bad.", "Like `The Cat and the Canary', `The Bat' has been filmed many times and is a highly influential example of the `Old Dark House' type of spooky murder mystery popular in the 1920s and 30s. Based on a successful stage play by Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood, both the play and the various film versions of it seems slightly antiquated now, although both combine enough humour with thrills to remain sufficiently interesting. The opening scenes of this version, `The Bat Whispers' are said to have greatly influenced the Batman cycle and Bob Kane.One can see why The gloomy 30s expressionist art-deco architecture, the shadowy figure of a man-sized, bat-like figure seen against walls and windows, and the way in which the character of the Bat is built up to give the master criminal an almost supernatural aura are very well done. Unfortunately, the film's early promise is let down somewhat as it drifts into what amounts to little more than a filmed version of the stage play, somewhat hammily conducted y some of its stars.The plot \u0096 big-time crook the Bat takes time to haunt a mansion rented to a retired gentlewoman for the summer while other mysterious events are going on \u0096 keeps one generally entertained. The high points of the film after the opening scenes establishing the exact nature of the Bat's criminal activities, featuring a daring robbery and murder, lie in the performance of star Chester Morris and some imaginative photographic tricks. A camera zooms in on a country mansion, and continues right inside the house, giving a dizzying, high-speed tour of the creepy building. At one point Anderson (Morris) runs down the garden and the camera travels with him, taking the viewer right into the heart of the action. Certainly, director Roland West and his team were able to use tricks like this to their benefit at a time when few other directors had even grasped the effective use of sound (also used imaginatively in `The Bat Whispers'). It is these elements that give it a more modern feel than many films of that bygone era now possess. The finale, in which the Bat is finally unmasked, also shows considerable understanding of cinematic technique. That is not to say that the film is wholly accessible to a modern audience. Overall it is too talky and some of the performances, particularly Gustav Von Seyffertitz as Dr Venner (whose English is almost inaudible), occasionally make the film hard going.However, lovers of the old dark house genre will revel in it and the performances of Morris as slick city detective Andersen and Una Merkle as the love interest more than make up for the deficiencies of others.Certainly an unusual film and one many will want to come back to as each reviewing brings previously unseen images into the mind.", "With long lines to see \"Garbo Talks!\" director Roland West and United Artists hoped to make you laugh and bring in some cash for \"The Bat Whispers\" - but, fewer people were interested in hearing The Bat-Man whisper. Moreover, he doesn't really \"whisper\" in this re-make of Mr. West's popular and influential silent version of \"The Bat\" (1926) - he talks. Neither of the Bat-films are truly magnificent, but both are technically excellent. The plot is almost the same; obviously, West started with the same script.The earlier version featured Jewel Carmen and Jack Pickford as lead the romantic couple; herein, they are successfully replaced by Una Merkel (as Dale) and William Bakewell (as Brooks). Broadway lady Grayce Hampton (as Cornelia Van Gorder) handles the knitting chores. Also moving from stage to film, comic relief Maude Eburne (as Lizzie) doesn't quite match Louise Fazenda (a daunting task). For the re-make, Chester Morris (as Anderson) takes center stage, as part of an uneasily altered story development.While West's technical skill is brilliant, but the sound of \"The Bat\" whispering is startlingly inferior - with the thunder sounding more like a foghorn from \"Anna Christie\" (one of those films with that talking Swedish actress). The wide-screen \"Magnifilm\" and visuals are terrific, though. Both films are worth seeing - in any order; the endings are different, but the mystery never mattered.******* The Bat Whispers (11/13/30) Roland West ~ Chester Morris, Una Merkel, William Bakewell, Grayce Hampton", "In the late 1920s until about the mid 1930s, Hollywood produced quite a few 'old, dark house' films. This genre always consisted of a group of people stuck in an old mansion as a maniac runs about trying to fill them off one-by-one. \"The Old Dark House\", \"The Cat and the Canary\" and \"The Black Cat\" are just a few examples of these films--as is \"The Bat Whispers\". So, while some today might be more impressed by this film than me, perhaps it's because they don't realize that the plot is very standard fare. And, aside from a few technical innovations, this is a rather poor example as well--mostly because it's so dreadfully boring.The film begins with folks talking about 'The Bat'--a daring and murderous thief whose identity is unknown and who has long eluded the police. Most of the film centers on one particular mansion and a group of people who run about trying to avoid being his next victims. And, at the end, the mystery is, of course, unraveled.This is an unusual film because the DVD has both a standard version and a unique 65mm version they also made for theaters. I watched the 65mm version and I could understand why some of the other reviewers disliked it. The overall look was akin to watching a film while standing far from the screen--very, very far. In other words, although they were innovating with the cinematography, they really didn't understand how to effectively utilize it. It's odd, as although they tried to innovate when it came to the picture, the sound is ancient by 1930 standards--with no incidental music and very flat sound. Overall, it's a film that looks unique (with some nice shadows and camera angles), sounds bad and bores the viewer to tears. A nice experiment--but one that just isn't very satisfying viewing.", "When you hear the Bat whisper, you don't know whether to smile at the dated melodrama or admire some classy scenic set ups and camera work. The film may show its age with acting that is over the top, broad comic relief and a solution that for modern audiences is fairly easy to anticipate, but it looks great. The film was shot in an early version of wide-screen as well as a standard release version, using different cinematographers, cameras and set-ups. The wide-screen version is the one to watch. This is an old-dark-house creeper-thriller, with a stormy, thundering night, lots of shadowed stone staircases, massive doors and fireplaces, things that bump and thump, and, of course, a hidden room which may contain thousands of dollars stolen from a bank. More to the point, the film has a master villain who creeps and slides around wearing a bat outfit. He can shimmy up a rope in a flash or hang head down while he tips a victim out of a high window. And for fans of Bob Kane's Batman comic books plus all those Batman movies, this Bat is the grandaddy of both. He...it?...casts harsh, disturbing shadows of a tall figure with huge bat wings attached to unnaturally long arms. Is this just the work of the shadows or are his victims dispatched by some hideously deformed creature? And it whispers. All we know for sure is that the Bat is determined to frighten...or kill...his way to the stolen fortune.The movie was based on a hugely popular stage play. The number of characters is almost large enough to make its own crowd scene. Whenever things get really tense, it seems a new character suddenly pops up. In this old mansion is the owner, a grande dame named Cornelia Van Gordon (Grace Hampton), an imperious woman with a vast bosom, a sturdy waist and a shrewd mind. How shrewd? She knows the new gardener is not what he seems when she asks him what he thinks of rubeola and he says it's a nice plant. Mrs. Van Gordon has a niece, Dale Van Gordon (Una Merkel), who seems a typical brainless flapper until we realize she's in cahoots with the false gardener. There is also a loyal maid, Lizzie (Madge Eburne), who has hysterics, rolls her eyes, prepares bear traps, sits on funny objects and acts like a cross between Patsy Kelly and Harpo Marx. There's a mysterious doctor, a small town elderly police lieutenant, a butler, a handyman who shakes violently when the Bat whispers, and a smart, big city cop, Detective Anderson, who is determined to catch the Bat and solve the bank robbery. We are faced with a question as simple as the plot, just who among all these characters could be the Bat?Anderson is played by Chester Morris. If you're familiar with Morris' work you may recall him as a tough-guy leading man in a lot of Thirties movies. He never quite got both feet firmly on the A-level actors' list but never entirely was considered just another B-level lead. He exuded no-nonsense confidence, a kind of tall Jimmy Cagney without most of Cagney's empathy. He was always, in my opinion, an interesting actor. Then in 1941 in Meet Boston Blackie, he played Blackie, another tough, good guy detective. He was so good in the role he was instantly type cast. He played Boston Blackie in many movies during the Forties, each one a little worse than the other as the studio turned the series into a cash cow. By the time the string ran out, Chester Morris, who could be a fine actor, found himself doing television and regional theater. He killed himself with an overdose of sleeping pills in 1970 while starring in The Caine Mutiny Court Marshal at a theater in Pennsylvania. As Detective Anderson, Morris gives an odd performance that combines a clipped, sort of semi-off-and-on British inflection with a high degree of intensity.The thing that makes The Bat Whispers of interest is the use of miniatures, especially at the beginning, the use of camera tracking shots that pull us away while walls slide back or that take us from a clock tower down to a street. Considering the weight of cameras in 1930, these shots are a tour de force. Some stunning lighting shows up, particularly when the Bat is framed against back lighting that is almost blindingly bright. And it is genuinely unnerving when the giant shadow of the bat shrivels down toward the floor and a dark, hunched shape rises up and starts slowly to limp towards us.On balance, I think The Bat Whispers is something more than just an old and odd curiosity, but just barely.", "Well for heaven's sake, who would have thought that once upon a time Una Merkel would have been considered leading lady material. Not for very long though as the next year, 1931, she played Ricardo Cortez's sexy secretary, Effie, in the original \"The Maltese Falcon\". She was a discovery of D.W. Griffith who thought she had a Lillian Gish look about her and she did extra work in \"Way Down East\" and \"The White Rose\". So when she went to United Artists in 1930 Griffith thought she would be ideal as Ann Rutledge for his \"Abraham Lincoln\" but it was on a Fox loan out that her brilliant comedy vein was found. In Roland West's talkie remake of his 1926 success \"The Bat\" she starred alongside \"Mr. Versatile\" Chester Morris who was already being noted for his anti-hero parts.West certainly tried to experiment with camera shots and sound (much like with his \"Alibi\" of the previous year) - from the panning shot from the top of the clock tower to the street below, there is a cacophony of noise - sirens, police radios, newsboys jeering at the police's inability to catch the Bat who has just claimed another victim. Most people would be familiar with the plot that centres around the Fleming residence where Miss Van Gorder and her petrified maid (Maude Eburne) pass an eventful night. First visitor is Van Gorder's niece, Dale (Merkel) who brings her boyfriend (William Bakewell), who is disguised as Bailey, a jobbing gardener - in reality he is on the run having been falsely accused of embezzling funds from the bank at which he is a teller. They are both convinced that the missing money is hidden in the house - but in this crazy place no one is who they appear, even the owner, Fleming, is out to find the money for himself and there is also a strange doctor (Gustav Von Seyffertitz) who seems to have a morbid fascination with matches.Keeping the whole movie ticking along is Chester Morris as the mesmerizing, handsome detective Anderson - you just can't take your eyes off him, even though he doesn't make his appearance until 30 minutes after the movie has started. This movie is just terrific fun and trumps the silent one by having a powerful actor in the leading role (Jack Pickford was the star in the original - he played Bailey!!). Bob Kane did get the idea for Batman from the 1926 movie which did have a clearly defined bat's head as a silhouette and also flashed the bat insignia up in the sky - whenever the Bat was about to strike again. \"The Bat Whispers\" had plenty of atmosphere and frights and the bat costume, when illuminated by shadows, filled the screen - but it was easy to see it was only a costume after all. And the ending was great!! Chester Morris actually comes on to the stage and chats with the audience, asking them not to divulge the ending to their friends!! For a stage trained actor he was a complete natural in front of the camera and you have to scratch your head and wonder why he didn't become a major star. Maybe he was just too good!!!", "No movie that mentions both socialism and rheumatism in the same breath can afford to be passed up. Yeah, it's an antique that also plays like one. But it's got some really compelling visuals, especially the early shots of the bat in action, creepy shadows and all. And catch those artistic compositions that pop up unexpectedly, a real treat for the eye. Then there're the wicked zoom shots zeroing in on subjects like a targeted bullet. It's almost like these great visuals are at war at times with the terrible acting (excepting old lady van Gorder). In fact, I was rooting for The Bat to put several of those so-called comedic characters out of their whining misery so I could be put out of mine.Maybe you can figure out the plot because I had real trouble. Part of the problem was keeping track of all the characters who kept popping up out of nowhere. Plus, I had difficulty identifying who they were probably because director West never uses close-ups that would help. Now, I understand that the bad acting was the hammy style of the day, but I don't understand why the absence of helpful close-ups. Anyway, it's an odd little film with both real faults and real strengths. I'm just sorry director West got mixed up with Hollywood's shady side and destroyed his career. Meanwhile, I took the epilog pledge so I won't be disclosing the identity of the mystery man, which won't be too hard since I still haven't figured it out anyway.", "On the Cusp Between Sound and Silents.A Fascinating Expressionistic Fun-Film with Visuals that are Stunning.But the Seriously Dated Comedic Histrionics are a Set-Back From Greatness.The First 20 Min.

I discovered it on one of my forays upstairs and nearly jumped out of my shorts when I accidentally got it to chime. The room had pretty much the same old dark house atmosphere of the mansion in this movie, and with very little lighting, the thing just scared the bejeezus out of me. But eventually I got over it and managed to play it over and over again as the weeks went by. I had to quit though when I found out a gorilla lived up there, that was about the same time I saw \"King Kong\" for the first time.So this picture must have had it's fans back in the very early days of talking movies, and for that one can give it some credit. It doesn't take too long to realize that there might have been some inspiration here for the character of Batman in the comic book world, who made his debut in Detective Comics #27 in May of 1939. So that was almost a full decade later. Not only the character, but there was also that cool smokescreen effect produced by the getaway car right after the 'Bat' pulled off the bank heist. Add to that the various pulleys and ropes the Bat used in the story and you had a lot of early material being tested out here for the Caped Crusader to put into his repertoire.Story wise though, unless you're a patient sort and willing to watch just about anything (which I am), the picture can be a chore. The best thing going for it in my estimation was the great atmospherics - the dark corridors, the revolving fireplace and that makeshift laundry chute that got used a couple of times. It appears the film makers were going for comedy along with the horror/mystery element, and I couldn't help thinking that it would have passed muster if Laurel and Hardy might have shown up. But gee, most of the players wound up screeching or going into exaggerated hysterics whenever something ominous was about to happen, and for me that was something of a turn-off.And Chester Morris - man, his facial expressions were just hilarious. I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't - when he revealed himself to be The Bat I thought it was just the dumbest thing. Here he's proclaiming \"I've got the greatest brain that ever existed\" while his foot's caught in a bear trap and he's wrapped in a chain by the unwitting action of some other characters. It occurred to me that all of this could have been avoided if Detective Anderson (Morris) simply didn't show up. As the Bat he pulled off the jewel heist and bank robbery, so why was he even at the Van Gorder mansion to investigate a jewel heist and bank robbery?But the best had to be the time Dr. Venrees (Gustav von Seyferrtitz) began wildly shooting at the presumed villain escaping up the stairs. With his first four shots fired, there were already more than a dozen bullet holes in the wall! It's enough to drive you batty."], "tt0020748": ["I don't know why the previous reviewer was so hard on a film he's never seen! THE CAT CREEPS is a \"lost\" film. To the best of my knowledge, it has never been seen since it's original release in late 1930. The film is worthy of rediscovery for several reasons, including:A) It has a great cast...one of the best of any film released in 1930;B) The film was directed by Rupert (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA) Julian;C) It could be considered the first Universal sound horror film, predating DRACULA by 3 months;D) Cast members Lilyan Tashman and Blanche Friderici co-starred the following year in a wonderful mystery-horror film, MURDER BY THE CLOCK;E) Star Helen Twelvetrees was a popular early talkie actress...she, along with Constance Bennett, Nancy Carroll, Mae Clarke, Ann Harding,  Billie Dove, et al,  typified the early sound era;I hope this title is rediscovered. Paging Kino Video......", "An 'old dark house' mystery based on the play The Cat and the Canary.How does one write a review of this lost 'old dark house' mystery? Either the reviewer is very old and has an excellent memory (like minstrel3), or they have in their possession the only existing copy and aren't willing to share. Or maybe they're just making stuff up.Less than two minutes of footage from The Cat Creeps is known to exist, gleaned from a compilation short from 1932 titled 'Boo'; the footage shows a mysterious figure with a hairy, clawed hand emerging from behind a secret panel to terrify Annabelle West (Helen Twelvetrees). It's impossible to ascertain the quality of an entire movie from such brief clips (although 81 people have somehow managed to rate the film on IMDb thus far), suffice to say that it looks like standard spooky old mansion shenanigans.It's a real shame that the film remains lost -- perhaps the reviewer who gave it such a detailed appraisal will be willing to share their copy one day...", "I was 7 when I saw it. I am now three days into 86 and I can still internalize -- vividly -- all of the scary parts, scene by scene and shot by shot. And after seeing it, I wouldn't go to bed with the lights off for months. Also, for many years I was not allowed to see, among others, \"The Invisible Man,\" \"Frankentein,\" \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" and \"Dracula.\"I didn't mind.But I do mind that the film is lost and has been for years. I've been trying to find it so I could see it and exorcize it.Plus one other thing: They didn't do Parent Guides in 1930, but wouldn't you think it might not be such a great idea to send your seven-year-old to see a movie called \"The Cat Creeps\"?", "\"The Cat Creeps\" is the last film directed by Rupert Julian, whose single best-known credit is the silent version of \"The Phantom of the Opera\", starring Lon Chaney. But Chaney and Julian quarrelled bitterly during production of that film: Julian was ultimately dismissed from the set, and Chaney took over the direction himself (with an uncredited assist by Edward Sutherland). So, Julian's reputation is based on a film which he largely didn't direct. \"The Cat Creeps\" is probably a better indication of his talents, which weren't much.\"The Cat and the Canary\" was a spooky-old-house stage play by John Willard, which was filmed several times. The two most notable versions are Paul Leni's 1927 moody silent film and the 1939 remake which played up the comedy relief and made a star of Bob Hope. \"The Cat Creeps\" is the first talkie version, made only three years after Leni's silent, and probably retitled so as to avoid comparisons.It's a poor film. Many early sound-era films were much more ponderous than late silent films, due to the heavy sound-recording equipment and the bulky mufflers (called \"blimps\") that were needed to soundproof the cameras. Even by early talkie standards, \"The Cat Creeps\" is a VERY slow film, in every way inferior to the 1927 and 1939 versions.The film sticks very close to Willard's play and the Leni version. Ten years after a miser's death, his relatives meet in his creepy old house for the reading of the will. (Isn't it actually illegal to delay the reading of a will this long?) The terms of the will are read out by Lawyer Crosby: the other characters keep calling him \"Lawyer Crosby\", as if that's his name. Annabelle West (Helen Twelvetrees) stands to inherit the lot, unless she conveniently goes insane (from, let's say, terror .. or maybe boredom) before she leaves the old house. If Annabelle goes bonkers, then all the lovely lolly goes to... suddenly the lights go out! When they go on again, Lawyer Crosby has vanished into thin heir.Oh, yeah, I forgot. There's a homicidal maniac loose on the premises. (No home should be without one.) He's known only as the Cat, but evidence indicates that the Cat is also one of the disinherited relatives ... who might just inherit after all if Annabelle is driven insane. (Why doesn't he just kill her?) Meanwhile, Lawyer Crosby's corpse falls out of the cupboard. Where's the will? Stodgy Neil Hamilton, warming up (or cooling off) for his future role as Commissioner Gordon in the \"Batman\" TV series, flusters his way through his role here as Annabelle's handsome protector ... or could he possibly be the evil Cat?\"The Cat Creeps\" was made during Universal Studios' great period of horror films, so it's disappointing that this movie delivers so little \"boo!\" for the buck. Helen Twelvetrees displays so little screen presence, she ought to be pruned down to Helen Threetrees. As for her acting ability ... well, she's pretty to look at, but that's all. If you've seen another version of \"The Cat and the Canary\", you know how this version ends. In fact, this version offers nothing that isn't done better in the '27 or '39 version, or both. Skip this unnecessary remake. It's alleged \"historic\" significance is negligible.", "This. Film.

People haven't put much effort into finding this film, and it's still unlikely that it ever will be found.Chances are this film wasn't even that good though. Very few films are actually lucky enough to survive more than 10 years."], "tt0021814": ["\"I bid you welcome,\" \"I never drink wine,\" \"Children of the night...what music they make,\" and of course \"I am Dracula\" are memorable lines that resonate throughout horror films, literature, art, etc... throughout the 20th century because of a landmark film made in 1931 starring Bela Lugosi and directed by Tom Browning.  This film was the birth of the horror film as we know it.  Its importance can not be underestimated.  Dracula is a wonderful film for so many reasons, but first let's look at its many faults.The film is by today standards very antiquated.  It has almost no soundtrack, stage acting for the most part, limited special effects, and a slow pacing.  It has long parts of little action and lots of chat.  It shows little while leaving much to one's imagination(a plus for those like myself that are good at envisioning what is not shown).  With all this not going for it, why is Dracula such a classic?  Why is it considered to be such a great film and a great horror film?The answer is that even with all these flaws (and bear in mind some of these flaws are not flaws for all) the film offers a rich story in an eerie, atmospheric way.  Bela Lugosi was Dracula.  He was the model for oh so many vampires to come.  His gesturing, his deliberation in speech, his facial movements all created a vampire never to be forgotten.  Despite Lugosi, however, is the real genius of the film....Tod Browning.  Browning created a movie and a setting hitherto imagined and conjured on a screen.  Browning was the man behind the camera that created the cob-webbed stairs of the Dracula castle and the squalid emptiness of the crypt.  He created the ghoulish female vampires thirsting for blood.  Dracula is not just a film to see, it is film history and should be viewed with that in mind and not put under a microscope of today's languishing tastes.", "\"Dracula\" is a true cinematic classic that still hold up well today more than 70 years after its initial release. Bram Stoker's novel had been filmed before, most notably the 1922 German masterpiece \"Nosferatu\" with Max Schrenk playing the vampire as a monstrous rat like creature with no redeeming qualities.Bela Lugosi rose to instant fame with his portrayal of Dracula, a part he had been playing on stage for several years. Lugosi's interpretation is that of a suave and sophisticated nobleman with a hypnotic stare and a cultured Hungarian accent. This made the character more appealing to the ladies while at the same time terrifying to the audience when we see the monster revealed beneath.The story has the tragic Renfield (Dwight Frye) arriving in Transylvania to complete a transaction with the Count which will allow him to lease a English castle. Before they leave for England by ship, Dracula turns Renfield into a quasi-vampire who obeys his master's every command. Upon arriving in England it is discovered that all of the ship's crew have been murdered and only a raving lunatic of a Renfield remain alive.Renfield is committed to a sanitarium run by Dr. Seward (Herbert Bunston). Dracula seeks him out and discovers Seward's comely daughter Mina (Helen Chandler) and her friend Lucy. Dracula quickly \"kills\" Lucy and sets his sights upon Mina whose fiance Jonathon Harker (David Manners) is baffled by her sudden change in health and personality. Seward consults with a colleague Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) who quickly identifies the source of the problem as a vampire. They soon expose Dracula for what he is and......The atmospheric sets of this movie set the tone for the story. Dracula's castle is dark, damp and web filled and his cellar is positively scary. So too is his English manor with the classic winding stair case leading to the cellar. The opening theme I found to be equally foreboding and frightening. I wonder how many of those early film goers realized that it was adapted from the classic ballet \"Swan Lake\".Bela Lugosi should have become a major star after this film, but did not. His first mistake was the turning down the role of the monster in \"Frankenstein\" (1931). He did enjoy moderate success in the first half of the 30s playing various mad scientists and criminal masterminds. But he also accepted roles in several \"poverty row\" quickies which did little to advance his career. He had a brief return to glory in 1939 when he played \"Ygor\" in \"The Son of Frankenstein\" and again in 1948 again as Dracula in \"Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein\". With his well documented personal demons, Lugosi wound up his career in cheap \"B' movies ultimately becoming the \"star\" in some of Ed Wood's \"classics\". Oddly enough, though he was forever identified with the Dracula character, he only played him on screen twice, in 1931 and 1948 as noted. He did play \"Dracula like\" characters in MGM's \"Mark of the Vampire\" (1935) and in Columbia's \"Return of the Vampire\" (1943).Dwight Frye almost steals \"Dracula\" from Lugosi with his portrayal of Renfield. He takes him from a young ambitious businessman to a half crazed lunatic and back again. After this and his role of Fritz the hunchback in \"Frankenstein\", this great character actor never again achieved such heights. A real tragedy. Oddly enough, Stoker's book portrays Renfield as a minor character and it is Jonathon Harker who makes the unfortunate trip to Transylvania.Also filmed in a Spanish language version.", "It's almost impossible not to love 'Dracula', a horror milestone that is the most important and influential vampire movie ever made. Bela Lugosi became a cinematic legend after this movie, and his portrayal of Dracula basically invented the modern vampire as we know it. Murnau's silent classic 'Nosferatu' was an obvious influence on Todd Browning, but while Browning was no James Whale (the innovative British director who made 'Frankenstein' for Universal a few months after this) he added a lot of his own style and ideas to the project, and Counts Orloff and Dracula are completely different kinds of creatures. Lugosi made his Count sophisticated, attractive and sexy, and this is what made this movie such a sensation at the time, and what helps make it still a wonderful viewing experience. Lugosi's performance is one of the greatest in horror history. Some of the other actors in the cast are a bit shaky but Edward Van Sloan as Van Hesling is excellent and Dwight Frye's Renfield (a different character from the book) is also memorable. Both actors would reappear in 'Frankenstein'. 'Dracula' is an important landmark horror movie, but even better, is still a fantastic viewing experience seventy years later. Don't just watch it because it's a classic, watch it because it's wonderful entertainment!", "Thinking back to 1931, it's hard to imagine what going to the movie theater was like for people. It was something new and exciting; instead of having 6 movies open in one weekend, they were lucky if 6 movies opened in one month. Horror movies were nothing new in 1931, but one's with sound were and Universal Studios cranked out hit after hit after hit, one of the first being was Dracula. Not too many people realize that these films created exactly what we think of the typecast today with the most popular monsters. Dracula, if you've read the book, is nothing like what Bela created: the cape, the accent, the charm, the presence, the looks, etc. This was the first time we ever had a romantic Dracula, the silent film released before called Nosferatu was a monster, Bela created a Dracula that could charm you one second and the next he's draining the life out of you. Dracula is one of the most memorable movies of all time and it's not hard to see why when you watch it.Renfield, a British solicitor, travels to the Carpathian Mountains. He enters a castle welcomed by charming but odd nobleman Count Dracula, who unbeknownst to Renfield, is a vampire. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula's three wives suddenly appear and start to move toward Renfield to attack him, but Dracula waves them away, and he attacks Renfield himself. Aboard the Vesta, bound for England, Renfield has now become a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who is hidden in a coffin and gets out for feeding on the ship's crew. Some nights later at a London theater, Dracula meets Dr. Seward, who introduces his daughter Mina, her fianc\u00e9 John Harker, and the family friend Lucy Weston. Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula, and that night, after Lucy has a talk with Mina and falls asleep in bed, Dracula enters her room as a bat and feasts on her blood. She dies in an autopsy theater the next day after a string of transfusions, and two tiny marks on her throat are discovered. Later on Mina has the same bite marks and now the men call on Professor Van Helsing to take on Dracula and save Mina before she meets the same fate as Lucy.Despite the fact that it might not be as terrifying as it was back in the day, you have to consider that this movie made people faint in the theater and gave them nightmares for years to come. The film does have flaws, Lucy dies and that's it, she never comes back which was interesting that Mina was becoming a vampire when bitten, but Lucy doesn't. However, the atmosphere of the film still holds up incredibly well, Dracula's castle has the perfect shadows and isolation that could send shivers down anyone's spine. Makes you wonder how the heck Renfield could stay in that place? I would've camped outside, especially when Dracula comes down and says in that creepy voice \"I bid you welcome\"; would you trust someone like that while looking at your neck like it was a Thanksgiving turkey leg? Bela gave a terrific performance that will be remembered for all time. But also much credit to Dwight Frye who plays Renfield and still has one of the most horrific images of all time when they open the door on the ship to see him laughing manically with his eyes wide open. Not to mention his scene with the maid where he's laughing at her, she faints and he crawls towards her. You know what? I lied; this is still a scary movie and I will continue to watch it every Halloween. Bela is king and made Dracula one of the most terrifying monsters in movie history.9/10", "I suppose we all have differing opinions on what is scary and what isn't.For my money though,this film tops my list.I have seen many a horror film,but few have made me shiver as this one did.The creepy silence virtually throughout the movie,coupled with Bela Lugosi's intimidating presence and Dwight Frye's chilling performance as Renfield(remember the eyes and the laughter?)give me chill bumps on top of chill bumps just thinking about it.Yes,the movie has flaws, but they are few and far between.Hey,it was 1931 after all,and movie making was still in it's infancy.I have seen the various opinions on this film,good and bad,and while it may not top a lot of people's list when it comes to scariest movie ever,it sure tops mine.Bone chilling!", "Bela Lugosi forever captures the role of a certain undead Transylvanian count who takes a trip to London in the first legitimate version of the classic Bram Stoker novel.  Despite many attempts by many talented film makers, I believe this version, directed by Tod Browning, remains the definitive take on the often-filmed novel.  But why?  Is it simply nostalgia?  Granted, I do fondly remember staying up late as a child watching this film on Ghost Host theater and finding myself suitably frightened.  However, if I were the same age today, would I find the film as effective?  Would a steady diet of more modern and explicit horror films made me too jaded to enjoy the more subtle charms of this film?  I hope not, but I could see how it might.  The film is slow, and its slowness is further emphasized by the absence of an under score.  It is stagey - being as it was more influenced by the stage play than the novel itself.  Also, the story plays itself out too quickly.  Van Helsing manages to figure everything out and dispatch the count in about two seconds.  There simply isn't much suspense - and even less gore or violence.  Yet it remains the champ.  Why? The main reason is Lugosi himself.  He gives the performance of a lifetime. He truly inhabits the role and is genuinely creepy.  The rest of the cast, particularly Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield, support him admirably.  However, when I watch the old Universal horror films nowadays, I find myself really enjoying the atmospheric sets and lighting. Yes, there is still much to love about Dracula today.  (As long as you avoid the optional Philip Glass score on the DVD!)", "Dracula(1931) mayn't be the definitive version of the brilliant Bram Stoker novel, but it is still a classic. My only complaints are the abrupt ending and David Manners as John, he tries his best but sometimes his line delivery is awkward and some of his lines are stilted.I did also think that to a lesser extent the first half is better than the second. The opening scene is absolutely brilliant, but while there are still some compelling and well-done scenes the second half is rather talky. That said, there is a lot I loved about Dracula. The costumes, sets, photography and lighting are suitably atmospheric and grandiose, the story is still the timeless story even with the many changes I love and the screenplay apart from the odd stilted line from John is very good.I saw Dracula in two versions, one without background music which added to the genuine atmosphere, and one with a suitably hypnotic and haunting score from minimalist composer Phillip Glass. While I loved Glass' score, I do prefer slightly the one without the scoring, the silence further added to the atmosphere I feel. The whole film is beautifully directed too, and while the film is very short at about an hour and a quarter the pace is just right.The acting is very good, perhaps theatrical in a way but I think it worked. Bela Lugosi has such a magnetic presence in the title role, Edward Van Sloan is perfect as Van Helsing but in a sinister and funny performance Dwight Frye steals the film.In conclusion, excellent film and a classic. 9/10 Bethany Cox", "While Tod Browning's Dracula is not the definitive take on the most famous vampire of all time, it is possibly the most memorable one. This is not due to Browning's technical achievements or directorial wizardry, by ANY means. It is due to Bela Lugosi's career-defining portrayal of the title character. Born in what is now Lugoj, Romania, Lugosi brings to the part the flavor of his homeland, making him more believable as Dracula. This other-worldly aesthetic helped to make his performance what many consider the ultimate incarnation of Stoker's Dracula. Having played the Count in Hamilton Deane's Broadway version of Dracula, which started in 1927, Bela Lugosi was more than prepared for the role when it was time to commit it to film. Still struggling with the English language, however, he had to learn his lines phonetically. European accent in tact, he was able to deliver such memorable lines as, \"I bid you welcome,\" \"Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make,\" and, of course, \"I am Dracula.\" His performance alone is reason enough to watch this monster movie classic. If only the rest of the film was as spectacular as Lugosi. Dwight Frye's Renfield, while perhaps a little too over-the-top, is still another highlight to the film, and even Edward Van Sloan's Van Helsing is enough to challenge the might of Count Dracula. The rest of the film is rather flat to me. Now, I know it was made in 1931, and that, at the time, it horrified audiences, but I still stand by my opinion that the overall movie pales in comparison to Bela Lugosi's performance. Everyone else just seemed to be going through the motions, and it seems especially evident while Helen Chandler and David Manners are on screen. They just aren't convincing. I'm not saying that their performances ruin the film. It is still a classic, and certainly worth a viewing, but if you are in the mood for a vampire movie that is worthy of Bram Stoker's name, look no further than F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. It is much more convincing and even scarier than Tod Browning's Dracula, despite being nine years older and silent. All in all, though, one cannot overlook the stellar performance of Bela Lugosi in the role he was born to play!", "One of the most iconic and popular characters in film history, Dracula has taken many forms, in many genres, and performed to various quality. Although not the first film to feature the character of Count Dracula (a couple of lost silent films and F.W. Murnau's unauthorised version Nosferatu came before), Bela Lugosi's portrayal of the menacing and seductive Count is commonly seen as the definitive.The story is known to most \u2013 solicitor Renfield (Dwight Frye) arrives at Count Dracula castle at night, despite prior warnings by the nearby locals. He is greeted by Dracula, who, unknown to Renfield, is a vampire. Upon arrival, he pricks his finger, causing it to bleed which visibly excites Dracula until he spies the crucifix hanging around Renfield's neck. Renfield is drugged by Dracula and the two travel to London the next day by boat. When the ship arrives, only Renfield remains on the boat, now seemingly a lunatic and a slave to the Count. He is hospitalised while Dracula becomes entranced by a woman named Mina (Helen Chandler), who is engaged to John Harker (David Manners). As circumstances grow stranger, Professor Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) becomes convinced that the Count is indeed a vampire, and that he must be destroyed.The film would be the beginning of a long run of successful horror movies made by Universal, which would be hits critically and commercially, and many are nowadays considered classics of the genre. Although falling short of the outright perfection of James Whale's Frankenstein (also 1931) and its sequel Bride Of Frankenstein (1935), Dracula still proves a great adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel. Lugosi's performance is the definitive Dracula, his minimal movements and slow, pronounced dialogue, spoken with his Hungarian accent proves an unnerving Count. I'm not forgetting Max Schrek's Nosferatu, while amazing for its sheer dedication, it was hardly the Dracula of the book.Director Tod Browning, who up to the point of making Dracula had made over 50 feature films, controls the film superbly, and opts for slow, menacing darkness rather than loud jump scenes and special effects. It builds up the mood gradually, and with Lugosi's fantastic central performance, makes for an atmospheric experience. It's a pity that Browning would almost end his career the next year with the commercially disastrous Freaks, which I consider a true great of the horror genre.It's just a shame that the film's final scene is rather soft and anti- climatic, jarring with the brilliance that came before. However, it remains an excellent film overall, and the film that would spawn many memorable films for Universal studious.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com", "The real estate agent Renfield (Dwight Frye) travels to Transilvania for a business meeting with Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), who is interested in Carfax Abbey in London. Renfield is converted in a servant of Dracula and prepares his master's ship travel to his new a property. While navigating, Dracula sucks the blood and kills all the crew of the vessel. Once in London, Dracula sucks the blood of Lucy Weston (Frances Dade) and she becomes an undead. He feels also a kind of passion for Mina Seward (Helen Chandler), the daughter of Dr. Jack Seward (Herbert Bunston) and fianc\u00e9 of Jonathan Harker (David Manners). Dracula sucks her blood, Mina has a weird behavior and health problem, and Dr. Seward calls a specialist, Prof. Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), to diagnose the mysterious problem with Mina. Although being a scientist, Van Helsing believes in the supernatural, and tries to save Mina from turning into a vampire.\"Dracula\" is a spectacular well-known classic vampire story, with a magnificent transposition of the Bram Stoker's novel to the cinema. Although being a 1931 black and white movie, the photography and the camera work are excellent. There are at least two magnificent scenes: the long traveling of the camera in the sanatorium, from the yard to Remfield's room and the long stairway in the end of the movie to Dracula's tomb. The performances are quite theatrical, as usual in that period, and the film does not show any explicit violent scene. I dare to say that probably it is Bela Lugosi's best performance. \"Universal Studios\" released in Brazil a wonderful box, with the shape of a coffin, called \"Classic Monster Collection\" with eight classic horror movies on DVD. Maybe \"Dracula\" is my favorite one. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Dr\u00e1cula\"Note: On 23 November 2013, I saw the Spanish Version of this movie.", "The 1931 `Dracula' casts an imposing shadow over the horror genre.  It is, after all, the movie that launched the classic Universal horror cycle of the 1930s and 1940s.  It is also a tremendous influence on the look and atmosphere of horror movies in general (and vampire movies in particular). It gave Dracula a look and a voice, and created a legend.Okay, so we know it was influential.  But how does it work as a movie? Well\u0085 the first time I watched it, I was underwhelmed.  The pace is slow. While Bela Lugosi's Dracula is menacing, the rest of the cast is colorless to the point of transparency.  There are some good gliding camera shots here and there (thank you, Karl Freund!), but the majority of the film is locked into stationary medium and long shots.  The film is tightly bound to its theatrical origins \u0096 director Browning has his characters look at things out of frame and describe them rather than just showing us, which would be much more effective.Fortunately, `Dracula' improves with repeated viewings.  The glacial pace and lack of sound in many places gives the movie a nightmarish sense of menace. In fact, `Dracula' is somewhere between a nightmare and a piece of classical music \u0096 everything proceeds at its own pace, gliding through the motions, gradually building suspense and momentum until the piece reaches climax.  The end result is a flawed but haunting, hypnotic masterpiece, and one of the greatest vampire films ever made.", "Tod Browning's film of the Stoker novel didn't so much eclipse Murnau's NOSFERATU (1922) as shove it into antiquity. One big reason was the technological advancement of sound. Roughly three years old by 1930, the public embraced the talking picture wholeheartedly over silents.The other big reason for Dracula's success was that the star of the stage play had been cast as the star of the film. And movie history was made. Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula is now a eighty-one year old icon, outlasting all other interpretations before or since. The twist is that this Dracula looks nothing like Stoker's creation (read the book). Lugosi, either through his work with the playwrights or later at Universal with Browning, devised the most insidious form the character would ever take- a handsome, courtly, well-groomed, civilized aristocrat, so gracious and attractive that he projected an aura of well-being over the viewer. This was worlds away from the Murnau/Max Schreck approach of head-on abomination in NOSFERATU.Sensibly, no one in their right mind would stay within viewing distance of Schreck (or Kinski in NOSFERATU, THE VAMPYRE and Dafoe in SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE) after the first glimpse. But Lugosi's Count would have you chatting and drinking wine- until he began to drink of you. That cape and those evening clothes are the perfect deception. Browning's Dracula is sometimes stagy and tentative in its continuity (it feels at times that the director was unsure where to go next in the progression of scenes). But Karl Freund's photography summons up a persistent mood of heavy gloom and enveloping dread.Two other assets in the film are Edward Van Sloan as Van Helsing and Dwight Frye as Renfield. Van Sloan was Universal's resident Learned Man, appearing as an Egyptologist in THE MUMMY (1933), and perhaps most famously as Dr. Waldman in FRANKENSTEIN (1931). A career-long character actor, Dwight Frye was an eccentric talent who appears to have worked exclusively at Universal. He had his best role as Renfield, producing a still blood-curdling, sneering laugh that seemed to come from the depths of a hellish insanity. If you haven't seen this Dracula please do so. The Count awaits.", "(62%) It is without doubt a classic owing to the fact that it is so well made, and so memorable. The sets are some of the greatest ever to appear on any film, and Lugosi is great as the awful head vamp. It's more than a little dated of course, so there's no blood/biting or on-screen death or murder, plus the acting is very theatrical at times, and there's quite a few long drawn-out sections of total silence that highlight exactly how old and pioneering it is.With that said, all horror fans should watch this at least once, as it does make a great late-night Halloween movie that will live on - just like the old count himself - forever.", "This movie has thrilled and chilled viewers for generations and also serves as a standard for vampire flicks. This is the role that Bela Lugosi was born to play, Count Dracula. His mannerisms and looks make the character masterful and commanding. Based on Bram Stoker's novel, a vampire terrorizes the English countryside searching for sustenance, human blood.Glorious black and white. The lighting, scenery and mood music should share equal billing with the great direction of Tod Browning. This movie leaves an impression that lasts a lifetime.Wonderful supporting cast includes: David Manners, Edward Van Sloan, Helen Chandler and Dwight Frye.", "This is the movie that set the horror genre into action.  Sure there may be a few campy scenes that look like they might be out of some high school play production (the rubber bats and armadillos in Dracula's castle come to mind), but there is an unmistakable suspense and eerieness about the film. If you are lucky enough to find the DVD reissue from 1999, you have three great versions: the original 1931 version with basically no background music, the 1999 rescoring of the movie by composer Philip Glass, and the extremely interesting Spanish version, made at the same time as the original (with totally different actors).  If you have this DVD, watch the movie twice: once with no soundtrack and once with the Glass rescoring.... totally different movie.  Glass' score is great, but it doesn't really help the movie at all (it actually hurts it in many cases).  But the utter silence in Browning's original just makes my skin crawl!  The acting is actually quite great (Lugosi is, of course, phenomenal as is Dwight Frye as Renfield).  The fear, the suspense, and, believe it or not, the sexuality, combines for a great movie that was an unbelievable success in its first release ($700,000 in it first US release, $1.2 million worldwide).  Not bad for a movie made 72 years ago!", "This incarnation of Dracula is quite a bit different from the previous Dracula (NOSFERATU). In the previous film, the names were changed in a cheesy attempt to get past copyrights, but Dracula (called \"Orlock\") was much as he was described in Tod Browning's novel--and probably back in 1922 was the scariest version of Dracula to date. This 1931 Dracula isn't nearly as viscerally scary--gone are the rats climbing about his feet, the excessively long and pointy fingernails and the bat-like face. In its place is a pretty sophisticated and cultured Bela Lugosi. While not exactly a \"sex symbol\", but by comparison to Orlock, he was quite the stud! Lugosi's performance, with its heavy Hungarian accent, is wonderful and measured. However, I think the biggest star of the film is the wonderful cinematography--with gauzy filters and a delicate touch when the action moves to Britain. A great horror film sure to please everyone.UPDATE: I just saw the restored version on TCM and was totally shocked at the cinematography. The film was simply gorgeous...one of the best films of the era simply from an artistic standpoint. So gorgeous that it really deserved a 10 (I had originally given it a 9).", "Time changes everything. Once upon a time Dracula, the stage play, was a sensation that starred BELA LUGOSI as the blood-thirsty man in the cape who thrilled theater audiences with his chilling portrayal. He's still chilling in the screen version Tod Browning directed and there's plenty of creepy atmosphere to keep you riveted to the story.But there are also plenty of faults. The opening scenes are a lot more cinematic than what follows once we leave the castle and the story starts dealing with Mina (HELEN CHANDLER) and Jonathan Harker (DAVID MANNERS) at their residence. It then becomes almost completely stagebound, with static movement of story and characters so that you know you're watching a museum piece from the '30s. The horror is so diluted by the stagey slow-talking dialog (sound was new and actors were told to keep their speeches slow so every word could be heard). It's an almost silent acting approach to the whole thing.BELA LUGOSI is very menacing in his huge close-ups but is guilty of stage acting all the way through. DWIGHT FRYE makes a very intense and enjoyable Renfield, although he too is guilty of extravagant overacting by today's standards.The cobweb atmosphere is dark and appropriately scary and the B&W lensing of the story is very impressive. But, as stated above, you have to take it for what it is--a primitive telling of the great story handicapped by its faithfulness to the stage version.It ends rather abruptly as Harker and Mina ascend the stairs and Van Helsing tells them he'll be along soon. Fadeout. The End. Much too abrupt. Modern audiences are bound to feel cheated by the less than thrilling ending.Summing up: Flaws and all, still an interesting experience mainly because Lugosi and Frye keep it watchable.", "Younger people who never saw the original here but have seen Dracula movies sometime in the past 30 years will be very disappointed with this original version. I'm not young, and I was disappointed, too, not that it was all bad.The film does have an eerie feel to it in a primitive way, so kudos for that. Bela Lugosi, the first and most famous Dracula of them all, has eyes that penetrate and are unforgettable. Unfortunately, that's about it as the only things unforgettable about this film.I said what I said in the first paragraph because there is no blood, not even one scene of Dracula biting anyone. Come on - this is Dracula!! The ending wasn't very dramatic, either: a most disappointing finish.I did enjoy watching this for the \"historical\" value, however, because having only known Dracula movies since the '50s I learned a few truths from this film. \"Truths,\" meaning that (1) Dracula had to return to the soil when he went to sleep at night, not particularly in a coffin, and Renfield was institutionalized when he arrived in America and stayed there until Dracula killed him in the end. You don't see these things in latter-day Dracula movies or in Dracula spoofs.", "Yes, after the \"first two reels\", this film is less effectively baroque, but it's still heartily enjoyable stuff, even if the finale is poorly handled. Bela Lugosi's performance as the good Count is so wonderfully definitive that it seems remarkable how many other actors have subsequently donned the cape. I've not seen any of the other versions, but I suspect few could match Lugosi's hypnotic display of acting. From the wonderfully eerie, sublimely photographed Transylvania scenes to the scenes in a London theatre, Lugosi is spellbinding. While he dominates the film, others make their mark. Helen Chandler is quite good as the unfortunate Mina Seward, Dwight Frye is wonderfully mad as Renfield and Edward Van Sloan is towering as Van Helsing. Certainly, there is a contrast in tone between the two parts of the film; the first nightmarish, eerie, mesmerising and very cinematic, the second more akin to a stage play, and rather more melodramatic, but it does come together in my view, as a most effective, likeable whole. It is all immensely helped by a quite wonderfully Philip Glass score, that perfectly complements and embellishes the images. In many ways it is typical Glass, and that is no bad thing, but the atmosphere the Kronos Quartet create is just right. Rating:- ****/*****.", "While the special effects,editing and sound really FEEL like they're over seventy-five years old,the movie itself still has a good,slow,eerie feel to it. I have yet to read Stoker's novel,but I'm quite familiar with the assortment of characters(the Count,VAn Helsing,Mina,JOhn/JOnathan HArker,Renfield,Lucy,Dr.Seward,the sanitarium staff,etc.) Probably more shocking when it was originally released(one story tells of a fainting at a screening of the film),director Tod Browning's movie would be considered quaint by most standards,it still holds up in imagery and in character,with Bela Lugosi able to inject plenty into mere glances and steadily,deliberate movement. The tale of the charismatic,mysterious nobleman from Transylvania who crashes ashore off a shipwrecked cargo vessel onto England,moving into an abandoned estate in sub-urban London's Carfax Abbey feels as common and comfortable as an old slipper. The acting isn't all that exceptional,save Lugosi,Dwight Frye(as the doomed,bug-eating lackey Renfield,whose back-story seems somewhat different than I recall from other versions of the story)and perhaps Edward Van Sloan(As the fiercely incorruptible Van Helsing),but that doesn't hinder this film's message or its mood. It works on a very basic premise,that being that this Dracula sort is one effective and lethal operator.I think that one who appreciates film legend and lore needs to take a look at this offering,for the sights and sounds are as true and necessary to the progression of film horror and melodrama as any from the \"Golden age of film\".", "After almost one hundred years of cinematic macabre nail and neck biting, Dracula still lives on, although his looks have changed enormously over those times. From the monstrous looking thin, bald creature in \"Nosferatu\" with the elf ears to the changing looks of Gary Oldman in Francis Ford Coppola's 1993 masterpiece (which Leslie Nielsen got to spoof in \"Dracula-Dead and Loving It\"), Dracula remains an undying un-dead character of fiction, even if there was a real life Vlad the Impaler who was the basis for Bram Stoker's novel of the legend of the vampire.Even with Oldman's unforgettable performance and other Draculas (such as Christopher Lee and Frank Langella), it is Bela Lugosi's performance as the count which remains the visionary for this creature of the night. Even though he lives in a Carpathian mountain castle loaded with cobwebs and strange looking rodents (one obviously an armadillo), he is definitely a creature of class, although his choice of beverage does not include wine and his nightlife, other than one visit to the opera upon his arrival in England, doesn't include going to the theater or ballet. He enjoys another dance, the dance of death, and other than one statement about how glorious it would be to be really dead, he is totally unapologetic of his lustful desire for human plasma.Has there ever been a more haunting carriage ride than Dwight Frye's journey through the Carpathian mountains? The mountain range looks absolutely desolate, in fact absolutely lifeless. It's obviously Lugosi driving the buggy, his eyes piercing in the dark without words as he picks Frye up from the fleeing carriage that is desperate to get out of the area. When Frye arrives at Dracula's castle, it becomes all the more eerie, with Lugosi's friendly greeting obviously plotting something more ominous as he declares, \"I bid you welcome!\". The presence of three obviously dead beauties is quite haunting, and it is obvious that Frye will not come out of this visit as he entered it. Even as Dracula changed looks over the years, his high-born nature never allows Dracula to be as crude as the monstrous creature of \"Nosferatu\". By not giving a backstory to the count's life, he remains a monster, yet one of noble birth, who is destined for evil and a gruesome demise.While the 1992 remake is certainly a superb romantic vision of the creature, this version makes no effort to romanticize him which gives Lugosi an element of mystery in his performance. He has a few scenes in dealing with the London characters he encounters in a social setting, but most of the time, he is brandishing his cape around to trap some unsuspecting victim in his web. The Mina of Helen Chandler is a sweet, rather stereotypical ing\u00e9nue with little to do other than look petrified as she falls under Dracula's spell. Lugosi is supported with an over-the-top but fun performances by Frye as the psychotic Renfield and Edward Van Sloan as the very determined Van Helsing. David Manners is rather bland as Jonathan Harker. The use of music from \"Swan Lake\" over the opening gives an eerie feeling. Appropriately slow moving in spots, it is almost opera like in the way it is presented. It is just too bad that when this became a Broadway musical, it was done so blandly that I had to refer to it as \"the most bring $100 I've ever spent in my life.\"", "Bela Lugosi couldn't have played it any better in Dracula. Simply said, scenes where we find ourselves looking into his eyes, we find ourselves fearfully looking into the eyes of death. Bela Lugosi also imposes a strong presence over his characters which I think is important to his image in Dracula. He is much taller than the other actors, which makes him look more powerful and makes his present felt. He is wonderfully scary. While it is obvious that it was made in 1931 during some scenes, it still strikes fear in the audience.The Mise-en-scene is incredible in this movie, particularly in the opening scene when the carriage comes speeding up the hill and quickly drops the man off to Dracula. There is a thick fog and darkness, Dracula wearing a black outfit covering everything, and cliffs in the background. Dracula's castle is also an excellent example of mise-en-scene with the darkness, high cathedral ceilings, spiderwebs everywhere, bats swooping about, and wolves howling in the background.", "I have had so much fun with this movie in my lifetime. From knowing virtually every line, to doing very bad impressions of the Bela Lugosi vampire. We all know him. The accent that is always used when we talk about Dracula. The parts of the movie I have learned to love start at the beginning. As Mr. Renfield travels through the ancient town at the foot of the Carpathians, the man with the huge mustache, when hearing of the young lawyer's plans, says with terror \"Drak-oo-la\"! Renfield has that puzzlement on his face. He can't understand the fears of the people. I love it when he leans out the carriage window and sees that bat (on the end of a string), flying before the horses. When he is finally dropped off at the Borgo Pass, the suitcases are flung to the ground. This guy should have got a clue, but he doesn't. Then, of course, there are the famous lines as he enters the castle. \"Listen to them, the children of the night.\" \"The spider spins his web to catch the unwary fly, eh, Mr. Renfield.\" That light is focused on Lugosi's eyes to make them stand out. From that point on, we have a wonderful presentation of atmosphere. The fog, the darkness, the suavity of the Count. There is a sexual undercurrent here that is really provocative. The subplot of Renfield at the asylum, eating the bugs (\"flies, flies, why should I eat flies when I could have nice fat juicy spiders). It is such a treat to watch the work of Tod Browning, using almost no soundtrack, still pulling us along. Then there is Professor Van Helsing, who is almost as unsettling as the vampire himself.This was Lugosi's shining hour. It's too bad Hollywood didn't meet him half way. Nevertheless, I feel so fortunate to have this delightful film to watch as often as I wish. It is such a part of our culture; everyone should see this and know why.", "\"Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make!\" so said Bela Lugosi in what was to be the role that cemented him as a pop culture icon of American film. To see director Todd Browning's original 1931 adaptation of Dracula is to see the American horror film at its finest. Dracula is the vampire formula at its purest before it could be diluted by the telling and the retelling. Dracula is a surreal experience as Browning takes us with him on a journey into our fear of death, but also our fear of the filthiness of sex. It is a film that has aged like a good wine which Bela Lugosi's Count Dracula swore to never drink.If one were to try and dissect Todd Browning's Dracula to find a sole element of success the search would lead us time and time again to Bela Lugosi. Dracula simply is not Dracula without Lugosi's portrayal of the Count. So much credit has to be given to Lugosi and his portrayal of the titular character. It is doubtful this film would have the staying power, or the atmosphere that it has if another actor was portraying Count Dracula. Lugosi's performance and how it succeeds is the marriage of so many factors, but arguably Lugosi's greatest asset to his performance would have to be his rich Hungarian accent. Lugosi surprisingly doesn't get much dialogue in the film as much of the exposition comes from the protagonist Professor Van Helsing played by Edward Van Sloan, and Dracula's slave Renfield played by Dwight Frye. The lines Lugosi does deliver are often extremely concise. It is not the lines themselves, but rather the way Lugosi delivers them that creates this character. How Lugosi delivers the lines offers more insight into this character than any detailed dissection of the character could. Lugosi's lines are read almost phonetically, each word one by one, each little nuance of the language stressed in Lugosi's thick Hungarian dialect. The resulting effect is hypnotic, poetic, frightening, and in many ways very sad. Lugosi's introduction is in my humble opinion one of the strongest scenes in motion picture history almost solely based on the delivery of the line \"I am... Dracula\". The scene follows Renfield, a solicitor whom Dracula will drive mad, as he ventures through Dracula's dilapidated castle searching for the Count. Dracula appears out of the shadows sucking in whatever air Renfield could muster in these catacombs of death by merely saying \"I am\u0085Dracula.\" Lugosi's delivery is as much a part of the aging castle trapped in time as the cobwebs are. Lugosi was so suave and mysterious as Dracula that the audience became attracted to the vampire.Dracula is not merely Lugosi's picture though. The film has a strong supporting cast highlighted by actor Edward Van Sloan, and Dwight Frye. One thing that can be said of Dracula's entire cast is that despite the extreme material no one even comes close to going over the top with their role. The amount of sincerity and the absence of any tongue in cheek aspect of performance are to be admired. Sloan and Frye's characters both had the potential to skate towards over the top territory, but both performances are firmly grounded in reality and are very effective in complimenting Lugosi's Dracula.Dwight Frye is very strong as Renfield. The role is as complex as that of the Count. Renfield is a bipolar madman enslaved to do Dracula's bidding. Frye is asked to exhibit behaviors on all forms of the spectrum. This character and the characterization are unpredictable to the extreme. One constant about Renfield is that he is the predator, and he represents the fear of sexuality within the vampire mythos. Frye's facial expressions are other worldly especially when we see the extent of Renfield's madness. There is a scene where Renfield crawls with vulture eyes towards a housemaid who has fainted by the sight of his very appearance. Frye too is asked to deliver insight into a character despite the fact that the lines don't explicitly offer character exposition or development. Renfield's dialogue mainly consists of nonsensical lunatic ravings. The way Frye delivers the lines and how he builds the intensity is really powerful though. It is these build up of the madness that keeps this character effective.Technically Dracula isn't all that impressive a picture from a cinematographer's standpoint, but does it really need to be? Browning is very cautious about what he wants to do with his camera. Much of the film is very static and offers little to no movement of the camera. What Browning captures in his shots though are really powerful images. The amount of attention given to the detail of each shot truly is amazing. The fact is there is not one shot of Bela Lugosi blinking in the entire film; that shows an incredible commitment. Browning is more of a still photographer than he is a cinematographer, but the power of the images is unmistakably there. This static dream-like world is perfect for the subject material.It may hurt the pacing a tad, but an argument can be made that the audience are much better able to appreciate Bela Lugosi, and even Dwight Frye's performance due to the way Browning stages his picture. Browning's appreciation for the hypnotic quality of images is one of the strengths of the film, not one of the weaknesses.Dracula is a masterpiece of film making. The film still offers a hypnotic experience almost 80 years after Bela Lugosi first uttered \"I am\u0085Dracula\". It is a film that has only gotten better with age. Todd Browning and Bela Lugosi succeeded in creating a surreal picture where vampires do exist.", "This movie might as well be called \"Bela Lugosi.\" Count Dracula was the part of a lifetime for Lugosi \u0096 one that both made him a star and destroyed his acting career. He ended up being helplessly and hopelessly typecast as a result of the absolutely brilliant performance he offered as the vampire count. The voice, the eyes, the presence \u0096 all Lugosi, all Dracula. From 1931 on, whenever anyone sees or hears Bela Lugosi (no matter what part he's playing) they see or hear Dracula, and \u0096 even now, over 75 years later \u0096 when someone does an imitation of Dracula, it's done in Lugosi's Hungarian accent. The typecasting is a shame, really \u0096 because Lugosi was a superb actor. I've seen him in several films and even in the later work of his career, when many of the movies he was in were less than stellar, Lugosi \u0096 when given a meaty enough role as opposed to a cameo \u0096 could make even a weak movie worth watching. And it basically all started with Dracula.The movie itself has some problems \u0096 foremost among them, because of the importance they play in the story \u0096 are the bat appearances. Bats don't fly like that, and they certainly can't hover! The ending struck me as rather abrupt, and I found myself thinking that there should have been more, and throughout the movie there are still examples of the transition in acting style required by the transition to \"talkies\" \u0096 especially what I consider to be deliberate over-acting, necessary in silent movies but sometimes distracting in \"talkies.\" Having said that, Lugosi even pulls that off well. His overly dramatic turning away from the wolfbane or cross and cowering behind his cape is in fact overly dramatic, and yet \u0096 it's also Dracula. That's just what Dracula does when confronted by wolfbane or a cross, because it's how Lugosi played the part, and coming from Lugosi it seems perfectly natural.The movie isn't especially frightening or suspenseful. Even for someone who had never seen it in 1931, real suspense is lacking. We find out very quickly that Count Dracula is a vampire \u0096 just a few minutes in Lugosi pops out of a coffin. The sets are very good though \u0096 creating a sense of mystery and fear, even if there's nothing overly frightening about this. Whatever the strengths or weaknesses of the story, though, the movie is made by the performances \u0096 Lugosi's obviously, but also Dwight Frye as his hapless victim Renfield, who becomes enamoured of eating flies and spiders and rats as a result of being turned into Dracula's slave. His performance is actually quite funny, and one thing lacking in the movie is any explanation of what happened to Renfield. After Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) \"dispatches\" Dracula does Renfield return to normal, as Mina (Helen Chandler) did, or does he spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum? That was a loose end that wasn't tied up.I've never read Bram Stoker's original novel, so can't comment on how this movie relates to Stoker's work, but I have seen many film versions of Dracula, and this is by far the classic version. Many other actors have played the evil count, but none have pulled it off as perfectly as Bela Lugosi. 8/10."], "tt0021815": ["Spanish-language version of Dracula filmed at the same time as the English-language version. While Tod Browning directed that one during the day, George Melford would direct this one at night using the same script and sets. Many consider this to be the superior version of the two, at least from a directing perspective. This film has a more polished look in most scenes than its English-language counterpart. The direction isn't as stiff or stagey as it often is with Tod Browning's Dracula. To be fair, however, director George Melford had the benefit of watching Browning's footage so he had a template with which to work and improve upon. This version is also longer by almost half an hour. There are no added scenes but each scene plays out longer with added dialogue. Often it's just a case of an extra shot or two per scene, with Melford taking his time and building tension. The added length is good and bad . Good because it allows for scenes to play out properly without feeling rushed, as sometimes was the case with Browning's film. Bad because the added time is mostly added dialogue, which makes the long stretches with little action seem interminable. There are also more sound effects in this one as well as bits of music. It helps things considerably, especially in the creepy castle scenes.The ultimate shortcoming with the Spanish version of Dracula is the cast, particularly the lead actor. Bela Lugosi, for all his hamminess, was an undeniably menacing presence in his film. Comical-looking Carlos Villar\u00edas seems a poor imitation, with his constant crazy eyes and goofy smile. It's hard to take him seriously, let alone find him a threatening or alluring character. Pablo \u00c1lvarez Rubio is good and probably a better actor than Dwight Frye, but somehow his Renfield is less memorable in comparison to Frye's over-the-top performance. Eduardo Arozamena is decent as Van Helsing but he lacks Edward Van Sloan's screen presence. The guy looks like Eugene Levy! The only solid improvements in the cast are in the romantic pair of Juan and Eva (John and Mina in the other). Barry Norton is a more grounded actor than the theatrically-inclined David Manners. Lupita Tovar is much sexier and livelier than Helen Chandler's pallid Mina.It's certainly a great movie and not just a curio. Stronger in some ways than Browning's Dracula but weaker in others. I would say they're both about even, with a slight edge to the Browning version simply because of the iconic performances of Lugosi, Van Sloan, and Frye.", "Language was no barrier to Hollywood in the silent era: title cards were easily translated from English. When sound began to roar, Hollywood began to fear the loss of its foreign markets--and so, for a brief time, the studios occasionally produced two versions of certain films, one in English and one in another language, most often German or Spanish. Such was the case with the 1931 Dracula.According to film historian and author David J. Skal, producer Paul Kohner fell in love with Mexican-born actress Lupita Tovar (they later married), and his romantic interest prompted the suggestion that she star in a Spanish-language version of the film. When the English language cast wrapped for the day, the Spanish language cast arrived and worked through the night using the same sets.Most of Hollywood's foreign-language duplicates were forgotten as quickly as they were released, but the Spanish Dracula would be the exception. Todd Browning, who directed the English language film starring Bela Lugosi, was extremely uncomfortable with sound technology. While the first fifteen minutes or so his film are exceptional, the movie thereafter becomes a filmed stage play--and a very choppy and rather unimaginative stage play at that. Instead of simply duplicating Browning's set-ups, producer Kohner and director George Melford set out to best him, and when the Spanish version debuted most viewers declared it greatly superior to the English version.And in many respects it is. Whereas Browning's version is visually flat and rather slow, the Spanish Dracula is visually exciting, and although it is considerably longer than the English version the pace never drags. It also has it all over the Browning version in terms of editing, and it has a cohesion the Browning version completely lacks. The supporting cast is also quite fine, with Lupita Tovar a standout, easily besting Helen Chandler's remarkably tiresome performance in the English version.But the Spanish Dracula has a problem, and it's a big one: actor Carlos Villarias, billed here as Carlos Villar. Villarias had a respectable film career throughout the 1930s and 1940s, but he met his match in Dracula; where Lugosi intoned, snarled, and endowed the vampire with an elegant evil, Villarias goes through the film with a series of expressions that lead one to believe he has just encountered an overflowing toilet. His flaring nostrils and disgusted glances are so incredibly out of place that they quickly become unintentionally hilarious.Lugosi's performance, of course, is generally considered the ultimate statement of the role, and with good reason. In a perfect world, we would be able to snatch Villarias out of the Spanish Dracula and insert Lugosi in his place; the result would be a truly amazing film from start to finish. As it is, however, we are stuck with Villarias, and frankly he bites.The VHS release of the Spanish Dracula is out of print, but the film is available on the same disk with the Universal release of the more widely known Todd Browning version. By and large the film quality is remarkably good; it has not, however, received a digital remaster, and at least one of the reels would greatly benefit from it. If you are a fan of 1930s horror, you'll find it more than worth the effort, but I suspect more casual viewers will be reduced to hysterical laughter by the Villarias performance.GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "The Browning/Lugosi 'classic' has always been one of my favorite Universal horror films but, ever since the simultaneously-produced 'rival' Spanish version resurfaced, the 'original' has taken a beating by fans and historians alike - mainly because the latter features superior camera-work! This, however, is the ONLY area where it can lay a claim to be better in when compared to the US version (the fact that leading lady Lupita Tovar had a sexier wardrobe than Helen Chandler shouldn't even be considered, I guess). Still, the fact that on the DVD the opinion that the seminal US version is the inferior one seems to be shared by quite a few people hasn't done it any favors! I remember being impressed by the Spanish version when I first watched it in 2001, singling out for praise the performance of Pablo Alvarez Rubio as Renfield and, of course, George Robinson's cinematography. However, coming back to it now, I felt that Rubio's hysterical rendering of the character (which reminded me of Gene Wilder in YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN [1974] of all people!) was nowhere nearly as nuanced as Dwight Frye's unforgettable characterization in the US version. Regarding the \"superior camera-work\", I guess this is true for individual sequences (Dracula's introduction, for instance) but, frankly, I never felt that Karl Freund - a pioneer of the moving camera - had somehow been restrained by Tod Browning, who admittedly wasn't very fond of this technique. Given that of late we've also been faced by the ridiculous assumption that Browning didn't actually direct the film, he couldn't have - since he wasn't even there!! It may be however, that since frequent Browning collaborator Lon Chaney (who had been slated for the title role) died before shooting began, the director sort of lost heart in the project - coupled also with the fact that the script was rather talky, another element with which Browning felt uneasy! Well, whatever went on behind the scenes, for me what's in front remains one of the highlights of the American horror film - from the marvelous dialogue (especially as delivered - each in their own unique way - by Lugosi, Frye and Edward Van Sloan), irreproachable performances (Frye and Van Sloan were at their best, while Lugosi only ever really came close with THE BLACK CAT [1934] and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN [1939]) and memorable individual scenes (the entire first act set in Transylvania, the confrontation scenes between Dracula and his nemesis Professor Van Helsing, Renfield's various ravings). The tame ending may appear anti-climactic to most people but I honestly was never bothered by it! If anything, this was remedied in any number of ways in subsequent outings...Which brings us back to the Spanish Dracula: like I said, the film is an interesting and altogether pleasing 'alternate' to the Lugosi version...but it is fatally compromised by the inadequate leading performance of Carlos Villarias, whose bulging eyes and feral snarls can't hold a candle to Lugosi's definitive screen vampire! This version does go to places where the American doesn't (Browning shies away from the vampire attacks, for instance) and even features 'new' scenes like the aftermath of the vampiric Lucy's demise - but, at 104 minutes (a full half-hour longer than the US version, when considering that they were following the same script!) it's way overlong for its own good. The Browning/Lugosi version is often criticized for its sluggishness but this one actually moves at a snail's pace: take, for instance, the famous scene where Dracula is exposed by the mirror - Lugosi knocks the box down immediately, while Villarias takes forever to do so (even if his resolution is effectively flamboyant nonetheless).A word about the DVD quality: disappointingly, the Spanish version features closed-captions (for the hearing-impaired) rather than proper subtitles. As for the US version, the print utilized for this particular transfer (which differs from that of the original, and more satisfactory, 1999 release) is a bit too dark for my taste and the dialogue sometimes was hard to catch due to the incessant hiss on the soundtrack! It also reverts to the 'original' single groan during Dracula's staking (instead of the elongated variant available on the earlier disc)...but does feature a bit of music at the end of the Opera sequence, which had been missing from the previous edition!! Well, this only means that it's worth keeping both copies of Dracula as neither is really definitive...", "If my facts are straight, this much touted Spanish version of \"Dracula\" was considered lost for many years until its rediscovery in the 1970s--upon which many a critic and film historian flocked to view this rare \"gem\" & seemingly all at once proclaimed it better than its more famous English cousin.Perhaps the novelty of finding this similar, but in many aspects different alternate take on the Tod Browning classic led to such clamoring, though given the many years in which viewers have been accustomed to videotape & now DVD--in which a back-to-back comparison of the two films is a very simple exercise--the fawning many do over Melford's 'Drac' seems a bit in the extreme, particularly such critical observations of how Melford upstages the English film \"scene by scene, shot by shot\". Having recently viewed both films, it's my opinion that a shot-for-shot comparison doesn't prove very detrimental at all to Se\u00f1or Browning.For instance, the much raved about moving camera of George Robinson doesn't really show much more mobility than Karl Freund's. Yes, there is the shot of the camera roving up the stairs in Drac's castle, but aside from that & a few other minor instances, Melford & Robinson keep the camera as still as the oft-derided Browning. Btw, I found it more than a bit amusing that the critters Browning has roaming around the cellars of Dracula's castle--the opossum and bug escaping from a miniature coffin--were retained by Melford.The really big difference in movies is seeing the different angles which Melford shot many of his scenes from & how he makes more use of the outside portico in many of the later drawing room scenes. For those of us familiar with the Lugosi film, this can make for an interesting visual variety, but does this really equate to \"better\" or \"masterful\" directing?It's not my intention to slam this version of Dracula. I think any horror fan should give it a few looks to see how two different production teams can interpret a single script & put their own creative twists on it. From that standpoint, the Spanish \"Dracula\" is required viewing, but hardly the \"scathing critique\" of its English counterpart that many have proclaimed it to be.", "Back in the early 1930s, studios hadn't perfected dubbing and felt audiences no longer wanted subtitles or intertitle cards, as the silent era had just past. So, little known to audiences today, the American studios often re-filmed the exact same film using the same sets and sometimes even the same directors and often this was done at night when the American cast went home. However, Laurel and Hardy even learned to phonetically pronounce scripts in French, Spanish, German and Italian because they already had a huge international audience.Here, with Dracula, the studio made two versions as well--English (with Bela Lugosi) and the Spanish language one with Carlos Villar\u00edas. Interestingly, Universal Studios chose to make multiple versions of Dracula but not of FRANKENSTEIN and you could probably assume that they thought Dracula would be the more successful film. But, because Lugosi was not internationally adored and well-known, there was no need to use him or the American cast. Instead, an American director (using a translator) filmed the Spanish version using a cast from all parts of the Spanish-speaking world.Like the Laurel and Hardy films, this version was actually longer than the American version in order to fit the format generally used in these Hispanic countries. As a result, some new scenes were added and some minor characters were given more screen time. In particular, Renfield is given LOTS more time--and he's much more interesting here than in the American version. However, for the most part, the films look about the same and frankly I think both are equally good. As for Villar\u00edas, he's not exactly Bela Lugosi, but he's still very good. I particularly loved his wider emotional range--with a slightly more animated performance.So, if you are a lover of classic horror films, give this one a shot. It's well made and you'll be surprised how alike the two versions are in quality.", "It is hard to say which is the better version of the Todd Browning version and this, both have flaws but both has many things to recommend. There are things here that are done better here than in Browning's, like some of the storytelling and how it was made, but Browning's had the better Eva/Mina, Van Helsing and especially Dracula(the Renfield interpretations personally rank the same).Visually this version is an absolute treat, the cinematography is superb and the editing is much improved over Browning's version as is George Melford's exciting direction over Browning's, the sets are wonderfully Gothic too, especially the genuinely creepy Trasylvanian castle. Of individual scenes the standouts were the smoke with Dracula rising out of his coffin, Renfield and the fly and the terrific final shot. The eerie music score compliments the atmosphere beautifully and the dialogue flows reasonably well.The storytelling is very compelling on the whole, as well as those three standout scenes the relationship between Eva and Seward is incredibly affecting, the atmosphere is very spooky, there is an exciting climax and it does make more sense than Browning's with things better explained thanks to the stronger editing. It is not perfect this said, the film is overlong and does drag as a result as expanding on these loose ends, the first scene with Dracula is scarier in the Browning film. The acting is a mixed bag, with the strongest performances being Lupita Tovar as a lively Eva, Jos\u00e9 Soriano Viosca's sympathetic Seward and particularly the chillingly insane Renfield of Pablo \u00c1lvarez Rubio. Eduardo Arozamena plays Van Helsing more than reliably if not as memorable as Edward Van Sloan or Peter Cushing. Barry Norton however is very stiff as Juan and Carlos Villarias tries far too hard as Dracula, his facial expressions verging on cartoonish and he lacks the aristocratic charisma and suave menace that Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee had.All in all, a worthy version but a long way from perfect. A very high 7/10 Bethany Cox", "Shot the same time as the English version of Dracula, this Spanish version was shot on the same sets during the night.  Some people consider this superior to the English version.  In SOME ways it is.The English version was badly directed by Tod Browning...but it was Browning's first sound film.  His direction (which was great in the silents) suffers from having to have the actors speak into concealed microphones. Also the camera seems rooted to the spot.  The Spanish version however was exceptionally well-directed.  The camera moves and the director seems very at ease with using sound.  Also the first appearance of Dracula in the English version was badly handled--in the Spanish one it's actually very good and a little frightening!  Also we find out the fate of Lucia (Lucy) in this one.  And the plots with Renfield and Eva (Mina) are more fleshed out . And Pablo Alvarez Rubio gives a good performance as Reinfield.  AND the girls wear more revealing nightgowns:) But that's about it.This film is VERY slow (it runs 25 minutes longer than the other) and the acting isn't that good.  The man playing van Helsing overacts (badly) and Barry Norton and Lupita Tovar are just OK as Eva and Juan.  But Carlos Villatias is all wrong as Dracula.  He tries but he can't carry the role. His villainous looks are actually rather silly and he totally lacks the screen presence of Lugosi.  If that had teamed this director with the English cast there might have been a GREAT movie.  But, unfortunately, it didn't happen.  I do give this a 7 though.", "This alternate 1931 Spanish language version of the familiar Transylvanians' story was shot throughout the night, using the same Universal sets that the American production utilized during the day. Some buffs consider it superior, at least in a technical sense, but for this viewer, it was at least comparable to the Lugosi classic. Not really scary, per se, but atmospheric, literate, and fun.The Count, played with a rather goofy charm by Carlos Villarias, comes to London to rent Carfax Abbey, and works his spell on local beauties such as Eva (Lupita Tovar) and Lucia (Carmen Guerrero). Those brave souls willing to fight him are asylum administrator Dr. Seward (Jose Soriano Viosca), Evas' handsome suitor \"Juan\" Harker (Barry Norton), and the determined, knowledgeable vampire hunter Van Helsing (Eduardo Arozamena).Running approximately a half hour longer than the Lugosi / Tod Browning version, this is admittedly rather plodding, and thus not to all horror fans' tastes. For a while, it consists of more talk than action. But the characters, and performances, are entertaining, with Arozamena frequently mugging for the camera, Villarias keeping that silly smile on his face, and the majority of the cast playing it quite straight. Pablo Alvarez Rubio is wonderful as the nutty, bug munching Renfield; Dwight Frye may be more iconic in the role, but Rubios' performance is no less amusing. Some people will appreciate the attire of the ladies in this version, which is decidedly sexier.An effectively roving camera operated by George Robinson is certainly an asset, with credited director George Melford and company making full use out of the existing sets.Two years later, leading lady Tovar (who only recently passed away, at the impressive age of 106) married associate producer Paul Kohner.Seven out of 10.", "It took me over 30 years to finally compare the Spanish language version off Dracula to the more familiar one starring Bela Lugosi. This one is surprisingly much longer. Very well made, using the same Universal sets, with a good cast but Lugosi plays a much better Count in my opinion.", "The most interesting thing about the Spanish version of Dracula is the modest & informative introduction of main actress Lupita Tovar. I don't know when exactly this brief interview with her was shot, but it can't be too long ago judging by the picture quality, which makes it all the more impressive that she still looks relatively good! According to the IMDb, she's still alive and kicking, though nearly reaching the age of 100 and not having made any movies in more than 60 years. With great pride, Tovar explains how the Spanish crew exclusively worked during the nights, using the exact same sets of the English version, how the director didn't understood the language of his cast & crew and \u0096 most notably \u0096 how her costumes and wardrobes were a lot sexier and more revealing than those of her English speaking colleagues. Interesting! She also claims that the Spanish version is superior and that is, of course, debatable since many of the plot lines seem unnecessarily stretched and on the verge of being very tedious. The story is exactly the same, but this version pays more attention to the extended drawing of characters that are merely supportive, like Renfield for example. The film eventually runs half an hour longer than its English counterpart, 104 minutes in total, and that is simply too long for a horror movie of that era. Part of the Universal monster movies' charm is that they are short, straightforward and to the point. \"Dr\u00e1cula\" is the first, and to my knowledge, only contemporary Universal movie that features needless padding. Naturally Carlos Villarias is no patch on Bela Lugosi when it comes to depicting the legendary infamous Count. Lugosi literally owned the character; whereas Villarias is hardly menacing at all and most of the time he appears to pull funny grimaces and sneering expressions. There are so numberless versions of Bram Stoker's immortal novel available on the market, so I'm not entirely sure why Universal didn't simply dub the American version instead of producing yet another different film, but it still has many fans. And it made Mrs. Lupita Tovar proud to be an actress, which is a good thing as well, I guess.", "Unusual film in that it is a Spanish language version of the Bela Lugosi film, made at the same time and on the same sets as the 1931 film, only with an entirely different cast and crew. Actually, it was directed at night, while Tod Browning made his during the day. Plot is exactly the same, though differently staged, and in some ways is an improvement, being more atmospheric and effective, even though it is nearly 30 minutes longer! What's missing is a lead actor with the talent of Bela Lugosi, and that's a big deal. Universal Studios apparently did it this way once, and resorted to dubbing in the future, which would certainly be simpler...", "Copyright 1931 by Universal Pictures Corporation. Madrid premiere: 20 March 1931. Mexico City opening: 4 April 1931. General release in Spain: 28 May 1931. 104 minutes.COMMENT: Lupita Tovar comments in her introduction to Universal's DVD release that everyone involved in this movie didn't just want to make a Spanish-language version of Dracula, they wanted to make a better version. Believe it or not, in this aim they have admirably succeeded. Although filmed on exactly the same sets, this film runs a whole half-hour longer. Some scenes are actually shorter (the shipboard sequence) and one or two have been eliminated (the flower seller), but most run for greater length with absolutely no loss of tension at all. Instead they all generate a powerful increase in audience suspense and involvement.This is due to the combined efforts of imaginative scripting (what a masterstroke are the creaking doors in Dracula's castle!), engrossing acting (I thought Villarias far more menacing than the stagy Lugosi who is forced to rely on artificial devices like make-up and lighting to supplement his appropriately oily voice), stylish direction (Browning's compositions often seem amateurish by comparison) and superlatively noirish photography which strikes exactly the right balance between moody atmospherics and the audience's need to see what's going on (I found Freund's photography often a bit too dark-at least in the current DVD release).So far as the other players are concerned, I thought the lovely Lupita Tovar an equal match for Helen Chandler, that Arozamena filled Van Sloan's shoes more than adequately, and that the rest of the players led by Pablo Alvarez Rubio (as the demented Renfield) and Barry Norton (as our heroine's fianc\u00e9) were far and away superior to their counterparts in the Browning version.AVAILABLE on DVD through Universal. Quality rating: Ten out of ten.", "Let's get real: there are only two reasons the reputation of the original Dracula has remained intact into the 21st Century - Bela Lugosi's performance and as a monument to camp/nostalgia of a certain kind. In all other respects, it is at its best competent, in its worst moments dreadful. While admittedly atmospherically moody in design, it is ridiculously slow, and, with the exception of Lugosi, the acting is hilariously bad. Does Lugosi's strangely ethereal, other-worldly performance save the show. Yes; on the other hand, goth-nostalgia grows ever more wearisome as the years wear on.Despite a legend perpetrated by Universal Studios itself, that the Spanish language version of the film produced simultaneously with the original was shot by shot the same with different actors, the Spanish Dracula is a completely different interpretation of the same script. The lighting is better, the camera work more fluid and more professionally handled, the editing is far more advanced - indeed the look of the film would put it in the early '40s if we didn't know better. Adding to this impression of being ahead of its time is the acting - naturalistic, emotive, performed by a cast with a considerable repertoire of facial expressions and vocal intonations at their disposal, most utterly believable.Finally, there is the redefinition of just what the 'horror' of Dracula really amounts to. Lugosi's presence in the original is heightened by the portrayal of a British middle class environment that is hopelessly banal. Here, the environment is given a warmer glow, but the real horror of the vampire is that he is a beast in aristocratic disguise, seething with barely suppressed violence. Pay special attention to the ship voyage sequence: in the original this is mostly about a storm in which Lugosi stands literally unmoved by the rough waves battering the ship. In the Spanish version, the sequence is about the direct confrontation between the Count - hungry, gloating sneer on his face, crouched, about to pounce - and the unbelieving sailors, with a soundtrack provided by a truly frightening screech of laughter from the mad Renfield.A note must also be made concerning the sexuality of the two films. The implicit sexuality of the original is really largely legend, derived almost solely from Lugosi's own impressively suave charisma. The makers of the Spanish version have not left the matter to the chance of casting - the women are thinly dressed, and Dracula's approach to them openly seductive - this especially becomes clear in one scene where Dracula steps between the heroine and her fianc\u00e9, utterly ignores the fianc\u00e9's presence and speaks to the heroine in the soothing, caring tones of a lover! I'm not saying the Spanish Dracula is anything more than a well made B-movie - but it is an exceptionally well made B-movie, probably the best of its era - a real classic that stands the test of time on the virtue of its rugged performance and professional polish.Give honor to Lugosi's historic performance - but pay homage to a nearly lost masterwork of genre cinema, the Spanish language Dracula, 1931.", "Although filming took place on the same studio lot as the English speaking version, the Spanish speaking version offers several intriguing opportunities to view different or expanded views of the outdoor and indoor scenery. The Spanish version clearly boasts a more comprehensive cinematography. Moreover, ominous creaking doors are louder, and the unearthly baying of the \"children of the night\" (wolves) definitely have a more distinctive creepiness to them. The Spanish Dracula is worth watching on several levels, and English subtitles are available on most of the recent Universal DVD releases.", "The Spanish-language version of Bram Stoker's novel was filmed at night on the same sets as its Lugosi-starred American counterpart, with what looks like Universal's unit for Spanish-language comedy shorts.  We get to see what looks like the Mexican versions of Mabel Normand, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd go through the vampiric rituals.  Contrary to rumour, it is certainly inferior in acting, tone, and pacing to Tod Browning's version. The Browning version may have less plot (probably Universal's editors had instructions to cut length to allow for extra showings and to cut out the dead weight of Browning's lethargic pace, which worked with silent gothics but not so well with sound), but its got much better actors putting in much better performances.  Medford's film may be a better directed film than Browning's \"Dracula\" in terms of modern film tastes, but so is your average \"Francis the Talking Horse\" movie,  and they're not true classics either. Browning's \"Dracula\" is, irrefutably, a classic.  That's my two cents on the supposed controversy over which version is better (I guess I disagree with most of the posters on imdb), which to me is as obvious as it could possibly be.The nice gothic set pieces distinguish this film from other cheapie horror films, but these are entirely borrowed from the English language production. Interestingly, no actual graverobbing is shown in this safe-for-Catholics version of Dracula.", "There are those who reckon that this version of Dracula, made for a Latin-American audience with a Spanish speaking cast at the same time and on the same sets as the Lugosi film, is superior to its better known relation. Personally, I reckon that those people must've been overdoing it on the Sangria: not only does the Spanish Dracula suffer from the same weaknesses as Tod Browning's classic\u2014stagy performances, uninspired direction, and laughable rubber bats\u2014but it stretches them out over a mind-numbing 104 minutes, making it all the more dreary.Carlos Villar\u00edas is merely adequate as 'Conde Dr\u00e1cula', his evil stares and awkward mannerisms a pale imitation of Se\u00f1or Lugosi, whilst Pablo \u00c1lvarez Rubio as Renfield takes overacting to a whole new level, his maniacal performance not nearly as effective as that of Dwight Frye, who played his English speaking counterpart. Thankfully, the ladies fare much better, with Lupita Tovar as Eva Seward and tasty Carmen Guerrero as Luc\u00eda Weston giving performances that easily outshine those given by Helen Chandler and Frances Dade in Browning's version (it doesn't hurt that the lovely Ms Tovar almost falls out of her dress towards the end either).As the film progresses (very slowly) to the inevitable Van Helsing/Dracula showdown, events unfold in a manner almost identical to the Lugosi film, albeit with a little more exposition; the result is a movie so dull and drawn out that I was tempted to opt for an early siesta rather than persevere to the end (I am, however, a seasoned pro at watching crap films and only pulled down my sombrero for a kip once the film had finished).4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb.", "Dracula, in Spanish.I saw this version several years ago thanks to a local film festival.  They had recently reconstructed a copy and were about to re-release it.In a wonderfully cost-effective move this was filmed, using the same sets and the same script as the famous Bela Lugosi version. Swing-shift filmmaking.Even though my Spanish is very weak, I know the original.  And hearing \"I never drink... wine\" or \"The children of the night! What beautiful music they make!\" is still chilling no matter what language.And the director of this version made different choices from the Lugosi version. One scene that was particularly effective: Dracula walking through a mass of spider-webs without disturbing them.Eight stars.  See it if you can.", "Whilst Universal films toiled during the days, Director George Melford and his team of Spanish film-makers worked through the nights using the same sets and adapting their own version of the story via the 1924 stage version.It is irresistible to compare this version with the Bela Lugosi-headed version, but I'll also try to review this film in its own right. Spanish Dracula is played by Carlos Villarias, the only member of the crew allowed to see the rushes of the Universal rushes so he could imitate Lugosi's mannerisms. This might do Villarias a disservice \u2013 there could only ever be one Lugosi performance, which is a very singular, much-copied affair that caused such a sensation that he was cursed (or blessed) to play horror characters for most of his career. Villarias could be seen as a tribute act \u2013 lots of grimacing and lizard-like movements, but little of the presence. He succeeds over Lugosi during the second half, where The Count is required to mingle with high society. Whereas Lugosi's mannerisms were so extreme, the polite responses around him were rendered ridiculous, the Spanish Conde makes some effort to ingratiate himself with the company. Villarias should not be criticised for not being Lugosi in my view, and he is perfectly fine in the role.Pablo Alvarez Rubio's Renfield is possibly more manic than was Dwight Frye's (but lacks the subtle fragility), and it is reassuring to know that Renfield's warden, Martin (Manuel Arb\u00f3), behaves just as inappropriately as his 'cockney' counterpart. Of course, it is difficult to appreciate the performances fully as I cannot speak Spanish, but it seems also that Eduardo Arozamena as Van Helsing, whilst authoritative, is not as stuffy as Edward Van Sloan's fastidious version. Kudos to Barry Norton for at least turning up to play the unrewarding and forgettable role of Juan Harker.The biggest contrast might well be the character of the main female victim. Helen Chandler's character Mina is a fragile, delicate creature \u2013 Lupita Tovar's Eva is more full-blooded, more sensual. Both versions of this character are excellent to my mind (Tovar died in 2016 aged 106).Whereas Melford's version doesn't quite measure up to the saturation levels of spooky atmosphere the American version displayed, it enjoys a far more watchable second half. The Direction is more assured, more filmic and less like a stage play. Villarias' first meeting with Renfield, after several lingering distant shots earlier on, is quite spectacular. The camera leaps from Renfield's viewpoint and rapidly tracks up the huge staircase to find El Conde perched and waiting, just in front of an equally impressive spider's web. The Castle remains a tremendous set, and is explored beautifully by Melford's camera, its huge scale revealed by some terrific camera angles. Even Dracula's rising from the coffin is handled imaginatively: always an awkward moment (we never see Dracula's undignified stepping out), here he merely rises from behind the open casket, framed by billowing smoke (clearly standing behind the coffin, not in it), as the lid slowly closes. Also, the welcome inclusion of the 'woman in white' is brief, but chilling.Is this 'better' than Tod Browning's version? Who cares? It is stagey, talky and brilliant. That's all the matters.", "Super interesting to compare this with the 1931 English language classic.It's not as good in my opinion, but it takes its time to explain more (sometimes holding the viewers hand) and has a few great effects shots that are superior to the English counterpart.\nBest of all though is the Reinfield/fly joke that completely slays (and they so unfortunately cut out of the English version.) That alone is worth the price of admission.", "Much has been made of the Spanish-language version of the Universal horror classic Dracula, shot on the same sets and at the same time but with a completely different Hispanic cast. While the Universal film was shot in the mornings, this Spanish version was made in the afternoons, with the director apparently doing his best to improve on the Lugosi film. A lot of people think he did, but I'm not one of them.I found the Spanish Dracula to be long-winded and slightly boring. Many of the best things about it, such as the set design and the associated atmospherics, are simply there as a result of the English-language version. This film's about half an hour longer, but the extra running time is made up of long, drawn-out conversations that were handled more snappily in the Lugosi version. In addition, the cast members are largely unconvincing, with Carlos Villarias particularly hammy as the Count and not a patch on the sinister Lugosi. Don't get me started on the guy playing Renfield, either.", "First things first. I give full credit to Director Melford and his cast and crew for the effort. They could easily have just 'mailed this in' and did a quickie shot for shot alternate version - but, they clearly didn't. They not only gave it their all, but, they put their own emphasis and spin on the proceedings.Second, no, this isn't a 'better' version as many revisionists would have it. Sure, some of the camera movement is refreshing compared to the largely static Browning edition. And, it's good to see a fuller edit of the original screenplay/play adaptation (a 29 minute additional runtime!). But, the Lugosi version is better if for no other reason than.........LUGOSI! Carlos Villarias had a decent career in Mexican cinema, but, there's a reason that Lugosi, limited as he was in certain ways, is still a legend. You can't teach charisma. Bela had it, Carlos didn't. More importanly, much of that extra screentime is given over to long-winded explanations, slow line readings and the actors staring at one another. If one were to ruthlessly take a stopwatch to it, I doubt there is more than 10 to 15 minutes of truly 'new' material.Other than Villarias (and, the stolid Eduardo Arozamena as Van Helsing), the Spanish cast holds up reasonably well. Pablo \u00c1lvarez Rubio may not quite equal Dwight Frye as Renfield, but, it's a more than worthy alternate performance. The actresses give their roles a bit more vigor than their English speaking counterparts. Melford's Direction is good, but, he does have a pacing problem. The Browning version is much better edited than the Spanish version. Much.All in all, 'Spanish' DRACULA is a worthy restoration. It would have been a shame had it disintigrated into history. But, the revisionists have it wrong. The Browning-Lugosi is still the definitive version of the count from that era.", "This Spanish version of DRACULA is interesting and odd, running nearly a half-hour longer than the English version with Lugosi. It was filmed by Universal simultaniously with the Lugosi version, using the same sets but with a Spanish-speaking cast. The Lugosi version was filmed during the day, and the Spanish version was filmed at night.Carlos Villarias is excellent as Dracula. There is more use of sound effects in this version, with doors creaking and other moody sounds along the way that are not in the English version. Also, the costumes for the women are more revealing.Lugosi still has the upper fang as far as being ominous, especially with that one-of-a-kind accent. But Villarias does a great job as the blood-thirst Count, especially with the use of his eyes, giving a very spooky look to the old boy. This is an enjoyable alternative version of the venerable classic.", "The Spanish-language Dr\u00e1cula (1931) is frequently said to be better than the simultaneously shot, English-language Dracula. I find this odd.The performances of Villar\u00edas, Rubio, and Arozamena are much less affecting than those of Lugosi, Frye, and Sloan. I'll readily grant that Rubio's behavior is more like than of a typical madman than is Frye's, but *realism* precludes vampires in the first place.The acting of some of the bit players in Dr\u00e1cula is poor. The lighting is simply thoughtless illumination. Continuity is ignored *ab initio*; for example, does Conde Dr\u00e1cula emerge from the coffin of Count Dracula (as shot by Freund or Browning), or from a packing crate?There are various points at which Dr\u00e1cula *is* better than Dracula. Holes in the script of Dracula are generally plugged in Dr\u00e1cula. While Sloan's acting is superior to that of Arozamena, the English-language script requires him to be unbelievably ineffectual. (Watch Sloan pause on the steps to explain that there is no time to lose, and then continue *walking*!)", "I am very happy I had the opportunity to see this (and its American counterpart) in the cinema, especially right before Halloween, and would probably rate this version comparable to the American version, except for the sorely miscast Carlos Villar\u00edas. He might be delightful in comedy or dramatic role, but he was out of his depth here.The cinematography in this Spanish-language version of Dracula is sometimes better than the English/ American-language version, and I liked the additional exterior shots, but while the Spanish cast mostly does well, leading vampire Carlos Villar\u00edas is sorely lacking in both charm and chill Lugosi brought to the role.While Lugosi was simultaneously sinister and cordial, Villarios looks like he is playing it for kids at a birthday party. His narrow, sloping shoulders were a bad contrast to Lugosi's broad shouldered poise and confident manner. Villarias lacks even the slightest physical intimidation in the role, appearing largely comical. When he is first revealed on the staircase, he looks nearly comical in his postured posing, despite the benefit of experimental (in its day) photography.", "I have read most of the comments on the spanish version of Dracula, and I have two hypotheses as to why can anyone say this is a better version than Browning's: 1.- YOU'VE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE INTRODUCTORY DOCUMENTARY IN THE DVD VERSION - I also saw the documentary and was very excited to hear that this version was better and I can almost say that I was looking at it with the intention of finding the better version no matter what reality said, but the movie  was definitely NOT better than the Browning's version. 2.- YOU DON'T SPEAK SPANISH - Folks, if you spoke spanish, believe me!!! you would understand how BAD this version is. It is so badly spoken (i hope not as bad as my english ;-) ) and so KITSCH!!!! it is incredible that anyone can say this is a good version.Having said this, I would like to comment on the film: Perhaps there is one or two scenes better directed if by \"better directed\" you mean a better use of film language (i.e. the \"Children of the night\" scene), but in general Browning's Dracula remains a classical version for a good reason: it is better. The acting is so bad that it becomes very difficult to see through it a good directing... but directing means not only moving the camera, but also to direct people, and in that sense this movie fails miserably. I am very sorry I am so blunt, but I feel I need to shake you all in order to wake you up."], "tt0021820": ["I like the movie, for what it is. I would like to see the earlier version, and compare. I've always thought of Warner Oland as kind of a ham. But it's impossible to judge by 1931 standards in 2007, so what do I know? The Karlov question had me curious. This is what Wikipedia had to say (yeah, I know-- it's Wikipedia, so who knows if it's true?):\"In 1922 the book was made into a Broadway play and the following year a motion picture. A second film version appeared in 1931. It is said that a young Boris Karloff, who previously had a few uncredited film roles, chose his stage name for his first screen credit in 1920 from a Russian mad scientist character named \"Boris Karlov\" in this novel. The name 'Boris Karlov' was used from MacGrath's book for the 1922 Broadway play, but by 1923 with actor Boris Karloff using the similar sounding variation, the film version renamed the character, played by Wallace Beery, 'Gregor Karlov'. In the 1931 film version, however, with Warner Oland playing the character, the mad scientist's name is restored to 'Boris Karlov', less than a year before Frankenstein would make Boris Karloff a household word for generations. Ironically, Boris Karloff would play many mad scientists on screen, but never 'Boris Karlov'.\"As a side note for those interested in original sources, the Harold MacGrath novel \"Drums of Jeopardy\" is available as a free e-text download at Project Gutenberg.", "Warner Oland stars as Dr Boris Karloff, a man out to avenge his daughter's suicide by killing off a Russian noble family that he holds responsible for her death. Warner Oland soon after this movie became famous in his portrayal of Charlie Chan in a series of movies about a famous Chinese detective and the mysteries he solves. Clara Blandick, the future Auntie Em in the Wizard of Oz plays a great character in a supporting role and is excellent in bringing comic relief to this little known drama from 1931. I saw this movie on a DVD by Alpha video. The film does have some scratches and the sound has some problems during the opening credits. It's a short movie at 66 minutes but seems to be right for the pace of the movie. The Drums of Jeopardy is a decent movie. I would call it a murder drama. It's definitely dated though. You can sure tell you're in the 30s both by the dialogue, and situations. You really have to be a fan of older movies to get the most out of this film.", "Since I don't know when this movie was made one can simply assume the name of the character that Warner \"Charlie Chan\" Oland plays was chosen simply by chance, but its true he does play Boris Karloff, er... Karlov.The plot of this movie has Oland getting revenge one of the Russian Royal families for the death of his daughter. It seems that his daughter was in the Royal Ballet and was the lover of one of the princes who sent her away causing her to attempt suicide. Oland finds a piece of the crown jewels, a necklace called the Drums of Jeopardy, in her possession. In her weakened state she runs to warn her lover only to die in his arms moments before her father arrives and attempts to wipe out the family. He's sent to the gulag vowing revenge. Years later, after the family  has been displaced by the revolution, they head to America where Oland begins sending drums from the necklace to the family members before killing them.(Legend says, if some one gets one of the separated drums, they will die with in 24 hours)This is a great movie that is hampered by the fact that it now seems rather static.Its one of the movies from the early days of sound films, when there would be little music and long moments of silence that played fine then, but now seem to slow things down to a crawl. The first half of this film is dynamite and moves like the wind as we go from Russia to New York and out to the country in a breezy 30 or thirty five minutes. There's lots of action and complications. The trouble comes in the second half where the movie is locked in the country house and its surrounding area as the surviving members of the royal family wait for Oland's attack. Its not bad its just too slow compared to the first half.I give it 7 out of ten over all, the first half scoring 9 and the second a 5, purely because it seems so slow after the first half.", "Like MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGET (1942), this is more thriller than horror but there is still enough atmosphere and thrills here to make it an entertaining ride (which, as with the above-mentioned film, clocks in at just over an hour and is therefore not allowed to overstay its welcome). The plot is that of a hoary melodrama - not unlike the Oriental Lon Chaney vehicle MR. WU (1927) - as an eminent personality (in this case, scientist Warner Oland: interestingly, his most famous role was the multiple genial appearances as popular Chinese sleuth Charlie Chan!) has his life virtually brought to a stand-still by the death, over her romantic attachment to a member of the aristocracy, of his young daughter. So, he swears vengeance and nearly accomplishes his mission, were it not for the intervention of an elderly but strong-willed lady (here, it is Clara Blandick, the landlady of the heroine who chooses to shelter one of Oland's 'targets') - though her annoying characterization reminded me of the middle-aged 'fraidy cat' maid in THE BAT WHISPERS (1930) and the romantically-inclined (albeit still very much way- past-her-prime) one in THE GHOUL (1933)!Incidentally, the title refers not to the musical instrument but to a diamond-studded necklace belonging to the upper-class family and which had been donated to Oland's daughter by her paramour. It eventually comes into play in the scientist's revenge scheme since he is gentlemanly (or is that sadistic?) enough to forewarn his next victim with a note accompanied by one of the jewels; by the way, Oland has an accomplice in a lanky and somber Mischa Auer, that is before he became everybody's favorite eccentric Russian! The few murder/action sequences deliver the goods - especially one in which Oland's shadow slowly bends over the kidnapped eldest nemesis to strangle him and then plants his body in a window so that, during a roof-top chase with the man's relatives and the Police, they take him for Oland and take several pot-shots at the poor soul! Then there is the finale where, as I said, it is Blandick who contrives to literally make the drop on Oland by pushing him through a trap-door down into the river running under his hiding-place/laboratory/operations center as he is about to blow everything sky-high via a potion he has concocted.Ultimately, this is a minor yet engaging outing that ought to be better-known (I only learned about it myself when I came across the film fairly recently)if only because Oland's character here is named - brace yourself - Boris Karlov (the picture under review came out eight months prior to FRANKENSTEIN, released the same year and which, I am sure no-one needs reminding, immortalized its star who was soon to be billed simply as \"Karloff, the Uncanny\")!!", "This movie is very curious when it comes to the name of the villain. Warner Oland stars as 'Boris Karlov'--and I am sure the real life Boris Karloff (famous for his horror films) took notice. Why they changed his name from Gregor in the 1923 version to Boris is curious. While the real Karloff was quite prolific in films by the time the 1931 remake debuted, he was not yet a star--and his iconic role in \"Frankenstein\" was still six months in the future. Perhaps it's just an odd coincidence.Now I mentioned that the film starred Warner Oland. If you aren't familiar with him, he popularized the character Charlie Chan and played him in a ton of films during the 1930s. He was a very prolific actor and starred in a lot of films other than the Chan series--though today he's known mostly as 'that Swedish guy who played Charlie Chan'. You might also notice Mischa Auer in a supporting role--a role totally unlike his usual comic ones.The film begins with Karlov's daughter on the brink of death. Boris blames her condition on a noble Russian family and he devotes his entire life to wiping them out--on-by-one. The drums, by the way, refer to a necklace. Karlov takes it apart and sends a piece of it to the victims before exacting his revenge.So is the film any good? Well, it's not \"Gone Withe the Wind\"! However, compared to other B suspense films, it's pretty good--with decent production values, a fast-paced script and plenty of suspense. But the film has its deficits as well--in particular, some really bad acting in some of the minor roles (it's like they are reading from cue cards) and a few of these scenes should have been re-shot (but for economy's sake, B movies did this as seldom as possible). But some of the acting was quite good--I liked Clara Blandick as the grouchy aunt and Oland seemed to have a lot of fun dispatching his victims! For example, I loved the wonderful poison gas scene at the 52 minute mark. Overall, you should not expect high art--just a decent and entertaining murder mystery/suspense picture-especially if you like this genre.By the way, this film is available through Alpha Video. And while I have mentioned this in many of my reviews, viewers should note that Alpha's DVDs have no restoration of any sort done to them. Like most of the rest I have seen, this one is in rough shape--though not so bad that you shouldn't watch. Unfortunately, many of Alpha's films just aren't available anywhere else, so if you are a fan of these sorts of films you have to just take what you can get.", "The Drums of Jeopardy (1931)** 1/2 (out of 4)Mildly entertaining mix of melodrama, horror and thriller as Dr. Boris Karlov (Warner Oland) seeks vengeance against the noble family he blames for the death of his daughter. The \"drums\", of the title, refers to a mysterious necklace that the doctor steals and whoever gets a piece of it is officially warned that they're going to die next.As far as \"B\" mystery-horror-thrillers go, THE DRUMS OF JEOPARDY isn't too bad but at the same time it's not all that good either. If you've seen enough of these types of films from the 1930's then you know that it seems they were being released weekly so you never quite know what you're going to get. Some of them feature nice budgets that allow their director's to do something with their weak screenplays whereas others have no effort behind them. This film is really split into two because it appears the first half was working on a decent budget and it almost feels as it was slashed because the second half of the picture takes away most of the action and instead features mostly dialogue scenes.The first half of the film is without question the best because it gives us a great set-up and a pretty effective scene as the grieving father confronts his dying daughter and this is followed up with a scene where he witnesses her death and takes it out on the family. From here we're given a couple effective murders scenes including one where we just see the shadows of the killer's hand going towards the victim. With that said, the second half really gets dragged down due to some boring locations as well as some dialogue scenes that just really drag on without much excitement.Oland, coming off playing Dr. FuManchu and a getting ready to take on a long Charlie Chan series, is in fine form, although, to be fair, this is the type of role that he could have played in his sleep. He's at least got enough energy to help carry the picture and a certain screen presence to help take the lower tier screenplay and bring it up a notch. The supporting cast isn't nearly in the same league and no one really stands out among them. THE DRUMS OF JEOPARDY isn't going to win any major awards and there are certainly much better thrillers out there but if you're a fan of the genre or Oland it's still worth watching.", "Totally implausible/ridiculous but good fun. A pre-Charlie Chan Warner Oland, a Swede, is Russian this time. He's bent on revenge and hams it up all the way.Neither Oland or the other Russian characters utter a word of Russian. The fleeing royals reach New York and bump into an ingenue and her peppery aunt who, of course, shelter the strangers in their country house. Wouldn't you?The lights go out more than once. The phone is dead. A claw-like hand jumps out of the curtain to grab the girl. Stuff used a thousand times. The plot creaks and the print used for the DVD is battered, but you could do worse for an early talkie.Mischa Auer lurks around in a pre-screwball role.", "This is another of the movies from 1931 that I never heard of until working through the list from Letterboxd. The concept of it was an interesting one and something that I've definitely seen more of as cinema goes on. Now the version I watched was 10 minutes shorter than the runtime listed on the Internet Movie Database. That is something I wanted to point out here. The synopsis though is a mad doctor is determined to take revenge on the family he believes responsible for his daughter's death.For this movie, we start with a young woman in bed. Her name is Anya Karlov (Florence Lake). There is an older woman watching over her and praying for her to get better. Anya seems to be dying and is upset to learn that a letter was sent to her father. She wants this woman taking care of her to keep a secret to what happened to her. We also see she has this fancy necklace with jewels on it.The letter then arrives to Dr. Boris Karlov (Warner Oland). He is upset and draws the attention of his assistant Peter (Mischa Auer). Dr. Karlov immediately heads to the home of his daughter. She is upset that he knows. This causes her to flee to the family she got the necklace from. Dr. Karlov knows whatever happened to her, it was caused by one of the children. The patriarch is General Petrov (George Fawcett). His brother is Prince Ivan (Ernest Hillard) and then there are his sons: Prince Nicholas (Lloyd Hughes) and Prince Gregor (Wallace MacDonald).They are having a fancy dinner where General Petrov wants to show this famous necklace to a guest. It is one that has drums on it where the head of them are rubies. It was stolen from India and the lore behind it is that if you take the necklace apart, it is a bad omen if you send a piece to someone. Gregor is nervous when asked to get it and instead the general sends Nicholas. They are shocked to find out that it is missing. This is when Dr. Karlov and Anya show up. He vows that he will kill this family for what they've done to his daughter since he isn't sure who caused her to harm herself.Dr. Karlov is then taken to Siberia, but word gets out that he's escaped. We read a letter that General Petrov has died after receiving a Drum of Jeopardy. The rest of this family flees on an ocean liner to America. The problem though, Dr. Karlov seems to be one step ahead of them and is picking them off one by one.Here is where I'm going to leave my recap of the movie as it doesn't have the deepest story to it. What I found interesting is that this is a remake of another movie from the previous decade. I didn't see anything about it being based off a novel, which makes it more interesting as well.Where I want to start though is with this necklace. I really like the idea of this cursed jewelry. The movie is interesting in painting both our heroes and villains as complicated characters. They have the ancestor that stole this necklace while in India. They refuse to give it back as well. I'm assuming the Petrovs are also from Russia, as they're also fleeing from the Bolsheviks. That is actually who killed General Petrov, but Dr. Karlov seems to be helping them as part of his revenge. This lore of the necklace though I thought was cool and a nice calling card as well.As I was saying with the complicated characters, Prince Gregor was the lover of Anya. Since the version I watched is missing 10 minutes, I'm wondering if part of the back-story is missing there. From what I gather, Anya is a member of the ballet and tried to kill herself. I'm not sure if she was with child and he refuses to stay with her or he stops seeing her or what the exact reason is. Regardless, he did give her the necklace and that is how her father gets it. Nicholas is actually a pretty stand up guy who becomes our hero. There is also of course Dr. Karlov. I wish the movie would have given him a bit more back-story before he starts to kill the Petrovs. This feels like an early version of The Abominable Dr. Phibes. This is less creative of course and this movie also paints Dr. Karlov as the villain when he is avenging his daughter. Issues with the censors could be the reason there. It does look like this was still pre-Hayes Code though.Since I've talked so much about the characters, I'll go to the acting next. I think that Oland is solid as Dr. Karlov. My issue with him is more of the writing. I do think he takes on this super smart character and portrays it well. He is steps ahead of everyone throughout most of it and it feels like Jigsaw could be borrowing from him here. June Collyer is good as Kitty Conover. She shows up when the Petrovs make it to America. She does fall into that troupe where she falls for Nicholas quickly, but I can work with it. Hughes is solid as our hero. Clara Blandick is funny as Kitty's mean old aunt Abbie Krantz. Hale Hamilton works as Martin Kent who is trying to stop Dr. Karlov. Aside from that I think MacDonald is good as the weasely brother and the rest of the cast rounds this out for what was needed for me.Then I'll combine the last two elements here of the cinematography and soundtrack. For the former it is fine. The copy I was watching wasn't in great shape which is a shame. We also don't get a lot in the way of the effects, but it also is early cinema and not that type of movie. The soundtrack was fit for what was needed, but doesn't necessarily stand out either.In conclusion here, I think that we get an interesting concept here with Dr. Karlov wanting revenge, the family not wanting to give up what happened and protecting their own. Also using this cursed necklace adds an element there. The acting helps to bring these characters to life. If I do have any issues, I think they needed a bit more fleshing out of some things for this to really work for me. Aside from that, I think the cinematography is fine and the soundtrack works for what was needed. Overall I'd say this is just over average for me though.", "Getting back home late at night after catching up with friends,I looked for an easy-going Horror title to view. When watching the likeable The Phantom (1931) last week,I remember another Horror from that year which I've not heard of before came up on \"recommended\",which led to me playing the drums of jeopardy.View on the film:For the second adaptation of prolific writer Harold McGrath's (who due to fears over discrimination, hid that he was deaf for almost all his career) novel, director George B. Seitz & cinematographer Arthur Reed drum up a lively atmosphere in the Old Dark House setting by stirring it with the \"Mad Scientist\" genre of chin-stroking baddies handing out underhanded knock-outs to complete Karlov's mission. Showing Karlov's wits with his use of a bulletproof vest, Seitz ends the movie on a wave that fully unveils Karlov's revenge plan. One of the credited writers for The Wizard of Oz, Florence Ryerson shows in this adaptation little sign of what was to come, with the pain that sets off Karlov's plans for revenge being left at a surface level, and all the people he targets being tied with flat dialogue. Greatly raising the quality of the film, Warner Oland gives a wicked cackling turn as Karlov,who bangs the drums of jeopardy.", "WARNING: SPOILERS: It doesn't matter to me how many reference books place this under the genre \"fantastic cinema,\" this does not qualify. The only possible \"horror\" is that Warner Oland is a bit more sadistic than the normal grieving father, but then again I've seen Mel Gibson in revenge films that far surpassed this one - and Gibson's are not horror either. In fact, \"Karlov\" (nod to Boris) is more akin to Lenin in this film so, in that regard, this is an anti-Communist message. As for the supposed \"curse\" of the jewelry, it's a mcguffin that has only a few moments, and no real link to the film. On to \"science fiction,\" the closest we come is a mysterious formula that we know nothing of, that has an effect we don't see. The mere idea that he's a \"scientist\" is of little interest, even if, in the beginning of the film, we see him tinkering with some test tubes in a secret lab.Now, the film itself is OK, with many clich\u00e9d characters, such as Oland's \"Fu Manchu\" type, gangsters, cops, spunky women, etc. Additionally, the print I saw was choppy with much film damage, but I tried not to let it cloud my judgment. 6 of 10.", "Even though Harold McGrath's novel \"The Drums of Jeopardy\" had been filmed in 1923 with Wallace Beery, Tiffany's all talking remake featured Warner Oland and was actually a reworking of Florence Ryerson's script \"The Return of Fu Manchu\" - a character that by 1931 Oland had made his own. It may have been only a Tiffany (probably the most prestigious of poverty row studios) but this must be one of Oland's best films and Mischa Auer, who for years had been playing eccentric bits, finally broke out with his characterization of a decandent syncophant.When scientist Dr. Boris Karlov (Oland) learns his daughter has attempted suicide but refuses to divulge her lover's name, he finds one clue - a necklace known as the \"drums of jeopardy\", that belongs to the aristocratic Petrov family. Doesn't take the viewer long to figure out which is the cad - the guilty, shifty looks of Prince Gregor (Wallace MacDonald) leave no doubt and with Karlov vowing to return the drums \"one - by - one\" (as only Oland can deliver that line) the game is now afoot!!1930, New York and Karlov has managed to intercept a letter to Martin Kent (Hale Hamilton) in which the desperate Petrov's ask for help before the crazed Karlov wipes out the entire family!! It's hard not to feel pity for Karlov - for coming to Petrov's house and confronting the family about the suicide of his daughter (Florence Lake, older sister of Arthur) he was sent to Siberia but with the Petrovs fleeing to America, he has more than had his revenge.This is just a rip snorter action packed film - before the boat docks, Nicholas (trusty Lloyd Hamilton) and Gregor are just one step ahead of Karlov, sometimes not even that!! Nicholas receives a blow to the head and finally collapses after convincing apartment owner Kitty (luminous June Collyer) that he is not a bad guy and getting her and her crotchety aunt (Clara Blandick) thoroughly involved in the doings of the mad doctor. For once the romance doesn't slow down the action - Collyer is not a damsel in distress but a vital part of the proceeding - it's the men who are collapsing around her!!A highlight of the film are the witty exchanges between criminologist Martin Kent and Karlov (\"I'm disappointed in you Kent, I didn't think you would have walked into my trap so blindly\", \"Would it surprise you to find out I deliberately let your man lead me here etc...\") Gregor, the real villain goes to Karlov's laboratory to point the finger at his unsuspecting brother in exchange for his life. The laboratory is a treasure trove of bubbling test tubes (\"I am just going to test this mixture\" ... and as the room is filled with blood curdling screams - \"Ah yes, it's perfect\"!!) - there is also a dungeon where Nick and Kitty are thrown. Nick has to kill Kitty with this huge butcher's knife (\"as you killed my daughter, so you must kill the one you love\" drawls Karlov who still believes Gregor's lies). Once back with his test tubes he chortles that he hopes they look for an escape, as they loosen the bricks water spurts from nowhere, quick enough to send them to a watery grave!!The production has a sumptuous look - lavish sets (the Petrov palace with a huge oval dining table, an art deco studio flat that has more of the look of a Park Avenue penthouse, an ocean liner and a State of the Arts laboratory)!!!!", "The movie starts very melodramatically, with a young woman in bed, tended by her mother, apparently dying. The reason for her deterioration is never stated, though it has to do with her relationship with some man. The acting here is poor. Her father (get this, his name is Boris Karlov, played by Warner Oland, acting like an evil Charlie Chan) enters, and demands the name of the man responsible, but his daughter refuses. A necklace, The Drums of Jeopardy, falls from under the bed covers, which he recognizes as belonging to the Petrovs, and vows revenge.The movie and acting get better in the second act as the Petrovs come to America, fleeing the Bolshevik revolution. Karlov, working for the Bolsheviks, is in America already, and waiting for them. The Petrov sons escape Karlov twice, and flee to a country mansion on a dark and stormy night. Karlov and his goons are right behind.This is an very 1930s movie with plot elements, and plot holes, typical of the period. The escaping Petrovs meet and are aided by a rich New York family. Karlov has a bullet-proof vest that defies Newton's third law of motion.Clara Blandick, playing the matron of the New York family, shines while providing some humor.", "This is a typical kind of early talky, the one where they just took the plot from a stage play and rolled it out. It has a lot of conventions of early 20th century theater, like turning out all the lights when they can't figure out how to get characters where they need to be for the next scene. (This movie does it TWICE).So a mad scientist, oddly enough named \"Boris Karlov\" (more on that later) discovers that his daughter has been dishonored by a noble Russian family. Flash forward till 1930, and the mad scientist has joined the Bolsheviks and is hunting down the former nobles in style. With better production values and actors, this might have been a better movie.Okay, now on to the weird coincidence. The name of the Mad Doctor character is \"Boris Karlov\", not to be confused with \"Boris Karloff\", the horror star. This movie was released in early 1931, before Karloff became a household name with Frankenstein. However, Karloff had been using that stage name since 1912. The story with the character's name was published in 1920. Chicken or the egg? But it does seem weird.", "Surely, it is not the best movie of the earlie talkies era. Nevertheless, The Drums of Jeopardy sets a fairly good pace since the beginning. Despite the mediocre script, the movie is enjoyable and keeps you entertained throughout its 65 minutes lenght. The players perform decently for the early 30's standards. I did get a few laughs from Clara Blandick's performance. I was, also, thrilled to see a character of a woman over 50 with a prominent role in a 1931 movie."], "tt0021828": ["This is a really good adventure film that's probably all but forgotten.The plot is simple. A woman travels into the jungle to find her husband, now a drunken court doctor for a jungle prince. He had left her years before because he thought she was having an affair. What happens when she gets there is the reason to watch.I won't lie, the first part of this film is slow. Its the trip to the prince's city and other than the chanting of rowers and the sounds of the jungle this is almost silent. Its not terrible since the scenes of jungle wild life and the odd danger is interesting.But its worth hanging on to the second half, since once the wife arrives its men being men as the prince and the doctor begin a strange game of chess for her. Its here that we get to see the good stuff, which I won't spoil other than to say crocodiles, tons of them. And this was in the day when you didn't fake it, they are there in quantity.This is jungle thrills of the real variety since you don't know if some one is really going to be dinner.Had these scenes been done today the digital effects would have reduced the tension because you'd know it wasn't real, this is...WOW.My sole complaint about the last 45 minutes has to do with how some scenes are shot. Today, thanks to better equipment and computers the camera can move more freely, here there are a couple of times I wish the camera moved so we could see some of the spectacle that ends this film better.Definitely put this on your to see list. Its not perfect and it is dated but its really a good film that deserves to be seen.", "Rose Hobart (DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE) travels deep into the jungles of Borneo to find her missing doctor husband (Charles Bickford), now the drunken court physician to capricious potentate, Prince Hashin (Georges Revavent).  Although her husband won't give her the time of day, the Prince decides this white woman will do to give him an heir to further his \"Aryan\" race.  After a slow (but not uninteresting) start, EAST OF BORNEO picks up with a couple of dynamic adventure scenes - one showing the heroes racing across the backs of crocodiles, and the other showcasing a fantastic volcanic eruption achieved by a primitive but still wondrous combination of rear screen projection and miniature work.  Leonard Maltin is all wrong about EAST OF BORNEO; although it's not quite as good as the later THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, this forgotten film (made by the same team responsible for Universal's Spanish-language DRACULA) is definitely worth seeking out.", "Once again, some genius decided to put the white credits over a white background, so we can only see about half the names during the opening. \"East of Borneo\" is one of the films from the Treeline/Reelmedia Action Classic collection, and the black and white edges are pretty washed out and blurred, since its from 1931. This was the fourth film for Rose Hobart (Linda Randolph) and the eighth part for Charles Bickford (Dr. Clark). Pity the filming locations are not listed, but it could have all been done on a Hollywood lot with rented animals. Linda goes trooping through the jungle to find her husband, although we're probably not really in the jungle, since she never closes the screen netting all the way to keep the flies out...lots of chanting, drumming, and someone gets et by a lion. Georges Renavent, who had been in the biz for 15 years by now, plays the ruthless and heartless Prince Hashim. Melford, the director, had been acting and directing since 1909, so while the story here is pretty simple, it does have a professional quality to it. Note that this was produced by Carl Laemmle Junior, the son of the founder of Universal Studios, so he probably got to make this exactly as he wanted it. Pretty good special effects towards the end. Gotta see for yourself....don't want to spoil any surprises for those who haven't seen it yet....", "The director and de facto producer also made the highly regarded Spanish version of Dracula the same year (and this film also features the female star of that film in a supporting role). Like that film, this has a lot going for it pictorially. Particularly impressive is the integration of the jungle animals with the lead characters; so often films of this era simply cut back and forth between the characters and stock footage (which does occur occasionally here, too). Possibly a good theatrical print would show some optical join-lines, but it is all quite imaginatively done. A sense of the menace of the jungle is artfully created by a long scene in which a huge snake hovers at the doorway of Rose Hobart's tent, and then slithers over a terrified native carrier on its way to the water. It's a slow, leisurely scene, with no music, and all the more creepy for having no one shout in terror or attack the snake as it goes about its business. Another scene filled with mood and menace occurs when the boat finally arrives at its upstream destination. Long stone stairs rise up from the river (not unlike Kurtz's compound in APOCALYPSE NOW), and bands of natives push live crocodiles from the steps with sticks to make it possible for the visitors to land. Later, when a man is chased and devoured by crocodiles, the man really seems to be in the water with the crocs; quite sensational. Unfortunately, the story is a somewhat tired melodrama along the lines of THE GREEN GODDESS or, a few years later, WHITE WOMAN. A woman travels into the jungle to find her alcoholic doctor husband. She finds him in the subservient thrall of a rajah-style prince who lords it over the natives in an Inca-styled compound. Unfortunately, the actor playing the villain here is no George Arliss or Charles Laughton. Nor does the script have the sophisticated flashes of WHITE WOMAN. Hobart makes a fine leading lady, but without a nuanced script she is limited in what she can do. This is an interesting curio that is worth seeing and gets good marks for trying, but isn't quite in the same league with pre-Code jungle classics like THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME and ISLAND OF LOST SOULS.", "In general, this action drama does a good job of establishing its atmosphere, but otherwise most of the movie doesn't really work very well. It has too many slow stretches, and it doesn't make use of many of the possibilities in its characters and setup.Rose Hobart and Charles Bickford star as an estranged couple, with the wife traveling deep into the wilds to find her husband, creating a delicate and dangerous situation between them and the native ruler whom the husband now serves as a court physician. The situation had lots of potential, but much of the middle part of the movie simply uses up screen time rehashing the same ground. The loyal servant girl played by Lupita Tovar also offered some possibilities, but she is never used for anything more than fetching things.The finale is full of action, but it would have worked much better if it had come after a more careful buildup. The movie does establish the jungle atmosphere quickly and believably, with a lot of wild animals and other details, and for a while the setting is interesting enough to keep your attention even when not a lot of significance happens. Eventually, though, the story just bogs down, and doesn't go much farther until just before the finale. Overall, \"East of Borneo\" is probably more significant as the source of material for Joseph Cornell's interesting experimental feature \"Rose Hobart\" than it is in its own right.", "This is one of those flicks that you have to give credit to just for trying. It's too bad the print I watched was so washed out, but that gave the picture an odd bit of atmosphere, what with the jungle setting and all. As many Tarzan and Jungle Jim films that I've seen over the years, I'm no longer surprised that the wild animals on view don't really belong there, but that's what's part of the fun for these old pictures. As an example here, I'd point to the South American toucan and African chimpanzees located on the island of Borneo in the Indian Ocean.But the picture gets a lot of mileage out of those crocodiles, doesn't it? And anytime a movie offers an early glimpse of an active volcano, you just know how it's all going to end. Before that happens, we're introduced to the principals, with pretty Linda Randolph (Rose Hobart) determined to track down her missing husband of three years (Charles Bickford). Turns out he's the permanently soused house physician to the self styled Prince Hashim of Marudu (Georges Revanent). Depending on your disposition, this could have been a pretty good gig if one were so inclined.Anyway, if you manage to stick around through the slow spots, this one ends on a fairly energetic note. Just be warned if you're inclined to seasickness because it gets a little wavy during the finale, and large objects tend to defy normal laws of gravity and physics. But overall, the film is actually quite entertaining in it's own way, what with it's version of the obligatory giant snake scare, a leopard attack, and all those crocodiles. Ah yes, the crocodiles. Don't try to out-swim them.", "Hoping to reconcile with her estranged husband, beautiful Rose Hobart (as Linda) travels deep into the treacherous jungles of Borneo. She finds boozy Charles Bickford (as Allan \"Clark\" Allan Randolph) is the \"court physician\" for tribal leader George Renavent (as Hashim). There are snakes, crocodiles, leopards, tigers and other dangerous animals to frighten Ms. Hobart. She is rejected by her husband, sadly; but, as the only \"white woman\" in the area, desired sexually by natives. Being leader, Mr. Renavent thinks he deserves the pretty prize, but Mr. Bickford might reconsider. As if that wasn't enough, there is a volcano threatening everyone. The man-eating crocodiles and rousing ending must have been exciting for the time, and the film does have some atmosphere.***** East of Borneo (8/1/31) George Melford ~ Rose Hobart, Charles Bickford, George Renavent, Lupita Tovar", "Just want to add my cheers for this film to the previous rater. Maltin is definitely wrong - he must have been in a bad mood when he saw it. The jungle animal perils are filmed with much more action and danger than seen in other picture, even the Weissmuller Tarzan flicks. Knowing that it was film by the crew who worked on Universal's Spanish version of Dracula (and the cast includes one of its actresses), I add that you can clearly see the Dracula set used for the jungle castle, draped with extra cobwebs and fineries. You can't miss those Gothic archways, though. This picture is great fun and can be had from the amazing Alpha Video for five bucks. Don't miss it!", "The best thing about East Of Borneo is the very clever way Universal was able to\nblend in real jungle footage into the plot of this movie. I'd love to know where\nCarl Laemmle got it. I can't believe he spent the money to actually go to the\nDutch East Indies and shoot it for the studio.

Plot if you could call it that had some of the elements of\nEast Of Borneo.Seen today East Of Borneo is quite archaic and I doubt we'll see a remake. It\nholds up well in spots and worth a look.", "Rose Hobart didn't make many films. Always outspoken (even in an 1980s interview) she didn't have time for all the Hollywood hoopla. She didn't like this film as she didn't like the star (Charles Bickford) but it is certainly worth a look.Linda (Rose Hobart) has traveled 6 thousand miles to Borneo to search for her husband. He is now a court physician to the Crown Prince Hashim (George Renavent). He lives in a splendid exotic castle on the edge of a volcano. Linda finds her husband, now an alcoholic and with a sultry native girl Neila (Lupita Tovar) hovering in the background. He left Linda years before because he suspected her of having an affair, but it was only in his imagination. He doesn't want her back and tells her to go. There is some good establishing jungle footage of wild animals and village life. The film gets better but it is not wonderful. The ending has the volcano erupting and the palace is spectacularly destroyed.Charles Bickford is wooden as usual and Rose Hobart is not exciting. There is definitely not enough of Lupita Tovar. This film does not do her justice. She was the exotic star of the Spanish language version of \"Dracula\". She married the producer, Paul Kohner. Their daughter, Susan, was also an actress and was Oscar nominated for her role as Sarah Jane in the 1959 version of \"Imitation of Life\".", "EAST OF BORNEO (Universal, 1931), produced and directed by George Melford, is a rarely seen and revived jungle-setting adventure starring Rose Hobart in a rare leading performance, with Charles Bickford, Georges Renavent, Lupita Tovar and Noble Johnson as the only other listed named actors appearing in the casting credits.Taken from a story by Dale Van Every, which plays liken a weekly chaptered adventure serial, the narrative opens with Linda Randolph (Rose Hobart), a young woman on board ship, traveling 6,000 miles to Borneo where she has traced her husband, Alan Randolph, whom she's been searching for nearly three years. With the information given her by the commissioner, Hans Von Blune, she learns her husband is now known to all as Doctor Alan Clark, who can now be found in Marado, some 300 miles inland East of Borneo. After a long and treacherous journey accompanied by native guides through the dangerous jungles consisting of pythons, tigers and pumas, Linda finally finds Alan (Charles Bickford), now a court physician in the palace located near a volcano, and house guest of Prince Hashin (Georges Renavent), who earlier had saved the drunken derelict doctor's life. Now good friends, aside from his boozing up liquor from time to time, Alan entertains the Prince with a game of checkers. Things begin to change when Linda and Alan come face to face, with Linda, stunned by Alan's drunken presence. In spite of how she's being treated, she still loves him and wants nothing more than to have him return home with her. Through plot development, it is learned that through their one year of marriage, Alan's medical experiments have kept him away from Linda, and because of her involvement with another man )Harry), whom she never loved, Alan accuses her of infidelity and leaves her. Alan is then told by Linda she never got the divorce and they are still legally married. Though Alan refuses her love and insists she leave, Linda finds herself forced to remain by orders of the Prince, for sinister reasons of his own.While 1931 brought forth Universal horror classics as DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN, many of their other theatrical releases from that year are virtually forgotten. EAST OF BORNEO, a lesser known product, may not be a horror film, but it does contain some chills of its own. Released a year before the classic THE MOST DANGEOUS GAME (RKO, 1932), EAST OF BORNEO does contain a villainous-host, that of Prince Hashin, who pleasures himself in watching guilty natives being fed to the crocodiles as one swims for his life to safety across the bank, only to meet with more hungry crocodiles on the other side. The Prince even intends on doing the same to his doctor friend after Alan's attempts to sneak Linda off the island at night. Georges Renavent, who makes one think about the bearded Cesar Romero from WEE WILLIE WINKIE (1937), gives a notable performance. Lupita Tovar as Nieia, a native girl on the island who has a passion for the doctor, is visible in certain scenes, but sadly given very little to do or say throughout its full 75 minutes.Though EAST OF BORNEO gets off to a very slow start, it does pick up considerably during its second half, even if some of the results are unbelievable at times. Unseen for many years, EAST OF BORNEO did have occasional broadcasts during the early years of cable television, such as Christian Broadcast Network in the early 1980s. Because it's a public domain title, prints have become available through various distributors since then on both video cassette and later DVD format. Aside from earthquake and volcano eruptions that occur in the story, EAST OF BORNEO may not offer any great shakes to contemporary viewers. Overall, for classic film buffs, it's still curiosity viewing if nothing else. (**)", "Charles Bickford stars in this pre-code potboiler from Universal. A woman (Rose Hobart) goes looking for her missing husband (Bickford). She finds him on a tropical island, an alcoholic doctor working for a jungle prince. The prince is very horny so look out, Rose. A corny and mostly dull B movie that gets ample use of stock footage of various animals, especially crocodiles. Jungle pictures can be very exciting but Tarzan this ain't. The climax involves the wild animals forming a union over harsh working conditions, leading to a revolt just as the island's obligatory volcano pops its top. Despite all this seemingly fun stuff, the movie is pretty much a snoozer.", "The only thing i liked about this were the animals. The story itself is not original. A love triangle involving jealousy and control. Yawn...... seen it a million times. I went into this thinking it would have more mystery since this was about a woman trying to find out what happened to her husband. The outcome was revealed very early on, and that was disappointing. It then became a romantic threesome drama. Granted it was a forced romance. The only thing interesting was the wildlife, and the menacing animals. I wish the film had focused more on that survival in the jungle and escaping terrifying animals."], "tt0021884": ["'Frankenstein', like Todd Browning's 'Dracula' released earlier the same year (1931, a landmark year which also saw the release of Fritz Lang's dazzling serial killer thriller 'M'!), is an important movie and should be compulsory viewing for any SF/horror fan, but it isn't a dull movie to be studied, it is a wonderfully entertaining movie to be ENJOYED. Okay, the modern viewer has to try and watch it without jaded and cynical eyes and take it in its historical context to really appreciate it, but that isn't difficult.  The acting is often hokey, the special effects, which were astonishing 70+ years ago, may look a little primitive by our standards, and the movie isn't anywhere near as terrifying to us as it was to 1930s movie audiences, but even so, I can't see how anyone can not LOVE this movie! Director James Whale was a lot more sophisticated and original than Todd Browning, and as much as I enjoy 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein' is a much better movie, and the best from this era, not counting its brilliant sequel 'Bride Of Frankenstein' which to mind mind actually surpasses it. Talented character actors Edward Van Sloan and Dwight Frye, both from 'Dracula', reappear in different but similar roles, and Colin Clive is fine as Henry Frankenstein, the prototype mad scientist, but the real star of the show, and the main reason this movie has lived for so many years, is the utterly superb performance by the legendary Boris Karloff as The Monster. I think Karloff is amazing in this and doesn't get the respect he deserves because many dismiss it as \"just a horror movie\". 'Frankenstein' is one of the most important and influential movies ever made, and is one movie I NEVER tire of no matter how many times I watch it, and James Whale is one of the most underrated directors of all time, looking at his innovative work in this, 'The Invisible Man', and especially 'Bride Of Frankenstein', the greatest sequel in the history of motion pictures. What a movie! What a director!", "After having been kicked out of school for his controversial work, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has been experimenting with the scientific forces behind the creation and perpetuation of life in his private laboratory. With the aid of his assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), Frankenstein finally tries his coup de grace--piecing together human parts to create a \"new\" life. When his experiments do not go exactly as planned, Frankenstein and his fellow villagers are endangered.Like a few other classics, director James Whale's 1931 masterpiece, Frankenstein, is one of those films that deserves to have every frame analyzed. Unlike most, Frankenstein is one of those classics that actually has had almost every frame analyzed. Countless theses and dissertations have been written about the film and its subtexts, so I can't imagine that I'd add anything novel along those lines in the space provided here. Instead, I'll take a brief look at some of the more straightforward aspects of Frankenstein that, in my view, contribute to its masterpiece status.The opening of the film has a very hefty dose of atmosphere, which continues more or less throughout its length. Although it was obviously filmed in a studio--the sky is a painted backdrop complete with wrinkles, this fact actually adds to the atmosphere of the film, even lending a slight surrealism. There is no score to speak of aside from the music playing during the titles, but the sounds that occur are just as effective, such as the ringing bell during the opening. There are also a lot of subtle visuals, and some merely subtly effective, such as the grim reaper at end of a long panning shot in the beginning of the film.The seriousness and realism of the grave-digging scene, complete with Henry Frankenstein throwing dirt at the grim reaper, is beautiful foreshadowing. As in the rest of the film, there is nothing jokey about this situation. Watch how effectively the actors convey a sense of toiling and franticness, how they convey the \"weight\" of the coffin. This is a curious fact about the film overall. Although the material is relatively melodramatic, and occasionally extremely so (especially in the case of Henry Frankenstein), the performances always come across as serious and realistic rather than campy (with the possible exception of a single snarling \"growl\" from the monster when he encounters Elizabeth, Frankenstein's bride-to-be). Contrast this to how Tod Browning's Dracula plays in the present day. In that film, Lugosi--although I love his performance--does come across as occasionally campy, especially in the close-ups of his \"hypnotically staring\" eyes. Even the one character that is meant to give some light comic relief, that of Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr), is comic only in that the character is a bit sarcastic, with a dry sense of humor. As such, Kerr portrays the Baron seriously, also.The production and set design, as in the sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935), adds volumes to the atmosphere and beauty of the film. The interior of the \"watchtower\", where Frankenstein's private laboratory is located, is reminiscent of German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and they both contrast and cohere wonderfully with the more symmetrical, right-angled lab equipment constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden.Because there is no score, the actors have no help in amping up the emotions in their performances. Despite this, rarely has either Boris Karloff's monster or Colin Clive's mad doctor been matched. Whale helps with some ingenious shots and sequences, such as the \"progressive close-ups\" when we first see the monster. He also gives us a number of \"stage-like\" devices that work remarkably well, such as the pans through cutaways in the set that in the film's world do not really exist. Interestingly, Whale has still had the cutaways decorated as if they are extant in the film's world. Although they may seem dated now, Whale's technique of fading to black between scenes also amplifies the sense of \"literary chapters\" in the story, and gives an effective, ambiguous sense of time passage between the scenes.Whale also achieves some wonderful, more understated scenes of horror in the film, often set up by contrasts. For example the severe contrast of the villager walking into the wedding party with his daughter, and the surreal bucolic adventure of the villagers working their way through the countryside to find the monster.Many younger viewers might have a difficult time watching Frankenstein if they are not used to black & white, slower paced, understated films with a different approach to acting. These classics are an acquired taste for younger generations, but of course it's a taste worth acquiring.", "\"We are about to unfold the story of Frankenstein, a man of science who sought to create a man after his own image without reckoning upon God. It is one of the strangest tales ever told. It deals with the two great mysteries of creation \u2013 life and death. I think it will thrill you. It may shock you. It might even \u2013 horrify you. So if any of you feel that you do not care to subject your nerves to such a strain, now's your chance to \u2013 uh, well, we warned you\". -Edward Van Sloan.Although this movie does not shock or thrill, it fascinates. The movie's cast is well worth repeating, Colin Clive, Boris Karloff, Mae Clarke, Edward Van Sloan, ETC. The movie contains obvious hints to German Expressionism, as the production team was inspired by films like Nosferatu, or The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The Gothic style fits the setting and the sets work beautifully. This movie would forever solidify Frankenstein in media and launched Boris Karloff into stardom. Although there is no musical score,it still works well without it as the horrifying scenes are much more emphasized than if it had music. All in all, this is a movie everyone should see, if you haven't seen it, go ahead and view this masterpiece. If you have seen it, now is the time for you to watch it again. \"However, if you do not care to put your nerves in such a strain, now's your chance to-uh, well, we warned you\".", "Although I have seen better prints of the film, this DVD issue of Universal Studio's famous FRANKENSTEIN is a magnificent package that is sure to delight any fan of classic horror. The film itself has been restored for content, and the Skal-hosted documentary--which traces the story from Mary Shelly's famous novel through its numerous film incarnations--is a delight, including numerous interviews with various historians, critics, and Karloff's daughter. The bonus audio track by Rudy Behlmer is also quite interesting, as are the various biographies and notes, and although the short film BOO is a spurious mix of footage from NOSFERATU, Dracula, THE CAT AND THE CANARY, and FRANKENSTEIN, it is an enjoyable little throw-away. All in all, it doesn't get much better than this.As for the film itself, the production of FRANKENSTEIN was prompted by the incredible success of the earlier Dracula--but where Dracula is a rather problematic and significantly dated film, FRANKENSTEIN was and remains one of the most original horror films to ever emerge from Hollywood. Much of the credit for this goes to director James Whale, who by all accounts was deeply influenced by silent German film and his own traumatic experiences during World War I--and who mixed those elements with occasional flourishes of macabre humor to create a remarkably consistent vision of Mary Shelly's original novel.Whale was extremely, extremely fortunate in his cast. Colin Clive was a difficult actor, but Whale not only managed to get him through the film but to draw from him his finest screen performance; Mae Clarke is a memorable Elizabeth; and Dwight Frye, so memorable in Dracula, tops himself as Fritz. But all eyes here are on Boris Karloff as the monster. Karloff had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, and although he appeared in quite a few films before FRANKENSTEIN he never really registered with the public. But in this role, acting under heavy make-up, weighed down by lead weights in his shoes and struts around his legs, and without a line of intelligible dialogue he offered a performance that transcended the word \"monster.\" This is a suffering being, dangerous mainly through innocence of his own power and the way of the world, goaded from disaster to disaster to disaster. Even some seventy-plus years later, it is difficult to imagine any other actor in the part.Karloff would play the monster again in two later films, one of them directed by Whale, but although THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a remarkable film in its own right, this is the original combination of talents and the original vision. Truly a national treasure, to be enjoyed over and over again. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "To clear the air on certain misconceptions that may arise from what I say here, I've read the book. I've liked the book. I realize that the movie truly has nothing in common with it aside from the fact that an artificial man is brought to life in both. But none of the above took away from my enjoyment of James Whale's rightly considered classic film. The tacked on introduction scene and the obligatory happy ending are indeed laughable when one thinks of what is horrific in this day and age, but I was hooked from the surreal credit sequence on. To me, the real ending of this film will always be at the burning windmill, an ending of an all-too-believable tragedy.Colin Clive is a little bit overblown as Herr Frankenstein, but he does a capable enough job with the title role (something that is usually tacked onto the monster instead). Edward Van Sloan, a favorite of mine from the Universal stock company, does quite well himself as Frankenstein's old teacher, Dr. Waldmann. As for Karloff...*exhale in admiration* what can I say? I first knew him as the narrator and voice of the Grinch in Dr Seus' \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (I didn't find this out until years later, but find out I did). \"Frankenstein\" marked the first time that I'd ever seen him on the screen for real. From the stiff walk to the eternally mournful face, he made the misunderstood monster his for the ages (it is also telling that, in spite of this, Karloff went on to a long, illustrious, if underappreciated, career).Two other facts that stick in my mind about this movie: the creation sequence and the naming of two of it's characters. The heavy-industrial machinery used to create the monster was inspired by the silent Fritz Lang classic, \"Metropolis\" (indeed, many films, from the original \"The Mummy\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\" to \"Dark City\" and \"The Matrix\" owe a debt to this excellent science fantasy), specifically the grafting of Maria's image onto the android. This machinery, I am told, would later go on to a return engagement in Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein\". Fact #2: anyone who has read the novel will know that the first name of Frankenstein is Victor and his best friend's Henry. Apparently the play (or perhaps the screenplay writers; I've no way of knowing) switched these two around to where we know have HENRY Frankenstein and VICTOR his best friend.The only thing that has \"sucked\" about \"Frankenstein\" is its imitators vainly trying to make lightning strike twice (pun intended). But don't bet the house on any ever coming close. A hundred years from now, this brilliant alternate work will still stand as truly classic as the book that helped to inspire it.", "James Whale's original FRANKENSTEIN is a short but memorable horror classic that has influenced so many other fright flicks, it should be considered the Godfather of Horror Movies. This was the first of Universal Studios' moody screen adaptations of literary Gothic horror (the other being Dracula). Put all thoughts regarding Mary Shelly's novel aside and see this original work of art, with Boris Karloff bringing the ultimate monster to life.The sets are a pure spin off of German Expressionism. The good Doctor Frankenstein's castle is twisted and distorted and seems to be not of this world. He is played by Colin Clive in a delightfully freakish performance. And, of course, the well-proportioned Fritz is there to help. Notice the signposts of evil in the opening grave robbing scenes. It is a prop-master's dream and the black and white photography displays a theatrical sense of spookiness. \"It's Alive!\" will live forever as one of the cinema's most familiar lines and the picture begins to sparkle as Karloff is brought to life. The influence of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS is evident during the dazzling scene of the Monster's birth.Boris Karloff is and always will be the prototypical Monster. The closeups of his face are truly frightening after all these years. He is walking death, however, Karloff gives him a hint of sadness, of a creature who was not meant to be. The flower-toss scene with the little girl was so controversial at the time of the film's release, it was cut from many versions. The new, restored print available on video has it.I know FRANKENSTEIN has been spoofed many times and is wide-open to criticism regarding its dated look. Mel Brooks went so far as to use the actual props from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory in his hilarious send-up, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN. Be sure to keep an open mind and watch it in the dark. Boris Karloff and James Whale have created a monstrously fun film.", "Even though in 1931 this movie was already a remake, this is an age-old classic. Done in 1931, fully black and white, this amazingly creepy tale still bears the marks of a genuine masterpiece. Having withstood the tests of time, I find this brilliantly directed portrayal just as darkly enchanting as I did 30 years ago. It is hard to believe that it has been over 70 years since this wonderful production was first released, but that not withstanding, it is a hauntingly beautiful, disturbingly tragic work of pure genius which is still just as compelling today as it was when it was made.In my opinion, this is also Karloff's best work. In this desensitized society, I feel honored and humbled to be able to view a movie of this caliber. When it was released, it was the scariest thing to be put on film. Today, there are gore effects, CGI, and a plethora of other mediums with which to shock and amaze us.Soon, the makeup artists of old will be wholly lost to the industry. If for no other reason, we should cherish these classics. Witness the industry when true artisans plied their crafts.The casting of Karloff in this part was the epitome of ideal casting. There was no other actor at that time, who could have contributed to this role, the darkling charm which Karloff demonstrated through this character. Of all the remakes done of this classic, I still favor the original work. The only remake which contains even the smallest degree of the magic of this original was the 1974 Mel Brooks parody, \"Young Frankenstein.\"I love this movie, and even by today's standards, it still rates a 9.1/10 from...the Fiend :.", "Of all the great Universal horror classics and the legendary monsters who came from them by far the one with the most popular appeal has been Frankenstein. Baron Henry Frankenstein and his creature, the result of him probing into the mysteries of life itself, arouse both horror and sadness at the same time.Colin Clive is the scientist nobleman who's not been as involved as he should be considering he's about to get married to Mae Clarke. She and best friend John Boles are concerned about him, spending days at a time in that laboratory he has in an abandoned old mill. They ought to be concerned, they find him claiming he can create life out a lot of old body parts. He claims also to have discovered the electrical ray that created life itself on this planet.What he creates is played by Boris Karloff in the film that launched his career in the horror genre. With nothing but grunts and spastic movements Karloff captures the essence of new life with the innocence of a newborn and the strength of Atlas.That's the key to the monster's character and why we feel such pity for him. If newborn babies had his power, they'd be as the monster was, striking out at what they don't understand or who does not give them instantly what they want. The monster in fact is a newborn creature and it's when he kills little Marilyn Harris we know he has to be destroyed.Coming over from that other Universal horror classic Dracula are Dwight Frye who plays the hunchback Fritz, Clive's assistant who pays dearly for taunting the monster and Edward Van Sloan who is Clive's professorial mentor. Sadly Van Sloan does not handle the creature quite as well as he does Bela Lugosi.Though Frankenstein and the other Universal horror classics have taken quite a beating from first Abbott&Costello, then the gorier Hammer films recreations and finally from Mel Brooks, Frankenstein still has the power to entertain and to fascinate.", "Revisiting Frankenstein is always a wonderful experience. I watch it today with the same enthusiasm and awe I did nearly 35 years ago. Everything about the film is so perfect. Acting, direction, cinematography, set design, plot, dialogue, special effects, etc. are top notch. And although each of these areas deserves to be discussed in detail (and have in the volumes that have been written on Frankenstein), I'll focus on two areas that really standout to me - Boris Karloff as the monster and James Whales direction.Is there a more iconic image in horror than Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster? I sincerely doubt it. Even those who wouldn't be caught dead watching a horror film are familiar with that image. Beyond Jack Pierce's make-up, Karloff is amazing in the role. Even with the make-up, Karloff gives the monster life. We are able to see and feel the emotions the monster goes through. There is no better example than the scene with the monster and the little girl. As the monster stumbles out of the woods, there is a cautious look about him as his experiences with humans have thus far been less than satisfactory. But when the little girl accepts him and wants to play with him, the look of caution is transformed into a look of utter happiness. He smiles, he laughs, and he plays. But that emotion is replaced by one of confusion mixed with anger when he accidentally kills the girl. It's all there on Karloff wonderful face. It's this life that Karloff imbibes in the monster that makes Frankenstein a real classic.I've always thought that James Whale's direction was ahead of its time. In an era when directors were using what I call the \"plant and shoot\" method of filming, Whale made his camera a fluid part of the action. Whale takes the viewer beyond just watching moving images. He uses the camera to take the viewer into the scene. A small example is the way Whale filmed characters moving from one room to the next. The camera moves with the characters. Another example is the tracking shot Whale uses as the father carries his dead child into the town. As I said earlier, it has a fluidity in the way Whale filmed these scenes that makes it seem more natural. Finally, the way Whale introduces the monster is a highlight of the film. The monster backs into the room. As he turns, Whale shows the monster with three quick, ever tighter shots, ending with a close-up of the monster's face. Every Hollywood star of that era could have only wished for an introduction like that.While I have done nothing but praise Frankenstein, I'm not such a fan that I can't spot flaws in the film. The major issue with me has always been the way the scenes of action, horror, and violence are inter-cut with scenes of tranquility and bliss. I realize that was the way things were done in the 30s so people wouldn't, in essence, overload on horror, but it can make the film seem a little disjointed. But it's difficult to hold Whale overly responsible for this custom of the period.", "MORD39 RATING:   ****  out of  ****Dark, cloudy nights. Thunder and lightning. Colin Clive's Frankenstein shouts: \"It's Alive!\", and Boris Karloff lurches forth in Jack Pierce's greatest monster makeup of all time....What more can be said about this classic?It's one of the first (and greatest) horror movies of all time and required viewing. Karloff's sympathetic monster can evoke fear as well as break our hearts. This film made him a huge star after years of working as an unknown in tons of features.James Whale is a masterful director, though there are less \"light moments\" in FRANKENSTEIN than some of his later horror films. Interestingly enough, the lack of a music score in this movie actually works in its favor.Tight, brisk, and oozing with the stuff nightmares are made of, this grandaddy of all monster films needs no further selling.", "Of all the \"monsters\" constructed out of the human imagination, I can't imagine one more sympathetic than Frankenstein's monster. In fact, I have trouble even thinking of him as a monster. Instead, he surely must be Frankenstein's \"creature\" or Frankenstein's \"creation.\" It's the sympathetic nature of the creature that gives the movie it's greatest power - it's perhaps the only \"monster movie\" I can think of where I feel sorry for the actual monster (true, one feels sorry for the afflicted people who become werewolves, but not for the actual werewolf.) Think about this poor creature. After his creation by Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) he is, by Frankenstein's own admission, kept isolated and in darkness, and his only regular \"companionship\" seems to have been from the hunchback Fritz (Dwight Frye) - Frankenstein's assistant who takes great delight in tormenting the creature with torches and whips. Under the circumstances, could the creature have been expected to turn out to be a ballet dancer? This movie is both a social worker's and a psychologist's delight. The social worker will see in the creature a classic depiction of an abused child (for that's what the creature was - as Frankenstein himself put it, he didn't give life back to the dead, this \"body\" had never lived in its new form; it was, in fact, a child.) For the psychologist there's a study of obsession in Frankenstein (who, it seems to me, gives up on his creature altogether too easily) and Fritz is a wonderful character from the psychological perspective: a man probably tormented and ridiculed and abused all his life, who suddenly - when the opportunity presents itself - becomes the tormenter, abuser and ridiculer. But the creature is always an object of sympathy. When he killed Fritz, I thought \"good for him!\" When he killed the little girl Maria (Marilyn Harris) it's clearly portrayed as a dreadful accident - he was playing with her, but he was too strong for her. When the windmill breaks out in flames, how can one not empathize with the creature's terror? And yet - in the powerful sympathetic portrayal of the creature also lies the story's greatest weakness. After constructing the body from the parts of dead bodies (and I must confess that I wondered, when Frankenstein lifted the creature's hand - before it was brought to life - and proudly exclaimed \"no decay\", I wondered \"why?\" It certainly didn't look like there was a refrigerated morgue in that place to keep the body fresh!) Frankenstein sends Fritz to a local medical school to steal a brain. Great play is made from the fact that the brain Fritz came back with was a criminal's brain - an evil one from a violent man, as Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) described it. We're clearly to think that the evil brain was somehow responsible for the creature turning out this way, but that was inconsistent with everything else portrayed here. Here we find an early example of nature vs. nurture. I never thought that the havoc wreaked by the creature was because of its brain. The creature didn't have an evil nature; it was the way it was because of the way it was nurtured. The whole \"evil brain\" story underlying the monster's actions seemed to me to weaken the story.Boris Karloff was magnificent as the creature. In a voiceless role (aside from a few growls) he managed to portray a huge range of emotions: confusion, anger, fear, rage, playfulness, excitement, panic-stricken terror just to name a few. Edward Van Sloan as Dr. Waldman offered what I thought was his best performance in the Universal \"monster movie\" collection - at least of those I've seen. Dr. Waldman seemed more rounded and certainly more emotional than Van Helsing in \"Dracula\" or Muller in \"The Mummy.\" Clive did a good job of portraying two sides of Frankenstein - the obsessed scientist who wants to play God, and the repentant one who wants nothing more than to turn the clock back, and Mae Clarke was pretty good as his fianc\u00e9 Elizabeth. The only disappointment in performances was that of Dwight Frye as Fritz. After a brilliant performance as Renfield in \"Dracula\" I didn't think he really captured this role.Two scenes stay with me from this movie. Maria's death - which clearly the creature didn't mean to happen - and the panicked creature trapped in the burning windmill. (I'd have liked the movie to have ended with that scene, actually.) So - great performances, but the issue of the brain left me a little cold, and detracted from the best and most meaningful issue raised by the story. All in all - 7/10", "Few will disagree that \"Bride of Frankenstein\" is in so many ways a better picture than the original.  But since they both involve the same director and primary cast, I consider them as two parts of the same movie.I have no complaints at all about \"Bride\".  It certainly benefits from a more deeply thought-out script and an adequately bankrolled sense of delight in the macabre. The unarguable \"improvements\" in the sequel are often, for me, the very things that makes the original so special.The major technical improvements  during the short years between the original and sequel have made \"Frankenstein\" seem perhaps older than it is. The lack of a score and less showy camerawork give it almost a documentary quality, not unlike the famous Hindenberg newsreel footage. \"Frankenstein\" feels like this is an actual record of exactly how it looked and felt the day Dr. Frankenstein did his evil deed!I'm not saying that \"Frankenstein\" seems primitive in a bad way--unlike '31's \"Dracula\" with it's \"point the camera at the stage because we can't move the camera\" lack of technique. The oldness adds to it's greatness. The graininess of the picture, the shrill sound effects and James Whale's unusual cutting style of deliberate jump-cuts (especially in the scene when the Creature makes his big entrance and, moments later, reaches longingly for the sunlight)contribute to the realness of the story and the film.It gave me nightmares as a kid; only now, I know why.", "Though not as spectacular as one would expect of such a classic, this loose interpretation of Mary Shelley's oft-told tale delivers. The familiar story focuses on Dr. Victor Frankenstein, the reclusive, stereotypical mad scientist obsessed with creating new life from stitched-together corpses. But something goes terribly wrong when the brain he uses turns out to be that of a criminal. The film starts out slow but redeems itself with time, particularly the windmill climax scene that by 1931 standards is nothing short of stellar. In one of filmdom's all-time great performances, Boris Karloff plays the monster as a sort of tragic figure unable to comprehend right from wrong, and the audience is left feeling more sympathetic than frightened by him.", "While certainly leagues ahead of Browning's \"Dracula\", Whale's Frankenstein still creaks aplenty, and in comparison to it's two sequels it looks primitive indeed, and yet....of all the Universal horrors, this is the most compelling and timeless.I find it ironic how, in discussions of the Frankenstein legend, this film is often considered as just a footnote only worth discussing for the influence it had on physical depictions of the monster, and dismissed in favor of Branagh's \"adaption\" or Fisher's excellent \"Curse of Frankenstein\". The rationale is often that those versions are more faithful to the book. But I disagree, and if you care to read, I'll explain why.I will admit, firsthand, that Branagh's film follows the PLOT of the novel with minimal changes, however I feel that the changes, despite their minimal size, are detrimental to the novel's SPIRIT. And although I will proudly praise Fisher's version, He seems to be less concerned with focusing on the novel's themes than he is with his \"F--- the rich\" subplot he includes in all his movies. Whale's version discards the plot, but creates an excellent abstract adaption that drives home the novel's themes better than anyone else has, with the exception of \"Frankenstein: The True Story\" and Fisher's \"Frankenstein must be Destroyed\". One big complaint, is how Karloff's Monster isn't as sympathetic as the novel's Monster; pure tripe in my opinion.If anything; Karloff's portrayal is MORE sympathetic than the book's Creature. Critics say that's impossible because the Creature is given a \"criminal brain\" by Fritz, but that would only be a valid argument if he was shown to be violent solely for that reason, and he isn't. First, \"abnormal brain of the typical criminal\" could mean anything given the period's beliefs, perhaps the man in question was mentally ill, or had killed in self-defense, or was a minority of some sort. But Karloff's Monster does not turn violent for no reason, he does for flimsy reasons, but reason's nonetheless excusable because he's so stupid he walks backward and doesn't know people can drown. The creature is provoked by the sadistic Fritz, reacts angrily, is taunted, then attacks. Frankenstein, unwilling to take responsibility, has the creature locked away to be \"disciplined\" by Fritz. The creature kill's Fritz and breaks loose. And even then, his murders are in self-defense or accidents. The book's Creature goes through similar persecution(likely, but left ambiguous because it's told in flashback), but commits murder out of jealousy and to prove points, to COMPLETE innocents. Add the fact that the creature in the book understands the consequences, and feels no remorse until later, it becomes clear that, monster or not, he's a control-freak sociopath like Ted Bundy. The creature of the film is more like a retarded child who lashes out at bullies. The novel's creature kidnaps a child to \"make him my companion\"(plenty of child-abductors who are not pedophiles do the same thing in real life), then gleefully kills him when he learns he is Frankenstein's brother and frames a servant girl for the murder. In contrast, the film's Creature gently plays with a little girl, but accidentally drowns her, and dies at the hands of a mob who really DON'T have any proof he's guilty, in a scene reminiscent of both a Klan lynching and Christ's crucifixion. Yeah, what an 'unsympathetic' character in comparison to the book(Rolls eyes).Both characters are unpredictable and dangerous, but does Karloff's Creature really come off as unsympathetic just because he doesn't talk endlessly like the novel's monster? Would you rather pity the equivalent of Ted Bundy because he can talk rather than the equivalent of Lenny from \"Of Mice & Men\" because he cannot? I also want to point out how, name change and assistant aside, Colin Clive's portrayal of Frankenstein comes closer, personality wise, than any others. Clive is criticized for his hammy \"It's Alive!\" line, but in the novel, Frankenstein raves like that for SEVERAL CHAPTERS. This film doesn't take the easy way out by making Frankenstein into a monster-hunting hero(Branagh) or into a 19th century Lex Luthor(Fisher); he's like Shelley's portrayal; basically well-meaning and fully blessed with all any man could want, but secretive, callous, neglectful, and unwilling to see consequences until it's either too late or too early. I think Clive's otherwise restrained portrayal fares better than Branagh's, who overacts \"It's Alive\" style in EVERY scene. The fact that Karloff inspires more fear and more pity with a few grunts than De Niro does in Branagh's whole movie is also telling.So what exactly is the problem with Whale's film? It features the most spiritually accurate Dr. Frankenstein ever, drives home the themes of the plot better than any other version, the accusation that the monster is unsympathetic is horse ca ca since he's more sympathetic than he is in the actual novel, so what's to hate? The best answer is to visit the comments section for this movie under \"hated\" and the comment's under \"loved\" for Branaghs. 99.9% of the complaints are by children who hate it because it's an old movie in black & white, or who make homophobic comment's about James Whale(who was gay). The people who like the Branagh movie mostly just love it because it's in color, or because they are teenage English lit fan girls who think Branagh is hot, and any movie with attractive leads HAS to be better right? If they say they like it because it's more faithful they are lying because they never read it, or did read it but didn't like it, and therefore have no right to demand fidelity to source material they didn't like themselves.This movie isn't perfect, but of the 3 films I've cited as being the best spiritual adaptations, it's the best. Simply; it's the greatest Frankenstein movie ever made as of now.~", "This is simply the greatest horror movie ever made,, Dracula is a close second and say phantom of the opera,, anyway,, Bela Lugosi, gives his best performance i think of his whole career right here in this movie..

Colin Clive is likewise great as the driven man whose mad dream becomes a lumbering nightmare. Mention must also be made of Dwight Frye as the childishly cruel Fritz. Horror is, indeed, Universal. Mary Shelley would've been proud.", "After buying the 'Legacy' DVDs for the classic Universal Big Three (Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein monster) I've had a good time going back & revisiting all the old favorites of my childhood. I started with the monster & have to admit I found this first interpretation of Whale's monster story to be a bit lacking. Not bad, but not as great as it's hyped to be, unlike its sequel.The opening setting for the film is certainly impressive, with the tearful mourners and the 'mad' doctor and henchman lurking in the background, waiting to take the freshly buried corpse (He's just resting, waiting for a new life to come). Colin Clive sets the tone for the movie as he tosses a big shovel full of dirt in the face of the statue of Death that's positioned behind him. Clive is really the star in this one & it's his performance that kept me into this one for the most part, particularly the unforgettable sequence as he gives life to the monster in front of the stunned eyes of his soon to be wife Elizabeth, Victor, and his old mentor Dr. Waldman.Any review of FRANKENSTEIN wouldn't be complete without a mention of \"Karloff\". He gives a good deal of humanity to the monster & I certainly empathized with his plight of being thrust into an alien world, where everyone, including his maker, is all too ready to shun him because of how different he is from the \"normal\" folks. But Karloff's screen time feels awfully small compared to how much we get of him in the \"Bride\". There's a feeling that there could've been a lot more for Whale to explore with the monster in the movie, but couldn't due to the limited runtime.To conclude, I'll say 'Frankenstein' is just a \"good\" movie that certainly is a sufficient starting point for the greatness that would come 4 years later.7/10", "This movie comes off as silly at times and brilliant at others, but it is probably considered to be one of the greatest monster movies of all time. The greatest thing to come out of this movie was the performance of Boris Karloff as the monster, it is just incredible how much emotion and feeling he was able to convey while under all that makeup. The direction of James Whale is spot on with a great use of sets and outdoor locations, in fact, the only real flaw in the film lies in the script, which has a few situations that make very little sense and because of which interrupts the films flow. But other than that, Frankenstein is a classic and very important movie, and it launched Karloff on to a great career, plus the sequel Bride Of Frankenstein is even better. 4 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GomHi6vIds4", "Oh,the many tellings and variations of this classic story.This,without question,is the best presentation of the classic story by Mary Shelley. The film was presented in such a way that makes you feel as though you are watching a stage play rather than a film.A creature is given the complicated thing called life.His large,overpowering human form,coupled with the limited capacity to grow,and learn,turn out to be very deadly indeed.He is,basically,a very large baby,who does not understand the world around him.He wreaks havoc on those who he feels are out to hurt him.I have seen the completed version of this film,complete with the disturbing sequence involving the little girl with the flowers,which was cut out of the film for many years.It is indeed shocking,and once you see it,you will understand why this was done.While you are shocked at this,at the same time you are sympathetic with the creature,knowing that he does not understand what he is doing,and meant no harm.Most movie monsters,particularly of this era,are just evil beings that make us cheer with delight at the sight of their destruction.When it comes to Frankenstein,we are almost sad to see this creature,who did not ask for life to begin with,meet his end.Classic horror,classic film.", "A brilliant young scientist creates life from the dead but lives to regret it when his creation goes on the rampage.Though inevitably dated and primitive by modern standards, Frankenstein remains a tremendously impressive film and a tribute to its still somewhat under-rated director, the eccentric Englishman James Whale.Where so many early talkies were static and wordy, Frankenstein skips unnecessary dialogue and exposition and drives through its plot at a speed that seems almost indecent nowadays. Compared to overblown remakes like Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version, Whale's work now seems like a masterpiece of brevity and minimalism. His constantly moving camera, incisive editing and dramatic use of close-ups are a mile ahead of anything far more prestigious directors were doing at the time. Expressionist photography and eccentric set designs lend atmosphere, menace and help augment some rather ripe performances; a foretaste of the paths Whale would tread in the sequel Bride of Frankenstein four years later.And then of course there's Karloff. With comparatively few scenes and no dialogue he nonetheless manages to create a complex, intimidating, yet sympathetic creature - one of the great mimes in talking cinema and thanks in no small degree to the freedom given to him under Jack Pierce's iconic make-up.A historic piece of cinema, and one that still stands the test of time as both art and entertainment.", "Best lines in the movie belong to Colin Clive, as Henry Frankenstein, after he creates the monster. \"It's ALIVE! Oh, it's alive! Get beck -- get BECK!\" I've never felt so good in my life as Henry Frankenstein feels at that moment, not even after a foot massage in an Egyptian health caf\u00e9.Unfortunately, Henry has stepped on the toes of God or the gods, and created life, a procedure to which the gods have the franchise. Well, it was to be expected. The novel was written by Percy Shelley's girl friend, Mary Wolstonecraft, in 1816 and the air was filled with electricity, so to speak. Science was beginning to challenge religion along a broad front, culminating in 1859 with the publication of Darwin's \"Origin of Species.\" The idea was beginning to take hold that science could do anything.The notion, of course, is incomplete. Even today, almost two hundred years later, there are events that no scientist has ever been able adequately to explain. Why are cats fascinated by flushing toilets? If the universe is expanding, what the hell is it expanding INTO? Why is it that every time I put my T shirts in the dryer they come back inside out? Why is hail always the size of something else?Fritz, the hunchbacked dwarf, who was never in the novel, really screws Frankenstein's experiment up when he drops the \"normal\" brain and substitutes an \"abnormal\" brain. I liked Mel Brooks' take on this incident, when the dwarf is later asked which brain he took, and the dwarf answers, \"A normal brain. Belonged to somebody called A. B. Normal.\" Fritz muddied up the story too, because the point is made that the monster is not so abnormal after all. If a little girl treats him politely and asks him to join her in throwing flowers into the lake, the creature whimpers like a puppy. Who know? If he'd been treated with more respect instead of being teased with flaming torches, he might have become a philosopher or a champion polo player.Karloff gets to snarl but not speak, and his monster doesn't merely shuffle around either. It moves quickly when it has to, and even darts from place to place. In one shot -- and I don't know how they pulled this off -- the monster leans forward until his center of gravity is a few inches in front of the tips of his shoes. He's at an acute angle from the perpendicular but he's still upright. They may have nailed his shoes to the floor.I suppose it's a happy ending since Henry Frankenstein gets to marry his girl friend, although they don't show any signs of loving each other. But there have been a number of deaths, including the little girl whom the monster mistakenly throws into the lake. Possibly Henry can break out his Van de Graaff generators and bring her back to life.The movie is short and it's really a cultural icon, so you should see it. If you don't you'll miss a lot of jokes on TV shows, and you'll get all mixed up and start calling the monster \"Frankenstein\", a mistake so gauche that it will enable you to clear a room without using a gun.", "Count me as one member of the \"Star Wars\" generation who as a teenager loved this movie at first sight and has watched it with renewed pleasure a dozen times since. A small but loyal number of movie fans my age and younger feel the same way about \"Frankenstein\" (and other Universal Horror pictures); but for those struggling to appreciate it I offer a few suggestions.Cast your mind back to 1931 and imagine that you\u2014like the audiences at the time\u2014are seeing the now overfamiliar monster makeup for the first time. You probably haven't read the Mary Shelley novel on which the film is based; and you've never seen one of the stage productions based on the novel. This is a fresh experience for you. You don't know what the monster is going to look like and you don't know what it's going to do.Don't take the film for granted. We live in pedantic times when sci-fi fanboys complain that it's unrealistic for Spider-Man to spin webs from his own physiognomy rather than from metal contraptions as in the comic books; that the actress playing Storm in \"X-Men\" is the wrong shade of black. In this age of irrelevant concerns, \"Frankenstein\" can't hope to survive our dull-witted scrutiny; so don't be like the mob. The film's many defects are minor, easily ignored, and sometimes part of the fun. In some ways it is technically crude, but director James Whale and his crew have a sense of artistry and a knack for storytelling that surpass that of most modern filmmakers. Props and hand gestures frequently change between shots, giving the film the weird beauty and stitched-together quality of the monster himself. John Boles and Mae Clarke (as Henry Frankenstein's friend and fianc\u00e9e respectively) are dull and stiff. Some plot details are implausible: Why doesn't Dr. Frankenstein notice that he's using an inferior brain? Why does the script insist that the brain is a criminal one at all when it's clear that the monster means no one any harm\u2014at least before people attack him? The final scene is irritating. It's an attempt to end on a light-hearted note for those too easily frightened and upset by unpleasantness.Use your imagination. Modern movies have dulled our ability to know a profoundly disturbing tale when we see one, unless buckets of blood and gore are hurled at us. Remember this is the story of a scientist who brings to life a dead body created from pieces of human corpses; it's the story of a creator who betrays his own creature, condemning him to a short life of being hated and reviled. If this story inspires no fear or pity in you, you've lost your ability to feel.Boris Karloff as the Monster is worth a thousand CGI monsters; his pitiful reaction to seeing light for the first time would be unforgettable in a movie one-tenth this good. Colin Clive (as Henry Frankenstein) has a rich, musical voice and an intense concentration that makes his performance as alive as Frankenstein's creation. Weird and wonderful support is provided by Dwight Frye as the hunchbacked assistant and Edward Van Sloan as Frankenstein's former professor.If you believe this film is inferior to more modern movies, I would only half-agree with you: \"Bride of Frankenstein,\" released four years later, is even better than the original.", "This movie is a classic that shall live for generations to come. An ambitious doctor(Colin Clive) creates life in a creature assembled from organs and limbs of the dead.Boris Karloff, as the Monster, becomes a horror movie icon. The lighting, crude camera work, sound and special effects combine to make a simple movie a masterpiece. The image of the Frankenstein monster will always stand for fear of the uncontrolled.", "Probably no other film except Gone With The Wind has attracted so much critical and public attention as Frankenstein. And as far as influence is concerned, this movie is the winner. I lost count after 1977, but up to that time there were at least sixty movie spin-offs. How many did GWTW generate? A handful at most.Just about all these movie spin-offs of Frankenstein are direct descendants of the 1823 stage dramatization (in Two Acts) by Richard Brinsley Peake. I looked up Peake's name on IMDb. He has not one single movie credit. Mary Shelley, on the other hand, has over fifty.Peake's adapted his stage play, Presumption or The Fate of Frankenstein, from Mrs Shelley without her knowledge (let alone her collaboration), but ultimately with her full blessing and approval. In fact, she even wrote in her diary: \"Lo and behold, I found myself famous. I was much impressed. The play seemed to excite a breathless eagerness in the audience.\"Peake's play received unanimous praise. After a most successful season at London's Covent Garden, the whole company travelled to New York for a Broadway presentation in 1825. This also proved a triumph, with both critics and general theatregoers heaping particular praise on Thomas Potter Cooke who virtually stole the show with his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal of the silent monster, which Cooke played 400 times before the play finally closed. And for the next fifty years, Cooke coasted on his fame in numerous similar vehicles. Peake's play itself enjoyed countless revivals with some of the most famous actors of the day like Henry Irving playing the monster.Three of the differences between Shelley and Peake are really major: 1. In the novel, the monster not only speaks fluently, but has a most impressive vocabulary and eventually becomes quite verbose. In the play, Peake introduces a silent monster who can do no more than grunt. (Wow! So Thomas Potter Cooke, a well-known villain on the London stage in 1823, accepted a role that had no dialogue, yet played that role with such expertise, such understanding and such sympathy, he achieved instant fame)! 2. Peake gives Frankenstein a loyal, eager but not over-bright assistant named Fritz. In the novel, Frankenstein has no assistant at all. 3. The play, like this movie, features a detailed creation sequence; whereas the novel pays extremely scant attention to the actual creation of the monster. Indeed the whole episode is dismissed in a single vague paragraph!Now here's an interesting point. A friend sent me a photocopy of the theatre program for the 1927 adaptation by Peggy Webling at the Preston Theatre. This program acknowledges that Miss Webling's adaptation was based on both Shelley's 1818 novel and Peake's 1823 stage presentation! Yet, when Universal purchased the Webling play for the movies, somehow the ascription to Richard Brinsley Peake disappeared and has remained so to this very day.Finally, we come to the movie. First off, let me say it holds up remarkably well, particularly in Universal's fine DVD version which renders both Arthur Edeson's wondrous visuals and the movie's superlative sound effects in a manner that really duplicates the stunning impact of the movie's first season way back in 1931. Karloff, of course, is magnificent. His twisted, cruel, vicious portrait of a Monster who is still sympathetic despite it all, can never be dimmed by changes in acting styles or current fashions. (As is well-known, the part was first offered to Bela Lugosi who, having no knowledge of British theatre history, rejected it as soon as he discovered the role carried no dialogue\u0097a mistake that ruined his entire career and sent him quickly to Poverty Row. Karloff, on the other hand, knew of Peake's play, and more importantly he realized the Monster was actually the role of a lifetime. He not only seized it with both hands but, under Whale's gifted tutelage, brought it off superbly).Not to be outdone by the Monster, Whale cleverly cast his friend, Colin Clive, as Frankenstein. I know there are critics who regard Clive's performance as over the top, but I thought he was perfect. Clive rightly plays Frankenstein as a larger-than-life figure who refuses to allow his creation to dominate the action. After all, he is the Creator!Admittedly, John Boles makes a rather staid \"best friend\" (but after all, it's perfectly in character) and Mae Clarke could have made her heroine a bit more colorful, but the other support players led by Frederick Kerr (who renders some delightful comic relief in his role as the crotchety baron), Dwight Frye (as the hunchbacked little assistant), Marilyn Harris (as Maria, the charming little girl of the lake), Lionel Belmore (the self-important burgomaster) and of course curtain-raiser/doctor Edward Van Sloan are wholly endearing.Fortunately for the movie's present popularity, Whale's directorial technique with its meticulous attention to set dressing and special effects, plus its lavish use of dialogue close-ups interspersed with imaginatively shot and staged action material is now right back in fashion.Arthur Edeson's moodily atmospheric cinematography also enhances tension and terror, as do the heightened sound effects of this early (but definitely not dated) talkie. (One of these days, someone is going to write a book about Arthur Edeson. After all, he photographed four of the most popular movies of all time. The others on that list: All Quiet on the Western Front, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca)."], "tt0022028": ["Robert Grant is an American in the east who bears an uncanny resemblance to a Raja. When the Raja is killed by a tiger he was hunting Grant is forced to take his place so that the Raja's cousin won't seize the throne before the rightful heir can ascend. Unfortunately for Grant his friend Harris sells him out to the evil cousin because Grant refused to hold onto the throne and rape the country of all its wealth. What follows is a long chase as Grant tries to prove his innocence while disguised as an Arab (he's jailed for murder but escapes) and help the only one who knows who he really is find her brother who is being held captive until he relays the location of a diamond mine.Its a complex story that has more chapter breaks then cliffhangers. Shot partially silent this is a good looking serial that is an odd mix of locations that are nowhere near each other (Africa, India, the desert...). Despite not having a music score the film moves along reasonably well, even if the plot does tend to fold back on itself. The cast is pretty good with Boris Karloff one of the baddies looking for the diamond mine. Not the best, nor the worst but worth a look if you're in a forgiving mode, besides where else can you see an ape-man as a henchmen? It should be pointed out that the serial is what many would call racially insensitive. The portrayal of Arabs is mostly as villains and the black natives is of savages with bones through their noses.If you are offended by such portrayals, which were very much of the time this was made, look elsewhere.", "The longest chapter of course is the first at 32\u00bd minutes. But there is still a considerable variance in the two-reel chapters which range all the way from 21 minutes (6) to 16 minutes (10). Total running time: 248 minutes. U.S. release: March 1931. U.K. release: June 1931.Cut-down feature version (not released in the U.S.): BIMI.SYNOPSIS: The complex story-line involves a lot of folderol about a letter written by a dying Rajah (Miller) which exonerates a young American (also Miller) of his murder and accuses his plotting half- brother (Auer) and his accomplice (Santschi) instead. Matters are complicated by a young man's (Nye) discovery of a diamond mine which an Arab sheik (Karloff) covets. The sheik is joined by the free-booting accomplice (who brings along his obedient ape-man, McLaglen), a vamp (Christie), an animal trader (Potel), and a secret service agent (Lalande).NOTES: Locations outside Yuma, Arizona (desert scenes) and Bronson Canyon, North Hollywood. Interiors shot at Tec-Art Studios, Los Angeles. This was Mascot's third of 23 all-talking serials and was originally to star Harry Carey and Edwina Booth who both became unavailable when called back to M-G-M for re-takes on \"Trader Horn\".COMMENT: Although it's obvious right from the start that Martha Lalande is no old lady, we know she couldn't possibly be the man in dark glasses because both characters are on screen at the same time in at least two chapters. It does strain credulity a bit when it finally turns out...Never mind! Realism was never a Mascot virtue. Not that it matters when just about each episode \u2014 particularly numbers one through five \u2014 is so chock-a-block full of high-budget excitement. Six is the economy chapter. And there is a noticeable lessening of both pictorial splendors and thrills thereafter. But still plenty of derring-do, nonetheless.Miller makes an agile hero, but lacks the confidence he was later to assume as a serial heavy. His impersonations are little short of ridiculous, but we like him. Nora Lane, of course, makes a splendid heroine; whilst Santschi plays the villainous Harris to a \"T\". The big disappointment is Karloff, who acts his Mustapha as a try-out for the duplicitous rajah in some Amateur presentation of \"The Green Goddess\".Another letdown \u2014 though for the opposite reason \u2014 is provided by Dorothy Christie, that glorious vamp who is killed off at the end of Chapter Two. Let's hope she received an urgent call from M-G-M. Much as we like Miss Lane, the serial is the sorrier for Christie's absence.Direction is smooth, photography atmospheric.", "With everybody talking ever so slowly and in monotone speech, this is creakier than the soil above an open volcano. Cheaply made and rushed for the weekend matinee crowd, this has not stood the test of time well. Getting past stereotypes of Arabs and African natives, and even taking into account that the film is of the fantasy/adventure genre, this is difficult to get into and stay interested in. Even with some intentional stupid elements (Otto Hoffman in drag looking like a combination of Old Mother Riley and Whistler's Grandmother; a silly looking ape man mumbling everything but \"Ooga Booga!\"), this is nearly sleep inducing, not only to its idiotic plotting, but a tinny soundtrack practically music-less.American explorer Walter Miller is accused of murder and escapes from Ranjapur to the wilds of Africa where in 20 something chapters, he faces various challenges while trying to find the real killer and locate secret diamond fields among the blue clay, fighting wild animals, eluding his enemies and protecting Nora Lane, a young lady searching for her missing brother. How the outlandish old lady becomes involved in hiking across jungle and desert terrain is better left unexplained. This only had interest for me for the presence of Boris Karloff as the main villain, a stereotypical Arab, whose slow drawl and deep voice influences Miller when he disguises himself as an Arab. Badly read narration at the beginning of each episode doesn't even help recap how the previous chapter ended, since they each end jarringly and don't give really good cliffhangers in the first place. I'd like to find the edited feature length version which would get rid of all the fat and trim it down to a respectable length.", "This is another movie that I had never heard of until I was going through Letterboxd and it appeared on a list of horror films from 1931. Looking through this a bit, I was curious if it was going to be another one of those that is light on these elements or not. The other thing that struck me was the runtime. This is a serial that was shown in parts so binging it through like I did can make it problematic. To get into this synopsis, American adventurer Robert Grant (Walter Miller) is falsely accused of murdering an Indian noble and escapes to Africa in search of a diamond field and the real culprit.Much like the synopsis state, we're starting this in India where Robert is meeting with the just and kind ruler of Rajah (Miller). Robert is actually on a business trip it seems and he's trying to sell a machine to him. Rajah is more intrigued how close they look like each other despite being from different parts of the world. Robert is made an honored guest and joins them on a hunt. Things take a turn when a tiger attacks Rajah, fatally wounding him. Rajah wants Robert to pose as him until his brother can arrive. The reason being to convince Prince Dakka (Mischa Auer) nothing has happened and he doesn't usurp the throne.Robert confides in a hunter of Harris (Tom Santschi). He asks him to keep the secret and take the letter. Harris sees a chance to make money. He reveals to Prince Dakka the truth of Rajah in exchange for when Dakka is king, he will pay him a large sum of money. Rajah's brother shows up though before he takes the throne with soldiers. To prevent them from looking guilty, Robert is blamed for Rajah's death and he is taken to prison. What is keeping him going is him knowing the letter is out there that could clear his name. Harris wrote his contract with Dakka on the back of it and it was signed.Some years later, Robert breaks out of prison and is in the deserts of Algeria. He makes his way to Lobanga where he seeks out the aid of Mustapha (Boris Karloff). It is there he also meets the other important people to this story. Robert seeks the help of Mustapha to track down Harris and it turns out they're friends. Mustapha isn't to be trusted. Through Peterson (Victor Potel), they learn Tom Armitage (Carroll Nye) has discovered a diamond mine. They want to avoid government interference to get rich. Robert meets Tom's sister of Muriel (Nora Lane) and wants to keep them safe. Complicating it more are Mrs. LaSalle (Dorothy Christy) who Tom takes a liking to, Mrs. Colby (Otto Hoffman) who is a secret agent and even this mysterious man in black glasses. Harris also has trained an ape man by the name of Bimi (Arthur McLaglen) as a henchman.It becomes a dangerous game of cat and mouse with many twists and turns as Robert tries to clear his name, help out Muriel and her brother along with keeping Harris and Mustapha from getting this field of diamonds.That is where I'm going to leave my recap for this. To echo what I said in the start, this is a serial. It was broken up into shorts and there are 12 chapters for these. This is probably better suited to watch it with some gaps as it does get a bit repetitive to watch straight through like I did, especially when you have the recap at the beginning of each. I'm going to try to not hold this against it too much, but I wanted to point that out.Next I want to go into what I find interesting. This movie is listed as horror, but it is quite light on those elements. With the time this came out, I can see why it fell into the genre. What is pretty scary here is that there are a lot of instances where animals are attacking people. This is interesting to show how wild the area these events are happening. I also believe this is stock footage that is edited in and works well. Having man-eating animals is pretty horrific. There is also a tribe of Africans that hold our character hostages and hunt them as well. This includes some racist things that I will delve into a bit later, but it is scary if you are in that situation. I do think this is less horror than some movies that we question today, but it is a different time.Another genre that should be considered here is crime. Robert is accused of something that he didn't commit. He's spending most of this movie proving the truth. I like that for early scene, we are seeing him do some nefarious things to prove that. I'm assuming this is pre-code in order to show it. He is willing to go back to prison though, so that could also be their out. Much like him, Muriel and Tom are also our heroes here. I find it interesting that they are all white as well. Robert for most of this movie though is posing as an Arab to keep a low profile.The reason I brought up the last point though, Mustapha is presented as a character we can't trust. He is also an Arab here. I will say though Harris is white. Peterson, Mrs. Colby and the man in the black glasses are all white as well. I bring this up as we don't know if they are good or not throughout. I don't want to make this film out to be more racist than it is. It has it moments for sure, especially when dealing with the African tribe. Mustapha finds them to primitive and easily controlled. He's not wrong to an extent. They have a simpler lifestyle so some things they've not seen before sways them. I just don't like some of the language or how they are presented at times. The ape man of Bimi is another problem I have here. The movie doesn't explain his origins so I'm a bit more forgiving.Since I've taken such a look at the characters themselves, I will go next to the acting. I think that Miller is solid in both Robert and Rajah. I would have liked to see an actual Indian actor for the latter, but for the story it needs to be the same person. Lane is good as our female lead. I like how outgoing and strong she is. It is interesting that Tom takes a backseat to her as a character. Santschi is good as this sneaky hunter of Harris. Another problematic role is Mustapha. I really like Karloff. I think he's a great actor and he fits the role fine. It is a different time, but I still would have liked to see someone of Middle-Eastern roots playing the character. Potel, Auer, Hoffman, Nye and the rest are solid in their supporting roles. McLaglen as Bimi is also problematic, but I again am not going to hold it against the movie due to the minor back-story given.Next I want to go to the effects. For this movie, we really don't get a lot and being the era it is from they were done either practical in front of the camera or edited in. The stock animal footage is fine. I did find it funny that for some attack scenes with a lion, they actually used a lion rug to simulate it. I could tell it wasn't real or at least alive anymore, but it is creative in my opinion. The camera is pretty static, but I do feel they had some outdoor filming here which worked.In conclusion here, what I will say is that this is a solid serial. I personally don't know if it is made to be binged straight through like I did. Normally I'm not a fan to start negative, but this is a bit repetitive and that made it boring for me. There is still an interesting story and concept here, especially for early cinema. I think the acting is solid across the board. There are some problematic casting and things that are portrayed or said for me though. I would say that this is still an above average movie despite my issues with it."], "tt0022103": ["Warner Brothers were clearly eager to give the 1931 public what it wanted and also consolidate the success of SVENGALI made earlier that year by instantly reuniting the leads from that film \u2013 John Barrymore and Marian Marsh \u2013 in a quickly rehashed potboiler on similar lines. Barrymore is an embittered puppeteer whose lameness had dashed his dreams of a dancing career but, as fate would have it, is provided with the opportunity of living that glory vicariously through the agile street urchin he saves one day from the clutches of his cruel father (a small role for a pre-fame Boris Karloff). Growing up to be a peerless dancer (played by an uncharismatic Donald Cook) through the ruthless patronage of his foster father, he is ready to give it all up for the love of an innocent girl in the show (Marsh) but, needless to say, Barrymore will not let anything stand in the way of art and his ambitious plans for the prized pupil. Amusing sidekick Charles Butterworth helplessly looks on as Barrymore sadistically convinces dope-addicted choreographer (Luis Alberni) to fire Marsh but Cook overhears their heinous scheme and this causes a rift between impresario and prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Years pass but more scheming on Barrymore's part enables the estrangement of the lovers and the rekindling of the working relationship between father and son. Once again, however, fate intervenes with Barrymore eventually getting his just desserts at the hands of the distraught Alberni \u2013 on stage during the performance of what was to be Cook's crowning achievement! Admittedly, the plot is much inferior to that of SVENGALI but an unhinged Barrymore is always worth watching, Marsh is typically lovely while Michael Curtiz's expressionistic direction (his first of three notable forays in the genre) and Anton Grot's stylish sets lend the production a touch of class that keeps one watching if not exactly enthralled.", "In this interesting variation on the \"Svengali\" theme, JOHN BARRYMORE plays a crippled puppeteer with a club foot, who lives vicariously his dream of becoming a great dancer when he assumes responsibility for a runaway boy (FRANKIE DARRO) escaping the clutches of his cruel father (BORIS KARLOFF), well disguised with a thick Russian accent and wig that practically makes his features invisible.Michael Curtiz has directed with enormous help from Anton Grot's well designed sets and a generous use of background music at a time when it was rare for most films to feature so much music on the soundtrack. Of course, dealing with theatrical productions, this was totally necessary. In many ways, the film is way ahead of its time. Not only are the sets on a grand scale, but the B&W photography is richly detailed and Barrymore gives one of his most intense performances as the Svengali-like puppet master who finds he can't control his discovery once love enters the picture.Doll-faced MARIAN MARSH makes a lovely sort of \"Trilby\" character but DONALD COOK looks a bit uncomfortable in the role of Fedor, the dancer. The story is a little cumbersome in getting started, but once the plot starts spinning into high gear the suspense mounts and Curtiz stages all of the scenes involving theatrical productions in a manner that puts the film into the A-film category.Worth seeing for Barrymore's fascinating performance, Russian accent and all, and remarkable in that \"the talkies\" were only four years old when the film was made and the technical advances are obvious.", "When Michael Curtiz directed this odd ballet and horror film he presumably had the recent success of the John Barrymore - Marian Marsh film SVENGALI (from George Du Maurier's TRILBY) in mind. That story was based on a novel wherein a great singer is actually controlled (by hypnosis) by her impresario. Although Svengali's character in the novel was quite obnoxious, the film version softened it to make one realize he was in control of Trilby but loved her and could not be certain if she loved him back. In the end it turned out she did. The story of THE MAD GENIUS was similar - Donald Cook is a brilliant ballet dancer who was trained by impresario Barrymore, and the latter is determined to get his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 the career he deserves - by all means necessary. This means derailing anything or anyone who Barrymore concludes will prevent this. Marsh is a female member of the ballet company that Cook is falling for, and Barrymore is willing to push her out of the company, and even turn her into a wealthy nobleman's mistress to keep Cook in line.The film actually works. In the background was a misunderstanding of the relationship between Diaghilev and Nijinski (who many thought was that impresario's puppet). Here one realizes Barrymore is a man who is so hung up on the success of his adopted son that he does not stop even while he realizes he is doing harm to so many others. To perfect the boy's dancing (and the company's) he is willing to be the drug supplier to dance master Luis Alberni (one of the first examples of cocaine use in movies). When not pimping for his wealthy aristocratic backer, he runs a tight ship on all the dancers and his factotum associate Charles Butterworth. But he is human. One of the funniest aspects of the film is how Barrymore picks up his own sexual partners from starry eyed young woman coming in to join the ballet company. He always uses the same line with them, and even the same hour the next day to visit his office (three o'clock). Butterworth adds his bit too, as he tries constantly to interest Barrymore or anyone in a really bad ballet he's written (Barrymore, who is happy and drunk when Butterworth finally corners him, slowly sobers up when hearing this idiotic story line, and ends up saying he never realized what an ass Butterworth really was).Finally there is a cameo that I find fascinating. This is the film wherein Boris Karloff (for about one minute) shares screen time with John Barrymore. They never did so again.", "The Mad Genius is far from the best of John Barrymore's sound films. But it certainly provides a character for him to go full blast in terms of style and yet not seem overacted. Barrymore's plays a cripple who wanted to be a great ballet dancer, but only is confined to doing puppet shows with his sidekick Charles Butterworth.One day he and Butterworth rescue young Frankie Darro from a cruel father Boris Karloff. Barrymore sees in young Darro the promise and form of the dancer he wanted to be. This was before the Code so the homoerotic ideas in the scene are exploited to the max.Fast forward a dozen years and Darro is now Donald Cook at the top of his game as a ballet dancer, a veritable Nijinsky. He's also got eyes for pretty Marian Marsh, but so has Barrymore.Barrymore's years of training in the puppet theater have stood him in good stead as he's now a real puppet master, scheming and manipulating people to his will. His scene with Luis Alberni who is manager of the company to get him to do something he doesn't want to do is unforgettable. I won't reveal what he has over him, but this also was a subject later banned by the Code.Not the best of Barrymore's work, but it should provide a real introduction to his acting. And he's given great support by the ensemble Warner Brothers and director Michael Curtiz gave him.", "In another of John Barrymore's bizarre characterizations the great actor portrays a club-footed itinerant puppeteer who rescues an abused boy from vile existence,recognizes the lad's incredible of agility and footwork and begins to train the youngster to be a \"new\" Nijinsky.Years go by,the boy reaches manhood,and Barrymore the impresario of a successful ballet company.But when the ballet dancer begins to have ideas of his own,falls in love with pretty Marian Marsh,Barrymore,consumed with madness and jealousy attempts to manipulate their lives leading to shocking results. This extraordinary film oscillates between intriguing drama and moments of near horror with Barrymore in masterly control of his human puppets. Boris Karloff is the boy's monstrous father and Luis Alberni stands out as the drug-addicted ballet director.Magnificent direction by Michael Curtiz", "This film feels a little like a Tod Browning production, with John Barrymore in the role of a dark, twisted man that we could imagine Lon Chaney playing for Browning, but it's actually directed by Michael Curtiz. Barrymore leads a ballet troupe and jealously guards his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (Donald Cook), who he's raised from a boy since essentially stealing him from his abusive peasant father (Boris Karloff, briefly). He wants to use him to live out his own frustrated dreams of being a great dancer. He has no problem supplying the young man with lovers from the troupe, but doesn't want him to form any attachments, for fear it will impact his artistic abilities, and also of course because he's afraid of losing control. Enter Marian Marsh, a sweet young dancer who he falls in love with, thus setting up the central conflict in the film.When he's not busy trying to control the young man, Barrymore is up to no good elsewhere. He supplies drugs to his conductor (Luis Alberni), who is desperately addicted. He makes it clear to young ballerinas (Mae Madison and later Carmel Myers) that if they want to get ahead, they need to \"see him\" in his private office. He also berates his secretary (Charles Butterworth, who provides some comic relief with his bumbling), responding to one of his ideas by saying \"It's incredible. It's unbelievable... that there should be any human being living who is such a stupid ass.\" Barrymore is excellent throughout the film and turns in a performance that dominates, though Cook and Marsh are reasonably good as well. The brief segments of ballet scenes, often in practice, show realistic and solid dancing.The film starts strong, but loses a little bit of its steam in the second half, and not completely living up to its potential. The direction from Curtiz is great, with creative shot angles and editing, but the plot is a little simple. It's hard to believe I'd say that a film with open drug use, predatory sexual behavior, and an axe murder wouldn't be dark enough, and yet, somehow I wanted more. Maybe I've been watching too many pre-code movies lately.", "I've always liked the John Barrymore/Marian Marsh film \"Svengali\" and have always wanted to see Warner Brothers' re-teaming of the two in \"The Mad Genius\". Thankfully, Ted Turner seems to own it and shows a very nice print of it on TCM. I've got it recorded and I like to watch it now and again. Although it's not a favorite of mine like \"Svengali\" is, \"The Mad Genius\" is still a film that I enjoy. Tsarakov (Barrymore) rescues a small boy from his abusive father (Boris Karloff). As the years pass the boy, Fedor (Donald Cook), grows up to become a seasoned ballet dancer and Tsarakov is the ballets impresario. Tsarakov pampers every move in Fedor's life; getting him leads in ballets and encouraging him to have a steady supply of young women lovers. However, Fedor loves Nana (Marian Marsh) and Tsarakov, seeing this as the ruination of Fedor's career, forces Nana to take up with Count Renaud (Andr\u00e9 Luget), a good-natured, understanding man. Will Fedor and Nana reunite? What will happen to Tsarkov? Watch \"The Mad Genius\" and you'll find out. You may marvel at the films casual pre-code approach to sex. Very good film, but not as charming as the classic \"Svengali\".", "This film is an ideal companion piece to Barrymore's other mad manipulator \"Svengali\". It is just as eerie but unfortunately all but unavailable on the video market. I saw it one time on the late show and it stayed with me all my life. It is really an exaggeration of the relationship between impresario Diaghilev and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nijinski but it also inspired (is there a better word?) the Powell-Pressburger ballet epic \"The Red Shoes\". Funny how one story gets around...", "This movie was so obviously an attempt by Warners to cash in on John Barrymore's earlier \"Svengali\", they even reunited a lot of the cast - Barrymore, Marian Marsh, Carmel Myers and Luis Alberni. This movie was to ballet what \"Svengali\" was to opera, purportedly based on the relationship between Diaghilev and Nijinsky, although in reality Nijinsky had already created a stir in the ballet world before he met Diaghilev.John Barrymore gets a chance to play another \"warped\" genius and his performance dominates the film, without him it would be just a forgettable romance played out against a ballet background. This time he is a crippled puppeteer who, as a child, was rejected by his ballerina mother because of his clubfoot. Since then he has crushed his dreams and now runs a traveling marionette circus. When he gives shelter to a village boy, Fedor, (Frankie Darro) who is hiding from his cruel father (Boris Karloff), Tsarakov (Barrymore) vows \"I will make him the greatest dancer of all time\"!!! and within 15 years, Fedor (now played by Donald Cook) has taken the ballet world by storm. You definitely don't see Cook perform many intricate steps but he handles the dramatic part of the story okay. Tsarakov is now manager of a \"Ballet Russe\" (shades of Diaghilev) but behind his kindly uncle demeanor is an evil tyrant who manipulates people through their own weaknesses.Fedor is in love with the beautiful Nana (Marsh) but that does not fit in with Tsarakov's plans and he plots to have Nana expelled from the company. He forges a letter and forces drug addicted choreographer Bankieff (Luis Alberni) to sign - or he will withhold the drugs that he knows Bankieff craves. His plan backfires however and Fedor and Nana run away together, Fedor getting a job in a seedy cafe (a rare chance to hear Cole Porter's \"You've Got That Thing\") and sinking into a depression when he realises that ballet is in his blood. There is an interesting plot development when Fedor starts to exhibit the same characterizations as Tsarakov, in his voice and speech but apart from a couple of characters remarking on it, it doesn't go anywhere. It all ends in a completely melodramatic way that would have pleased Barrymore no end.In a 1985 Films in Review article, Marian Marsh recalled the happy memories she had of working with Barrymore. He was enjoying a period of great calm, he was happily married to Dolores Costello, he wasn't drinking (much) and his wife and little daughter \"Dee Dee\" often visited him on the set. Miss Marsh said that far from being \"the Great Actor\" he was very kind to her and helped her in her craft.", "In \"The Mad Genius\" John Barrymore delivers one of his most enjoyable screen performances, playing a club-footed, alcoholic, womanizing Russian puppeteer who takes an abused youth under his wing and molds him into a great star with the Ballet Russe, an accomplishment he could never attain himself due to his deformity. Some may consider his performance hammy, but at least it's Grade A.The film opens expressionistically somewhere in \"Central Europe\" on a rain-drenched night with Barrymore and his dim-witted sidekick (the deadpan Charles Butterworth) rehearsing a traveling puppet show when a barefoot youth (Frankie Darro), fleeing a beating from his insanely sadistic father (Boris Karloff), stumbles into their tent. Barrymore and Butterworth hide him and leave town in a horse-drawn wagon shot at a tilted angle as it creaks along a muddy road.Zip to Berlin several years later. The youth is now a young man (Donald Cook) who is in love with a fellow dancer (Marian Marsh). Barrymore, still the puppeteer but of humans now, wants no one interfering with his controlling relationship and maneuvers Marsh out of the company while elevating a lesser dancer to her position. Meanwhile, Barrymore's dance director (Luis Alberni) is slowly going mad from a cocaine addiction enabled by his employer. The two are locked together, feeding on each other's weaknesses, paralleling the central relationship between teacher-mentor and star-prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Barrymore needs Alberni's skills as a dance master; Alberni can't function without the drugs Barrymore provides.The camera often shoots from low angles, with ceilings visible. Lots of chiaroscuro. Pre-Code subject matter includes extramarital cohabitation, prostitution, drug addiction, and (for the time) grisly violence. Suggestive dialogue abounds.Barrymore feasts on the role. Luis Alberni plays the frenzied addict to the hilt. Marian Marsh and Donald Cook are sometimes mechanical and artificial but not to the extent that they undermine their roles and both have strong moments. Carmel Myers is excellent in a brief drunken scene with Barrymore.Donald Cook looks so much like the Warners contract actress Kay Francis that they should have been cast in a movie together as siblings. Just sayin'.", "This Follow-Up to Svengali (1931) is a Similar Story, the Lush Art-Deco Production and the Stylish Direction from Michael Curtiz makes this a more Sprawling and Grander Film, but perhaps, not a better one.There are Many Highlights of Pre-Code Daring that are Evident throughout Dealing with Drug Addiction (Cocaine), Sex, and a number of Scantily Clad Dancers (mostly dancers warming up) and Spicy Dialog with Innuendos Galore. A Bloody Axe-Wielding Ending with a \"Phantom of the Opera\" Feel and to Lighten things now and then, Charles Butterworth's Smooth Talking Nonsensical Dolt.There's Boris Karloff, a heartbeat before Frankenstein (1931), in a very Small but Noticeable Role as a Sadistic Child Abuser, and Marion Marsh as a Doll-Faced Dancer that can Light Up the Screen.John Barrymore's Lead Performance is Captivating Evil and Playful at the same time. Donald Cook is the Love Interest. Barrymore's \"Golem\" is OK but Unremarkable.Overall, the Film is Rich with Ingredients as it Globe Hops and most of the Money (evident On Screen) was Not Recovered at the Box Office Forcing WB to Cancel Barrymore's Pricey Contract.Definitely Worth a Watch for Movie-Buffs, Pre-Code Enthusiasts, Art-Deco Fans, and Early Sound Techniques. The Look of the Movie is Outstanding.", "THE MAD GENIUS (Warner Brothers, 1931), directed by Michael Curtiz, reunites the cast of John Barrymore, Marian Marsh, Luis Alberni and Carmel Myers from their previous effort of SVENGALI (1931), directed by Archie Mayo. With SVENGALI being a classic by today's standards, with frequent television revivals and availability on both video cassette and DVD, THE MAD GENIUS is virtually forgotten and almost unknown. Not quite a horror film as the title implies, making one think of Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi, who specialized in playing mad doctors as such, THE MAD GENIUS, from the play \"The Idol\" by Martin Brown, very well depicts that of its leading actor, John Barrymore, who is not only mad, but obsessed in helping another become a popular ballet dancer, a possession he wanted for himself but unable to achieve, only to live his life for another.PROLOGUE: Locale: Central Europe; Time: Fifteen years ago; Scene: A peasant village. As Vladimir Ivan Tsarakov (John Barrymore) and his partner, Karimsky (Charles Butterworth), work on puppets hung on strings doing ballet images, at a near distance, both men witness a brutal father (Boris Karloff) whipping and chasing after his son (Frankie Darro). Falling unconscious due to a fall, the boy is assisted and properly hidden away by Vladimir and Karrimsky, forcing the father to go away when the boy is unable to be found. Seeing the youngster's run and jumping over high fences to avoid his father finds Ivan, whose handicap is his club foot, believing the boy, under his guidance, can become a successful ballet dancer. Almost immediately, the men take their horse and wagon to another destination. THE STORY: Locale: Berlin; Time: Present; Scene: Staatsoper. Now a young man, Feodor (Donald Cook), who has grown to love and respect Ivan as his guide and protector, has become a ballet dancer performing opposite Nana Carlova (Marian Marsh), whom he has grown to love. Because of their relationship, Ivan tries to break them up by firing Nana. Feodor overhears what's going on and leaves Ivan's company, taking Nana with him. Unable to succeed on his own in cabarets, and practically living in poverty, Nana comes to Ivan to have him take Feodor back with him, but will do so if she would do something very much against her wishes. Also in the supporting cast are: Luis Alberni (Serge Bankieff); Andre Luget (Count Robert Renard); Mae Madison (Olga Checkova); and Lee Moran (The Cabaret Director). Carmel Myers as Sonya assumes a smaller role as she did in SVENGALI where she plays a woman who wants but loses the affections of the impresario, Barrymore, while Boris Karloff, receiving no cast credits for his role, is virtually unrecognizable for his few minutes on screen playing an abusive father, yet its his familiar voice that gives him away.Through nowhere in the same league as SVENGALI, where Marian Marsh was the center of attention, THE MAD GENIUS holds it own in a different light. Marsh's role here, introduced 13 minutes into the story with camera focusing on her ballet dancing feet, isn't much of a main focus as she was in the previous film, that actually going to Donald Cook. Cook seems miscast as a ballet dancer, though some dancing scenes depicted are naturally captured in long shot performed by a stunt double, only using Cook's face in closeup for mood reactions. Barrymore, on the other hand, assumes his obsession on his protege, Cook, as he did as the hypnotist, Svengali, for Marion Marsh's Trilby, and excels in it. As with SVENGALI where Barrymore sports a pointy beard, for his MAD GENIUS, is pointy beard style only appears on bis bottom chin. The only moment of comedy used for THE MAD GENIUS is the support given by Charles Butterworth where his tells him some long-winded story that has the Barrymore character trying desperately to stay awake, calling him an \"ass\" when the story is completed, otherwise THE MAD GENIUS is straight drama, with shadowy images, haunting score, and some fine staged dance sequences provided. For Barrymore's final film for the Warner Brothers studio, THE MAD GENIUS, which followed SVENGALI (interesting both clocked at 81 minutes) are fine exits for his unusual acting talent.Never distributed on video cassette, but available on DVD (though this would make a good companion piece on DVD on the flip side of SVENGALI), THE MAD GENIUS is shown occasionally on Turner Classic Movies cable channel. (***)", "There is a story that has since become part of Hollywood folklore that Boris Karloff, still a relatively unknown supporting player, was summoned to the office of director Michael Curtiz.  The Hungarian expatriate took one look at the slender, soft spoken Englishman and allegedly said \"Good God, you're not Russian!  I sent for you because your name is Karloff.  It certainly sounds Russian!  Oh well, now that you're here I guess I'll have to use you.\"  It seems like a lot to go through for a role that lasts about 2 minutes onscreen and was probably completed in 1 day but Boris got the part anyway. In truth, Boris is so convincing hidden behind a beard and using a Russian accent that many people do not realise it is him!  In those pre-FRANKENSTEIN days you could also spot Karloff in THE YELLOW TICKET in which he has no lines at all; or in THE PUBLIC DEFENDER where he is quite noticeable; or even CRACKED NUTS where he appeared opposite comedians Wheeler and Woolsey.  It was not long after THE MAD GENIUS that director James Whale asked Karloff to test for, as he (Whale) put it, \" . . .a damned awful monster.\"  The rest, as they say, is history. Frankie Darro, whose role is almost as small as Boris', had already costared with Rin Tin Tin Sr in THE LIGHTNING WARRIOR (1930) and would meet up with Rinty Jr in THE WOLF DOG (1934).", "John Barrymmore plays a puppeteer who takes in a small boy who grows to be a great dancer. Things get dicey when the boy's eye strays from dancing toward one girl in particular.Intrguing pre-code film that, at times, has Barrymore giving a great performance. Watch his early scenes and you'll see just how good he was. During bits later in the film he seems to be phoning it in but he's still a joy to behold. The movie itself is a potboiler in the Svengali mode, but it's entertaining. I love the ballet sets which are decidedly of the time the film was made.Worth a peak.", "Although not quite as good as Svengali, this follow-up with John Barrymore and Marian Marsh from that film isn't too shabby. Barrymore stars as puppeteer with a bum leg who fancies himself a ballet impresario, discovering a kid with athletic spirit he feels is perfect for what he envisions as the vessel for all his creative energies. Donald Cook is the grown-up Fedor, now an undeniable ballet talent thanks to Barrymore's Vladimir Tsarakov, on marquees heading extravagant stage presentations. Along with loyal and put-upon assistant, Karimsky (Charles Butterworth), Vladimir has shaped and molded the ballet superstar he always wanted to be but his crippled leg wouldn't let him in Fedor. All that could be jeopardized by a female dancer, Nana (Marsh, just a doll), who Vladimir considers a bad influence, with him purposely on the manipulative attack, using whatever psychological tactics his devious, jealous mind could muster. Honestly I could barely recognize Karloff as the abusive peasant father chasing after Fedor when he was a kid, with Vladimir hiding him from harm. The sets, especially the stage houses and operas, are impressive, but Barrymore bugging his eyes, liquoring up and womanizing when able, is once again incredible...a charismatic powerhouse who plays this monster seeing himself a god having created a perfect specimen he feels will be corrupted by Nana to the hilt. Barrymore's alcoholism might have robbed him ultimately from a lucrative career, but this and Svengali offer us rich examples of colorful human beasts, doing whatever it takes to control or destroy those that possibly disrupt his plans. Michael Curtiz's direction may not necessarily command the same attention as future Warner Bros horror pictures like Doctor X or Mysteries of the Wax Museum, but he still knows how to frame faces and delve his cast into the macabre. This film includes a drug addict who trains the performers and is shaken when Vladimir demands he remove Nana from a starring role...precode Hollywood was once quite daring with these kinds of characters. The way Vladimir torments Nana and Fedor's suffering after Vladimir blacklists make up some real dramatic weight in this film. A gem worth seeking out.", "I quite enjoyed this one when I first saw it many years ago, but it doesn't stand up well. Barrymore is the main problem. His is a ranting, self-glorifying, drown out everyone else in the cast performance, which, to my surprise, director Mike Curtiz indulges rather than trying to keep a lid on it. And I don't know that it was a good idea of the screenwriters not only to keep so much of the moribund stage play in the action, thus slowing it down, and then pandering Barrymore with long speeches, and thus slowing things down even further. Director Mike Curtiz seems to be in awe of Barrymore and favor him with eye- rolling close-ups and long takes at the expense of other members of the cast, especially Marian Marsh. In fact some of our favorite people have very little footage, including Boris Karloff who makes a significant entrance and then totally disappears. We do see a lot of Donald Cook, however, despite the fact that he is, at best, a rather stodgy, humdrum actor with \u2013 at least in this movie \u2013 little in the way of charisma. I'm not surprised the movie failed dismally at the box office. Sometimes, not often, mind you, audiences showed good taste! This movie is available on very good Warner Brothers DVD, but with no extras, alas!", "Firstly, this is nothing like SVENGALI. Apart from the same cast and art director, this is completely different. Secondly it's really rather dull.Besides a cracking episode of ANGEL (Waiting in the Wings), the most similar story to this is the section in the 1940 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE where Vivienne Leigh is a struggling ballerina bullied by Mdm. Olga. Here John Barrymore does a pretty decent job of playing the role Mara Ouspenskaya did as the tyrannical principal of a ballet troupe. The problem is that in WATERLOO BRIDGE that was a ten minute section of the film - in this, that's all the film is. There's just not enough story to fill out an hour and a half.Crippled John Barrymore vicariously lives out his own dream of being a great dancer through a young man he discovers. He is so manically driven that he won't let anything, including this dancer falling in love, deviate him from his plan for him to be the world's greatest ballet dancer. If this young dancer or the girl he loves were in any way interesting characters this might itself be an interesting film but it transpires that they are Hollywood's dullest couple. You simply couldn't care less about them so just want this tedium to end (possibly to then go and search out that old episode of ANGEL?)It's no surprise that this picture performed so badly at the box office. It was rushed into production following the moderate success of SVENGALI a few months earlier and you can tell it's a rush job. Warners just wanted to cash in by making something which looked, as least in terms of visuals, the same. Whereas SVENGALI had an annoyingly stupid story with lazy direction, this was directed a little better but didn't even have a story.", "I feel like no other decade seems to have as many obscure gems lost to time as the 1930's; case in point, The Mad Genius. Coming out in the same year as the iconic adaptations of Frankenstein, Dracula, and Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde; but in my humble opinion, The Mad Genius is a better and more intriguing film than any of those.The opening of The Mad Genius does a superb job at setting a time and place; central Europe in the early 20th century. There is an impeccable level of detail in creating the world of a traveling performer; with the falling of the rain, the wind and the sound of horse and carriage taking full advantage of sound technology to create a world. Equally as impressive is Vladimar Ivan Tsarakov's (John Barrymore) Berlin theatre and the large-scale stage set with hints of German expressionism throughout and the widespread use of music in the soundtrack, unlike other early talkies.John Barrymore is (unsurprisingly) mesmerising as Vladimar Ivan Tsarakov (quite a name), one of the most repulsive characters he ever played as he spends the movie spewing pompous and at times mad scientist like dialogue. He has a misogynistic attitude towards women and is even seen ogling up the skirts of his dancers, in one of the film's very pre-code elements. He is even a drug dealer, although the word drug is never used in the film nor is it identified what substances appear in the film. In one scene in which he refuses to deal drugs with the stage director played by Luis Alberni, I love his summary on drugs when he throws them into the fire; \"If I drop this, you will be free, but you will suffer of course, but in the end, you will be happier than you could ever dream\". Likewise In one of the movie's comic highlights, there is an early use of profanity in the film; \"It's unbelievable that there's any human being living, who should be such a stupid ass\".One of the many interesting observations in The Mad Genius is the combination of elements from other movies. The plot itself is derivative of Barrymore's previous horror outing Svengali, while Tsarakov's desire to create a great ballet dancer out of a young boy is a variation on Dr. Frankenstein (which the movie itself alludes to). When Tsarakov is wearing on overcoat he is bent over like Quasimodo; Barrymore's facial appearance is very similar to that of Bela Lugosi in White Zombie, likewise, his voice is reminiscent of Lugosi's Dracula. The theatre setting has vibes of The Phantom of the Opera and perhaps most interestingly are the elements of The Red Shoes with the film's inclusion of ballet and the themes of going to extremes for one's art. Could Powell and Pressburger have taken inspiration from The Mad Genius?", "John Barrymore had some wonderful performances over his film career. But, he also had some really terrible performances as well--ones which were far from subtle and terribly overacted. One of these embarrassingly bad performances was his famous \"Svengali\" and another was the follow-up film, \"The Mad Genius\". In fact, both performances seem just about identical--with Barrymore playing essentially the same sort of guy--a creepy manipulator who is troll- like and with a thick, thick accent. The plot of \"Svengali\" involves a creepy guy using his hypnotic-like powers to bend a woman to his will and make her a star. Here, it's a guy instead...but otherwise it's the same 'ol same 'ol.The bottom line is the film lacks subtlety and originality. While it might have played well back in the day, today it just seems very dated and dumb. Barrymore was capable of so much better than this and the film is extremely difficult to finish.", "The Mad Genius (1931)*** (out of 4)Vladimar Ivan Tsarakov (John Barrymore) dreamed of becoming a world famous dancer but a club foot prevented that from happening. One day he notices a young boy being abused so he takes the kid as his own with the plan of turning him into a great star. As an adult, Fedor (Donald Cook) begins to rise to stardom as Vladimar's obsession grows stronger and more deranged.Obviously this here was meant as a version of SVENGALI, which was released earlier in the same year as this picture. In all honesty, I've always thought that film was somewhat overrated but it was saved thanks to the great performance by Barrymore. It took me a long time to track down a copy of THE MAD GENIUS and I must admit that I felt the same about this film as I did about SVENGALI.THE MAD GENIUS isn't a bad movie but at the same time, outside of the performances, there's really nothing overly special about the film and I might even argue that it's pretty darn boring at times. I really didn't think the usually great Michael Curtiz brought any style or substance to the material. I was a little surprised that the screenplay spends so much time with characters just sitting around talking. A lot of the more horror-like elements are drained of any sort of suspense or drama.As I said, the reason the film remains watchable is due to the performances with Barrymore once again leading the way. I really thought he was great here in a rather restraint role. I mean, we're used to the theatrical Barrymore really going wild but that wasn't the case here. He was brilliant at using his eyes to tell and show us what madness was beneath this character. I also thought Marian Marsh was good in her role of the love interest and Cook is also good, if a bit bland, in his role. Charles Butterworth nearly steals the picture with his comic timing in the role as Karimsky.As I said, there are quite a few flaws to be found in THE MAD GENIUS but the cast and performances are just so good that you can't help but stay with the picture.", "Stars John Barrymore and Charles Butterworth as a team of performing puppeteers. They see a man whipping a child, and come to his rescue. and yes, that's the monster-master Boris Karloff, as the boy's terrible father we see right at the opening. Some elaborately staged scenes, with large casts of uncredited roles, as they choreograph dance numbers on stage. Butterworth had a dry, sarcastic, under-stated humor, and had a career in Broadway before entering film. Has an interesting bio here on imdb... died quite young in a car crash. While wikipedia.org states it was an accident, imdb claims it may be been intentional. The story shows a russian cast putting together a show in berlin. Trials, tribulations, ups, downs, love triangles. Lots of talk... proving that this started out as a play. It's okay. Directed by Michael Curtiz, who had started out in the silent films, as had Barrymore and Karloff. Curtiz' best known work was probably the oscar winning Casablanca in 1944 !", "Taped this picture on the late-late-late movie channel on the NY TV stations and have never seen it again.  John Barrymore(Tsarakov) plays a crippled, half-mad puppeteer, who yearns to dance.  Upon saving the young boy Fedor(Frankie Darro) from his foster father's (Boris Karloff) abuse, he recognizes the youth's ability and hopes to make him a famous dancer. Karloff's role was very minor, and he did not reappear after the opening sequence.  There was a mention of Frankenstein in the script where it refers about a Golem fashioned from mud and given a human soul and is asked by Tsarakov \" Frankenstein's man?   John Barrymore dominates the entire screen, but they still need Karloff to bring the 193l audiences into the movie houses.", "Here is another movie that I never heard of until I was looking through Letterboxd for all of the horror movies released in the year of 1931. This one intrigued me when I saw that it starred John Barrymore as well as Marian Marsh, as they starred together in another horror film from this year of Svengali. So aside from that information, I came into this one blind with just having read the synopsis right before starting it. That synopsis is a crippled man finds a boy and vows to make him a great dancer.The prologue here is Central Europe and 15 years in the past. Vladimar Ivan Tasarakov (Barrymore) is a puppeteer and he works with Karimsky (Charles Butterworth). He's quite mean to him as well. Watching them is a boy by the name of Fedor (Frankie Darro) as they practice. Their puppet show is part of a traveling group. They're interrupted when Fedor's father shows up, scolding and whipping him. His father is played by an uncredited role of Boris Karloff. Fedor gets away and Ivan is impressed with how graceful he is. He ends up hiding the boy and when they leave, he comes with them.We then shift to the present in Berlin. Ivan's mother was a famous Russian ballet dancer, but he was born crippled, making him unable to dance. This upset her and she ended up leaving him while he was a child. This is quite scarring. Ivan saw the potential in Fedor (Donald Cook) and trained him to be the best. He is now one of the greatest dancers in Europe. Fedor is interested in Nana Carlova (Marsh). Ivan is fine with them being together as long as Fedor doesn't fall in love. He needs his release, but falling for her will ruin his career according to Ivan. He even rebuffs the advances of Count Robert Renaud (Andr\u00e9 Luguet) who is interesting in Nana, wanting to ensure that Fedor is always happy.When Ivan learns that his prized pupil has fallen for Nana, he wants her to leave the production and marry Count Renaud though. He believes love will make people do bad things, at least to what he wants. This upsets Fedor who threatens to quit dancing if she is sent away. He has to make a decision, leave the only thing he knows how to do for the love of his life where he will be black-balled by his father figure or play pawn to this mastermind in Ivan.That is where I'm going to leave my recap as that is really the main story of this movie. There are some deep seeded things with characters under this and that is where I'm going to start. The character of Ivan is interesting. He always wanted to be a dancer and part of this is the fact that his mother was bothered by his affliction. He's been harboring that and sees his chance to live through Fedor. Ivan's mother abandoning him is bad and kidnapping Fedor is as well. Aside from that, wanting to give Fedor a good life is a good thing. It is when he is manipulating those around him to continue to be successful is where this becomes an issue.Seeing the title of this movie, I figured this would be a mad scientist film. I was pleasantly surprised that we are dealing with someone being very intelligent, but in a different sort of way. Ivan manipulates everyone he encounters to an extent. Nana he tries to send away multiple times. He is mean to Karimsky and bosses him around. Fedor is a character he doesn't necessarily do anything toward directly, but tries to remove obstacles without his knowledge. Sergei Bankieff (Luis Alberini) is the stage manager for his productions and he actually uses drugs to control him. I'm assuming it is opium from the paper it is kept in. He also lies to Sonya Preskoya (Carmel Myers) and Olga Chekova (Mae Madison), who are both dancers that want to be famous. There is also a bit with Count Renaud as well. It is interesting how his conduct leads to his downfall in the end.Since there isn't much to the story and more to the interactions, I'll go to the acting next. Barrymore is really good as Ivan. I like how he plays the character and I believe he could be this mastermind. Marsh is cute and I feel bad for what she has to decide to do for the betterment of Fedor's life. Butterworth adds some levity. I feel bad for him though. Cook is solid as Fedor who has people being used around him to influence his decisions. I'd say from there that Alberini, Myers, Luguet and the rest round this out for what was needed.Then really the last thing to bring up here would be the cinematography, effects and the musical selections. I would say that the cinematography is fine. We are getting some interesting looks at the ballet as they are rehearsing. I'm glad they didn't focus on this too much though. It would have felt like filler if they did. This really isn't a movie that has much in the way of effects and the soundtrack also fits for what was needed. It just doesn't necessarily stand out to me.In conclusion here, this is going to be a bit shorter of a review, but that is mostly due to a simple story. That isn't to say it is bad though. This movie is really focused on the acting which I think is good across the board. It is interesting to see this concept of a mad genius like Ivan who is living through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and seeing what he does to keep this golden goose working for him. I'd say that the technique here of filmmaking is fine. This is quite light in the horror elements, but it makes sense for the era. I would say though that this is movie is over average for me. It is lacking though to go any higher than that personally.", "A crippled puppeteer (John Barrymore) tries to control the life of of a dancer (Donald Cook) he discovered and trained.A follow up to his earlier 1931 film Svengali, The Mad Genius more than lives up to its title. It's absurdly pre-code: there's drug use, swearing, prostitution and a brutal axe murder. Barrymore is fantastic; he bugs his eyes out and has an absurd Russian accent (he's the only cast member to try an accent).Charles Butterworth provides good comic relief, and Luis Alberni is good as the drug-addled stage choreographer. Mariah Marsh and Donald Cook are a bit wooden as the co-leads.Michael Curtiz's direction is excellent. There's several nice directorial choices, such as showing the aforementioned axe murder only in shadow. Boris Karloff appears in an uncredited role in the beginning.Don't miss this one. First time viewing. 3.5/5", "This film features John Barrymore as a monomaniacal angel of destruction. When he sees a young boy exhibiting great grace and dexterity, chased and beaten by a horrible father (Boris Karloff) he rescues him. As a two bit puppeteer he decides to set the boy on stage as a dancer (and it works). But Barrymore has no guile or gentleness. He doesn't believe an artist can be successful with distraction. The boy, now a man, falls for a pretty ballerina and his surrogate father destroys the relationship. But the acting is bad and the kid doesn't seem to have much dramatic talent, although the film promotes him as great. They should have cast an actual dancer. It's kind of silly at times but certainly interesting."], "tt0022173": ["... in this thriller that combines the atmosphere of the Universal horror films of the 1930's with the feel of the sophisticated precodes of Paramount. This is a rare chance to see Lilyan Tashman in a leading role, and she is spot on as a woman who wants wealth and comfort by any means possible and sees her ability to manipulate men to do her bidding as key to her plan.Our story opens as does the film Frankenstein from this same year - 1931 - in a foggy graveyard with a group of mourners gathered around a grave. Into the scene strolls old Mrs. Endicott with her maid and son to visit the family crypt. However, honoring the dead is not her purpose, instead she is there to insure that her own crypt is in working order. Mrs. Endicott has a fear of being buried alive and has a creepy sounding horn installed in her own vault so that if she is erroneously interred she can sound the alarm and be rescued. Thus she likes to try it out from time to time to see if it still works.The Endicotts are apparently a family whose tree has deep and wealthy roots but withering leaves. There are only two possible heirs to the Endicott fortune in that tree - Mrs. Endicott's brutish idiot son Philip and her alcoholic weakling of a nephew, Herbert. Philip has made it clear that his highest goal in life is to kill people with his bare hands, so Mrs. Endicott leaves her fortune to her nephew. Philip has enough IQ points to know he's been supplanted and is upset about the situation, and Herbert is happy because now he hopes his wife Laura (Lilyan Tashman) will stop nagging him about money now that she can know her future is secure.The night that the new will is drawn up and signed Mrs. Endicott is strangled to death. Soon after the funeral, Herbert and Laura take up residence in the Endicott ancestral home, Herbert is strangled as well. Shortly after that the alarm from Mrs. Endicott's tomb rings out. What's going on here? Watch and find out. There are secret passages, shadowy figures in the fog, and best of all Ms. Tashman, making Jezebel look like Betty Crocker. William Stage Boyd plays police lieutenant Valcour who is trying to get to the bottom of all of this. Will he succumb to Lilyan's poisonous poise, or will he solve the crime? Remember that this is the precode era and unjust outcomes were allowed and did occur in American film during this time.I highly recommend this one for anybody who likes the old dark house films of the 30's.", "I was captured from the opening scene which takes place in a murky old Gothic style graveyard...then we move on to inside the tombs! Yeah, this is a good one. It's borderline horror with a large cast of weird characters, an excellent evil, evil woman, and all kinds of cool vintage strangeness. In one scene a corpse in disinterred to make certain she is really dead(yeah). Then an old woman sits holding said corpse which was dead and had been for awhile. A detective looks at the body and says...\"yeah, she's cold as ice,\" WHOA! The actor who plays the super strong Quasimodo type dude was terrific as were most of the cast. This is one you don't want to miss. Find it, along with MURDER AT DAWN, if you are a fan of vintage horror or suspense. Its not really a mystery because you find out who did it right away. Tons of fun with this one! They don't make them like this anymore...and probably never will. Great lighting too.", "Creaky murder mystery about the unnatural death of the matriarch of a family and the attempt of the heirs to stay out of jail. A rather complex tale the film demands attention because so much is going on. Full of over ripe performances this is the sort of movie that they don't do any more. Its perfect late night viewing especially with the great sets of the manor house , grave yard, secret passages and other strange things, this is a film that takes you to a dark and creaky place. That said I don't think the film is anything other than good. As I said the over ripeness of it kind of diminishes the quality, but at the same time its got mood to burn. Worth a look for a dark and stormy late night.", "This is a superb horror/thriller that soaked up the atmosphere from the new cycle of eerie and atmospheric horror films that were taking the movie public by storm. The stars were Lilyan Tashman in a sleek \"Lady Macbeth\" type role and William \"Stage\" Boyd as Lt. Valcour.Julia Endicott (Blanche Frederici), Miss Roberts (Martha Mattox) and Julia's imbecile son Phillip (Irving Pichel) come to pay their respects to Phillip's father in a magnificent family crypt. Visually it is very impressive, along with Karl Struss' superb camera work. Julia has a fear of being buried alive, so she has had a horn installed that is heard throughout the movie whenever a murder is about to take place. Irving Pichel is wonderful as the scary and menacing Phillip.Herbert Endicott (Walter McGrail) is on a visit to his aunt but in the cab he is being grilled by Laura,(Lilyan Tashman) his wife, who wants him to claim his inheritance. Julia decides to leave all her money to Herbert and not Phillip - but Herbert and Laura must live in the house as one of the conditions of the will. Once they are installed in the house Julia is murdered and Phillip, with his obsesssion with knives and death by strangulation is instantly arrested. Lt. Valcour (William \"Stage\" Boyd) is not convinced - he thinks more attention should be given to Mr. and Mrs. Endicott. At the funeral Valcour sees Laura holding hands with Jimmy, her lover (Lester Vail) and knows he is on the right track.Herbert, who is the real murderer, is stricken with conscience and wants to go to the police. Laura then pays a visit to Philip - getting him all hot and bothered - and proposes that if she were only free, they, (Laura and Phillip) could live happily in the old house together. Suddenly there is an escaped lunatic at large!!! She has also whispered in the ear of Jimmy as well. When Herbert turns up strangled - who is the killer???? The murderous and gleeful gleam in Tashman's face when her scheme comes together is wonderful to see.There is a romantic subplot involving Regis Toomey as a young policeman and Sally O'Neal as the maid but it is never allowed to get in the way of the main story. Being a pre-code horror things don't go always to plan - you may be surprised at the end result. The ending was very similar to \"The Maltese Falcon\", which preceded it into cinemas by a few months.Highly Recommended.", "(POSSIBLE SPOILER) If Paramount had produced this film a year or two before 1931, the studio might have made it a straightforward mystery with little emphasis on terror. But in 1931, horror films were in vogue due to the success of Universal's DRACULA. So Paramount pursued this trend with MURDER BY THE CLOCK.  It's still a mystery but with the atmosphere of a horror film.And what horror!  There's a crypt with an installed horn that blares to warn people the occupant has been buried alive.  There's a drug that revives the dead.  There's a brute (Irving Pichel) with the strength and the mind of a beast.  And there's a sinister woman (Lilyan Tashman) who seduces men to commit murders for her own gain.It is Tashman, as the nefarious Laura Endicott, who dominates the film. Adorned in tight satin dresses that showcase her lithe figure, she vamps with sinuous style, as bewitching to the audience as she is to her pawns. She definitely had the potential for stardom but would sadly pass away a few years later.The other performers are generally fine. Irving Pichel is memorably creepy as the bestial Phillip Endicott.  William \"Stage\" Boyd (not to be confused with William Boyd who played Hopalong Cassidy) makes a dependable hero as the hard boiled, commonsensical detective Lieutenant Valcour.The scenario is too convoluted to be summarized here, but director William Sloman efficiently if unremarkably moves the film along.  The film also benefits from handsome sets, particularly a spooky graveyard setting.MURDER BY THE CLOCK has a few flaws shared with many early sound films. The film tends to be talky, causing it to drag occasionally (though never when Tashman is speaking).  And while background music is unnecessary whenever the aforementioned horn resounds, it could have enhanced the other horror scenes. But on the whole the film is very satisfactory and, thanks to Tashman's performance, unforgettable.", "Curiously enough, none of the previous reviewers have picked up on this film's title, which has negligible bearing upon anything that actually happens; of which there is plenty. What 'Murder by the Clock' sorely lacks is decent direction, editing and a music score; what it has is a jaunty plot, a magnificent (though underused) churchyard and crypt set, atmospheric photography by Karl Struss, an entertaining cast of wierdos and weaklings. And the breathtaking Lilyan Tashman.Blanche Friderici is Julia Endicott, matriarch of the Endicott clan, plainly nearing the end of its thinning bloodline; her only heirs being Philip (Irving Pichel), a hulking simpleton capable of breaking a man's neck with his bare hands but little else, and Herbert (Walter McGrail) a drunken weakling completely under the thumb of his gold digging wife Laura, who Julia sums up as \"a malicious designing creature, ought to be hung for a witch.\" The late Lilyan Tashman is an absolute blast as this platinum blonde Lady Macbeth smirking evilly one minute, shedding crocodile tears the next while flirting like mad with every man in sight with a pulse (\"I could be awfully fond of you\"), her curvaceous, Amazonian chassis seductively on display in a clinging satin number that would probably have caused censorship problems a few years later.The unfunny comic relief provided by Irish cop Regis Toomey and maid Sally O'Neil is rendered wholly superfluous by Tashman's rollicking performance, which gets plenty of appreciative laughs. She meets her match, however, in Lt. Valcour (William 'Stage' Boyd), who engages her in a final battle of wills, \"one artist to another\".", "Murder by the Clock from 1931 is so old it creaks. There are precodes and precodes - I find that films done before, say, 1933, are not well paced, the performances are mannered, and everyone talks slowly and takes big pauses in between. And there's an echo.That out of the way, the cast members proved later on that they were capable of so much more: Lilyan Tashman, William Boyd, Irving Pichel, and Regis Toomey.The story concerns the will of an old woman (Blanche Friderici) as she decides who is getting her money. That is, if she ever dies - she's so terrified of being buried alive that she has a horn installed in her crypt.She has two choices as far as to whom she will leave her wealth - her son, the village idiot, or her worthless nephew (Pichel). Pichel's wife (Tashman) is constantly nagging him about getting the old lady's money sooner rather than later.A domino effect is set up where people start dying - and two miraculously seem to come back to life, though one only briefly.It's obvious who the mechanic behind the murders is, especially to the lieutenant on the case (Boyd). Will he do the right thing? And can he get the proof?This is an old dark house mystery with secret passageways, a graveyard, a crypt, and it's dark. Frankly, I found it a little plodding. I thought William Boyd came off the best - he seemed to have found a good rhythm for his dialogue, and his acting was strong. Tashman for me got better as she went along.I'd say this was a fun film, but you have to be in the mood. The echoes, the slow dialogue, the long pauses, plus the fact that it's hard to see much with the lighting, don't make this a favorite.", "\"Murder by the Clock\" is an early murder mystery and it has a lot going for it. Unfortunately, it seems to have just about as much going against it and I see it as a movie only worth seeing if you have nothing better to do!When the story begins, you learn that a nasty old lady is trying to figure out which person to leave her fortune to--and one is an obviously psychotic and mentally challenged guy. But leaving the money to a different relative is NOT a good choice either, as the man and his conniving wife, Laura, plan on murdering the old lady. Once this occurs, it's like a bag of potato chips...and Laura manipulates the men around her to keep killing to ensure she'll be rich AND avoid jail.The problems with the film mostly boil down to subtlety....or the lack of it. Laura (Lilyan Tashman) is so obviously manipulative and evil that she's practically a cartoon character (like Snidely Whiplash, perhaps). And, because she's so obvious and transparent, seeing men throwing their lives away for this not super attractive and nasty lady just didn't make any sense. The other problem was that the film went on too long...and relied too much on filler. Cutting a bit of it AND making Laura more believably evil would have improved this one significantly.", "1931's \"Murder by the Clock\" has remained a forgotten horror from the early 30s, but not by such eminent film historians like William K. Everson, who dutifully included it in his 1974 book CLASSICS OF THE HORROR FILM. Had it been made at Universal, no doubt it would be as well remembered as \"Dracula\" (which preceded it) or \"Frankenstein\" (which followed it), but Paramount did their share of terror classics too (\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\" \"Island of Lost Souls,\" \"Murders in the Zoo\"). The sultry and seductive Lilyan Tashman (Mrs. Edmund Lowe) epitomizes what the word 'vampire' meant to audiences prior to Lugosi, a huge star going back nearly ten years, whose life would sadly end from cancer just three years after she made this. Irving Pichel, as the halfwit son with the strength of a bull, preferred working behind the camera rather than in front of it; nevertheless, as an actor, only his memorable work opposite Gloria Holden in \"Dracula's Daughter\" can compare with his macabre characterization here. Comic relief is supplied by Sally O'Neil's maid and Regis Toomey's Oirish cop (she co-starred with young Lon Chaney in 1933's \"Sixteen Fathoms Deep,\" while Toomey's next film would see him co-starring with Boris Karloff in Universal's \"Graft\"). No, Paramount rarely dabbled in horror during the 30s, yet there wasn't a single dud among them.", "There's definitely plenty of chills to be found in this often told story of murder and mayhem in a spooky mansion where an imperious matriarch (Blanche Friderici) manipulates her family as they scheme against her estate. She's afraid of being entombed alive, so she arranges a way of escape, and when her family begins to arrive, it's only a matter of time before the grim reaper comes a-callin'. The whiskey voiced Lilyan Tashman is a daughter-in-law leading several of the men on, and more bodies begin to pile up.Dozens of programmers of the 1930's and 40's repeated this plot (which goes back to the early silent era and to many barn-storming melodramatic plays), and this one is one of the most thrilling to watch with its silent film type photography, grand guignol style acting, and some wonderful twists and turns. Technically brilliant, it utilizes some shocking close-ups and brilliant shadowing, and includes an ending you probably won't see coming. Irving Pichel, a forgotten master of the creepy performance, gives another memorable one that ranks up there with his roles in \"The Cheat\" (1931) and \"Dracula's Daughter\" (1936).", "To judge by \"Murder by the Clock\" (1931), never was a director more aptly named than Edward Sloman. Slow man? Under Sloman's snail-speed direction, time and clock seem to be not just standing still, but actually running backwards.Of course, the stagey, dialogue-riddled, but proudly \"B\"-grade and super-suspenseless script doesn't help.Nor do the cheesy production values, plus the self-consciously hammy acting from all concerned, with but two exceptions, namely Martha Mattox and rather unexpectedly, William \"Stage\" Boyd.\"Who's the very worst offender among the players?\" you ask.Irving Pichel, I'm sorry to say!Although Lilyan Tashman runs Pichlel mighty close, she does model some really attractive clothes.", "Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde...and Murder By The Clock??? There's a reason this semi-horror thriller hasn't joined the ranks of those famous movies from 1931, and it's that this film is nowhere near the same level. It has some good things, but can't decide if it's a mystery (a shadowy figure commits a murder, and about five minutes later lets the audience know he did it!) horror (some mild Edgar Allan Poe Premature Burial stuff) or Vamp movie - the female kind, not the undead!The plot basically concerns Laura Endicott's (Lilyan Tashman) manipulation of the pathetic males she's lumbered with into each committing a murder in order to get her hands on the family fortune. It's fun to see Irving Pichel - after all he directed An American Tragedy and The Most Dangerous Game! - as the retarded brother constantly going on about killing people with knives and strangling them! And the film raises a few atmospheric moments. One or two of the cast moved on to Paramount's other horror show that year - Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Murder By The Clock failed to set the box office bell ringing, probably because it lacks the new supernatural element of the previously mentioned horror flicks. The direction is nothing special and the pace is slightly leaden. But it ain't bad as these things go, and is worth a look.", "This was another movie that I had never heard of until it popped up on a list of horror movies from 1931. I decided that for my Odyssey Through the Ones, I would give this a viewing. I did read the synopsis here, but aside from that, I came in pretty blind with this one. The synopsis is an elderly woman installs a horn in her crypt in case she's buried alive.Now that is part of the premise to the movie, but that really isn't a major part to be honest. We start in a cemetery where the caretaker is informing a family that they're closing up and have to go. They inquire why Julia Endicott (Blanche Friderici), her son Philip (Irving Pichel) and her sister of Miss Roberts (Martha Mattox) are allowed to enter. They have special permission due to Julia's late husband owning the land before it was sold.The reason for their visit is to pay respects to Julia's late husband and Philip's father. Miss Roberts points out the real reason is to check to make sure the horn connected to her tomb is working like the synopsis states. She has a fear of being buried alive. I should also point out here, Julia is hard on her son and he is a bit mentally slow as well. Miss Roberts is quite protective over him though.They return home and where we also get to meet their new maid, Jane (Sally O'Neil), as well as beat cop that walks around the neighborhood of Officer Cassidy (Regis Toomey). These two provide some levity to things. Jane also informs Julia that her nephew of Herbert (Walter McGrail) is coming over. Julia isn't thrilled to hear about this, especially if his wife is coming with him. She knows that Laura (Lilyan Tashman) is only with him for her money.Before he arrives, we see an odd scene with Philip. He wants to kill. When Julia inquires more, Philip doesn't want to be a soldier, but a murderer. She realizes she cannot leave the fortune to him. She calls for her attorney to make a change to the will, making Philip the sole beneficiary.We also get to know his wife a bit more. She is having an affair with Thomas Hollander (Lester Vail). He's a local sculptor who has also been giving her money as Herbert doesn't make enough for the lifestyle she wants to live. Herbert informs his wife of the change to the will and she subtle convinces him to kill his aunt. She won't admit to it, but men fall victim to her looks.With the deed done, Philip becomes the prime suspect. He has one of the best motives for killing her, but Lt. Valcour (William 'Stage' Boyd) believes that Herbert has a better one. This causes him to be paranoid. Laura seems to be in control and is planning steps down the line. Lt. Valcour though doesn't trust her and is out to prove it.That is where I'm going to leave my recap and where I want to start would be that this movie has an interesting premise, especially for 1931. This is still pretty early in the murder mysteries, but what I like here is that we're getting a slightly different take on it. This also seems to be leaning into the film noir category since Laura is a femme fatale and really the mastermind of everything here. There is even a bit of flirting between our detective of Lt. Valcour and her as well.This is something I want to delve a bit more into as well. Laura really uses her sexuality as a weapon to convince Herbert, Tom and even to an extent Philip. The latter I feel bad as he is mentally slow and really buys into what people say about him. She uses all of these men at different times to get what she wants and try to get away with it as well. Lt. Valcour should fall into this a bit as she does try to work her charm on him, but no matter what she does, he is sticking to his guns.Philip is also an interesting character in all of this. We see that in the beginning, he's scared to go to the cemetery. Julia is mean to him about this while really the only one who truly cares about him is Miss Roberts. Philip is a psychopath though. He isn't all there mentally and he probably needs to be in a hospital to better help him. I believe this upbringing doesn't help in this case either. Julia is hard on him and it has negative effects. There is something interesting from a demonstration that he did that I didn't initially pick up on that plays back into the explanation in the end that I found interesting.Then really the last thing I want to point out is from the synopsis. This horn in the tomb is interesting. I've heard of this idea with a bell back when science wasn't great. The movie really points out how important the horn is, but to be honest, it really isn't as impactful to the story as I thought. I guess it really is a bit of swerve in this respects, but I was thinking back to it constantly and it doesn't seem as important as they make it out to be.Moving away from the story, I'll take this to the acting. No one really blew me away, but I think the acting is solid enough to make this story work. Boyd is good as this detective. I like this is a bit early to film noir, so he's not blinded by the femme fatale. He wants the truth and I like how determined he is. Tashman is attractive enough to fit her role. I also like her portrayal. When you hear her, you'd think that she is innocent, but we see how evil minded she is. Pichel is good as playing this character that is slow, but strong. He fit there. McGrail is fine along with Vail as men who get sucked into her lies. I thought Friderici plays this mean older woman to a tee. Toomey and O'Neil bring a bit of comedy while Mattox as well as the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.Then really the last thing to point out here is that we don't get a lot in the way of effects. It is early cinema and also not really that type of movie so it doesn't need them. The cinematography is much of the same. It doesn't stand out, but shot well. The copy I was watching wasn't great so there is that as well. Then finally the soundtrack was fine, but I did want to comment on the design. The horn that is used was effective. It doesn't really amount to much in my opinion. It is effective when you hear it and know exactly what it is.In conclusion here, I think this is an interesting early murder mystery. I'm surprised to see this is listed as horror, but I think the possibility of being buried alive and what the movie makes us believe that Philip is capable of makes sense. There is a greed and murder as well. I think that the concept of this movie is really interesting, especially for 1931. The acting helps bring these characters to life. The sound design of the horn is effective and I'd say the cinematography, effects and soundtrack fit for what was needed. I would say this is an above average movie and one that I think should be seen more.", "In this wonderfully atmospheric, creepy, classic 'dark old house mystery', complete with everything from secret passages to Edgar Allan Poe's fear of being buried alive, we definitely learn that, although in real life they've probably been around ever since Eve, the femmes fatales were also present in movies long before the term became popular as a characterization for fatally beautiful and sensuous women who lead men astray - usually in order to get into a large fortune...And that's exactly what Lilyan Tashman alias Laura Endicott does here: blonde and provocative, she turns one man's head after the other, turning them all against each other to kill one another, to inherit the large estate of her husband's aunt. She stops at nothing, and she thinks no one can stop her, and no one can resist her - but HERE she finally makes her big mistake: there IS someone who (even though with some difficulty, as the way he looks at her just before he takes her to the police station clearly shows...) CAN resist her; unbending, incorruptible Lieutenant Valcour (William Boyd)...A wonderfully enjoyable, suspenseful, entertaining mixture of daring pre-Code sensuality and good old-fashioned murder mystery, one of the best of its kind, with a great cast, stylish settings - and quite a clear 'message': Beware of dangerous blonds...!", "\"Murder by the Clock,\" either intentionally or unintentionally, had a wonderful villain. Laura Endicott (Lilyan Tashman) was delightfully wicked. Laura, like many people, was looking out for numero uno, but unlike most people, she was going to do whatever it took to get what she wanted. And what she wanted was money.She was married to Herbert Endicott (Walter McGrail) and having an affair with Thomas Hollander (Lester Vail). Thomas had money while Herbert was fairly broke, but Herbert stood to inherit a fortune from his aunt Julia Endicott (Blanche Friderici) as soon as she died. Waiting for her to die was going to take too long so Laura, ever so manipulatively, put the idea of killing Julia in Herbert's head.The entire movie Laura was expertly pulling the strings on various men. The only man she couldn't manipulate was Lt. Valcour (William 'Stage' Boyd). He had a sneaky suspicion that she was behind the various murders and he couldn't be swayed by her feminine wiles.Like I said at the beginning, I loved Laura. She was playing chess while everyone else was playing checkers. Sometimes a movie has a villain that you like and respect, and Laura Endicott was that villain.", "That's how detective William 'Stage' Boyd calls it with his analysis of scheming Lilyan Tashman (Laura). Her husband Walter McGrail (Herbert) is a candidate to inherit a fortune from old, grumpy Blanche Friderici (Julia). No wonder she's a sour-puss. Have you seen her son Irving Pichel (Philip)!!?? Well, Tashman is having an affair with Lester Vail (Thomas) and she will stop at nothing to get that inheritance all for herself.We have a body count in this film so keep watching as they tally up. Tashman steals the show and Friderici is also good. Both these women deliver entertaining no-nonsense dialogue. The film is presented in the style of a creepy, house mystery with some nice sets for extra spook factor, eg, the crypt where there has been a siren installed in one of the tombs to alert people to any movement within a casket. This is quite a good idea. Basically, Friderici doesn't want to be buried alive so has an alarm system installed to prevent this happening to her. She recounts a story of someone who had turned over when their casket was opened. Ha ha. Actually, it's not that funny. I think I might have one.However, whilst the sound of this horn is occasionally used to good effect, there is one particular scene where they could have just turned it off as it becomes irritating. Also, the lack of a soundtrack sometimes gives the film a feeling that it is dragging. Some tense music may have added to the atmosphere instead of leaving the action stale in patches.It's nothing brilliant but one of the better efforts for this type of film.", "This is an excellent movie from the pre Production Code era that very well combines the detective gender with the horror one.Combining the graveyard setting with the old dark house, it has an atmosphere as creepy as any straight horror movie. The performances of all of the players are uniformly good.Lilyian Tashman is wonderful as the totally amoral con-woman, who manages to manipulate each one of the men she pretends to love into doing her killings for her while protesting that she didn't really MEAN for them to do that! William(stage) Boyd is superb as the tough, incorruptible police lieutenant who refuses to stop trying to learn the truth despite pressure and temptation by Tashman.Very much like Bogart's Sam Spade.Boyd reminds you in voice and somewhat in appearance of Randolph Scott.It is a pity that his problems with drugs and alcohol ruined his career and let to an early death.He was a great actor and might otherwise have rivaled Bogert and the rest as a tough, no nonsense leading man", "MURDER BY THE CLOCK has been resurrected in the last few years, turning up on dvd and getting a second look. It's sooo good. When you come down to it, there is something so appealing to these cobwebbed oldies peppered with an assortment of just plain strange characters. This one takes the grand prize. Paramount, at the time when DRACULA made its debut, began its own series of horror films and all had their diabolical moments. MURDER BY THE CLOCK pulled out all the stops, all about a conniving female, memorably played by Lilyan Tashman, who marries in to money for the sake of getting all the money-- for herself. But now for the good part. She has to contend with her suspicious and complaining aunt (Blanche Frederici, in a good role) who has a towering half-witted son (Irving Pichel at his menacing best), who has his eyes on her. The lights go out, the old lady gets knocked off, her son goes on the prowl; lots of sliding doors, eere faces in windows, cobwebs, shadows and a strange horn that blares out in the middle of the night from a tomb to warn us that somebody has been buried alive!! Try all this on for size. The kind of movie written by an over-active imagination, the kind they don't make any more. What a late night treat! RECOMMENDED.", "\"Murder by the Clock\" is a black-and-white mystery thriller with some eerie, horror-like aspects. It's a pretty good mystery thriller too, although nowadays the various performances may seem over-emphatic and theatrical to our modern (and cynical) eyes.The movie is notable mainly for a superbly blonde Lilyan Tashman, dripping with furs and jewels, who plays a highly intelligent femme fatale capable of eating ten other femmes fatales for breakfast. This lethal beauty is always plotting and seducing, plotting and seducing, plotting and seducing ; had the movie been any longer, it might have included her convincing the plumber to strangle the postman... Stakhanovism, that's what it is !Sadly enough the intervening decades have not been kind to the image quality, at least in the version I found. Many of the images looked blurred and indistinct, as if seen through the wrong pair of glasses. High time for a careful restoration...", "An ice blooded femme fatale uses her wiles to eliminate the men who stand between her and a fortune. More a psychological study than a mystery, it may be a bit creaky by today's standards, but still is surprisingly entertaining."], "tt0022265": ["It starts with a prison break with a man about to be electrocuted jumping over the wall onto a moving train and then being picked up by a plane dangling a rope ladder!  And that is just the first 5 minutes!  Most of this is an \"old dark house\" style thriller about a mad killer called The Phantom who is out to kill a local district attorney (former D.W. Griffith regular Wilfred Lucas).  The D.A.'s daughter (Allene Ray) and her reporter boyfriend (Guinn WIlliams) team up to catch the cloaked maniac and, in the tradition of movies like this, do a much better job than the cops who have surrounded the house. They trail the madman to an insane asylum where nobody, and I mean NOBODY! is playing with a full deck.  For a one hour film the plot gets complicated with things like insanity, kidnapping, revenge and even brain transplants.  The only thing missing was a gorilla, and if the plot had run another 10 minutes I'll one would have popped up!  It all makes sense (well, sort of) at the end when the prison warden shows up to identify the mad killer.  (You don't expect ME to reveal who it is, do you?) Also in the cast is The Clutching Hand himself, Sheldon Lewis.  In a cap, tall hat and fright wig he is still playing the character he created for the 1916 serial THE EXPLOITS OF ELAINE and doing it rather well.  Lweis was also the only actor to ever play Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde twice.  Once in 1920 in the version filmed on location in New York to compete against the John Barrymore and again in 1929 in a one reel talkie short. Art?  No way.  Fun?  You bet!  See this one.", "A prisoner named the Phantom is moments away from going to the chair when he climbs over the wall, jumps on top of a passing train and makes a get away when a plane flies down and picks him up. He then threatens the DA, even though he's not the DA who sent him up the river...and then things get complicated.This is a movie from the early days of sound. Using silent footage with sound effects it broadens what could be done at reasonable expense with the then bulky sound equipment. As a result this film does things that many similar movies from the period couldn't, it goes outside the drawing room, the best example is the jail break at the beginning.But while it goes places that other films didn't, and it has more twists than a pretzel factory, this film suffers from the same problem that countless other lower budget films did, and that is its limited by sound itself. There is no music and many scenes are staged simply to have people talk, a sequence at the beginning in the newspaper editor's office for example, goes on way too long just so we can hear the characters talking on the phone.The movie itself is interesting up to a point, but at times it seems to want to get as many of the mystery conventions into the movie as possible so things keep spinning out for no real reason other than to make the film reach a reasonable length. The problem is that as interesting as the plot is, the film's age hinders full enjoyment of it.If you're in the mood for an antique give it a try, otherwise steer clear.", "This is the kind of movie you start watching from the cynical forward-looking viewpoint of 2007 and start complaining that the premise is hokey, the set-ups are creaky and the dialog is loaded with clich\u00e9s.Then you realize that this film IS SO DANG OLD that it represents probably the first time that some of these set-ups, situations and dialog were ever seen on the movie screen! This dates from only the third year that talking pictures were widely available, so there wasn't much before this that this film could be ripping off, except probably stage plays. From this perspective, there is at least some originality here by definition, and lots of fun to be had with the murderer-on-the-loose-in-the-creepy-insane-asylum premise.This would make a great double feature with \"The Old Dark House,\" from 1932, creating lots of fodder which would be mocked in the ensuing decades by Bugs Bunny cartoons, Three Stooges shorts, Abbott and Costello films, sketches on \"The Carol Burnett Show,\" \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" and Larry Blamire's \"Dark and Stormy Night.\"The four-feature DVD from Retromedia is worth the price if you are a fan of obscure, ancient, creaky horror movies like this. You can look up the other features under the individual titles for reviews, but they are all just about as entertaining as this feature. If black-and-white horror films from the dawn of time are not your bag, you should pass, otherwise this DVD is a worthwhile purchase. And these movies are so old that they won't really scare children except for the smallest tots. Pop some popcorn and go back to the 1930's.", "Here's a film from the early sound era. This one, I'm pretty sure, was from good old Poverty Row, purveyors of wads of borderline unwatchable dreck from the olden days. This one was a little bit better than most of these cheapo programme filler efforts, as it has just enough interest to get it over the line but don't get me wrong, this is ropey stuff in many respects. It tells the tale of a prison break, where a convict escapes (in an impressively dangerous looking bit of stunt work involving being lifted on a bit of rope attached to a plane, from a speeding train), soon after this a mysterious villain called The Phantom begins a terror campaign. To a large extent, this is one of those tried and tested old dark house movies, which were a staple of many a low budget pot-boiler in the 30's. To this end, we have a large cast of characters in a big house, with secret passages, a cloaked villain and a cowardly maid (and chaffuer) - i.e. Aside from having a man in a gorilla suit, this features typical nonsense which many of these films have. But there's enough oddball extras to keep this interesting enough, like the creepy bellhop, with the bizarre accent. Its really not bad, as these types of old school Poverty Row efforts go.", "I just read all of the other reviews to verify my premise, which turned out to be true. They all take the position that this movie is pretty awful on many levels. Well, sure it is since it is obviously a spoof and a send-up. Taking it seriously is a preposterous mistake of judgment. For whatever reason the director chose to go beyond all the limits and that is what gives him away. Maybe just to have fun, maybe to get even with the studio for some transgression, could have been anything. Like it or hate it as you choose but take a chill pill and recognize that your leg has been properly pulled!", "You know that this is NOT going to be a great film when you see that Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams is the star of the show. This isn't to say he's a 100% terrible actor, but in the lead he's clearly out of his league and doesn't have the acting ability or charisma to carry the film. Later, in supporting roles with actors such as Errol Flynn, he found his niche.The movie is about a character named 'the Phantom'\u2014who is wanted by the police. Additionally, the newspapers are trying to find out who he is as well as catch him. This eventually leads, believe it or not, to a missing doctor from a mental hospital who is actually alive and well\u0085and doing research on brain transplants!! It seems that the good doctor is crazy and he and the inmates are up to no good in this odd variation on an old dark house film.Sadly, the film is terribly written and the acting is even worse! There's a lady who screams and yells worse than Una O'Connor and another who swoons at the slightest provocation and makes groaning noises. It's all very amateurish and silly\u2014even by the standards of the day.By the way, towards the beginning of the film, you may notice that a few scenes of silent film footage were used. Because sound pictures run at a slightly faster speed than silent (24 frames per second instead of the varying 16-22 for silents), these few scenes look accelerated compared to the rest of the movie. This is sloppy, but considering the lack of care in this Poverty Row film, I wasn't at all surprised.", "\"The Phantom\" opens at a prison where the notorious title character is scheduled to be fried in the electric chair. When a newspaper reporter asks the warden if the killer has shown any fear about his impending execution, the warden replies that 'the Phantom' is \"totally unconcerned.\" A guard interrupts their conversation and informs the warden that a bi-plane is circling the penitentiary, and the warden asks if the plane has a numbers on its fuselage. The guard points out that there is no number on the plane. The next shot takes in the prison exercise yard as a prisoner scrambles over the top of the extremely high prison wall. How the prisoner managed to scale the high wall is never adequately explained, but he climbs atop the wall just as a passenger train barrels past the facility. He hurls himself off the wall onto the train while the guards armed with rifles blast away at him without any luck. Miraculously, he lands atop the train and clings to the edge while the bi-plane maneuvers itself into position. The pilot swoops down over the speeding train; the bi-plane comes equipped with a wire hook so that the convict can grab it and then the pilot wings the felon away to freedom. Although the stunt is wholly implausible, writer & director Alan James of \"The Phantom Thunderbolt\" stages this derring-do with considerable finesse, considering that \"The Phantom\" was made in 1931. This scene foreshadows a similar jailbreak scene from director Blake Edwards' Inspector Clouseau comedy \"The Return of the Pink Panther.\" Immediately, thereafter, Police Chief Murphy (Horace Murphy of \"Border Phantom\") issues a radio news bulletin alerting all citizens in an otherwise unspecified city that the Phantom is at large. The chief describes the villain pejoratively as \"a desperate criminal, a killer, a human tiger, take no chances and shoot to kill.\" The next scene occurs in the newspaper office of editor Sam Crandall (mustached Niles Welch of \"Empty Saddles\") as Detective Winters explains to Crandall that a tipster has informed them that the Phantom plans to go after the District Attorney John Hampton. Initially, Crandall doesn't believe it because Hampton didn't prosecute the Phantom. Nevertheless, Willis points out that the Phantom bears a grudge against the D.A.'s office, not so much the individual who sent him up, as \"responsible for his conviction.\" Specifically, Winters wants to see society reporter Ruth Hampton (Allene Ray of \"Gun Cargo\") about the threat to her father. Meanwhile, trench coat-clad Police Sergeant Pat Collins (Tom O'Brien of \"The Phantom of Santa Fe\") shows up at the courthouse and tells Hampton that the chief has assigned him to serve as the D.A.'s bodyguard until the authorities recapture the Phantom. As it turns out, Hampton has received a telegram already from the audacious Phantom with a message that the fiend wants to meet him at 12:30 PM at his house. Later, back at Crandall's office, we learn not only that the police are going to watch Ruth, but also that the editor is in love with Ruth. Ruth, however, has her heart and eyes set on another man, Dick Mallory (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams of \"Dodge City\"), a young reporter that she wants to wed. Dick wants to make good in order to impress Ruth's father, so Ruth and he can get married. Naturally, Crandall isn't happy with this revelation.Afterward, \"The Phantom\" transpires in two geographic settings; first, the principals scurry about Hampton's commodious country manor with Mallory and the Phantom creating considerable commotion and then second the mystery shifts over to a creepy sanitarium for the conclusion. The mansion and the sanitarium boast several secret passages and hiding places. Mallory sneaks into Mr. Hampton's mansion and disables the alarm system, while the cloaked Phantom--walking stooped over like a dastardly vaudeville bad guy himself--lurks on the premises. The Phantom frightens Lucy the maid and tries to abduct Ruth with his writhing fingers inches from her pretty throat when she brandishes a gun. No, the daffy dame doesn't drill him between the eyes. Instead, she threatens to kill him, and he flees mere moments before Dick arrives with gun in hand. Standing behind the door, the Phantom pistol whips Dick, but the big galoot recovers quickly and slings lead at him. Nonetheless, the Phantom eludes the police, but Mallory doesn't fare so well.Eventually, Mallory and Ruth rush off in the Hampton's limo to a sanitarium to nab the cloaked villain. Shorty, the chauffeur, and Lucy, two sources of comic relief, sought refuge in the same car earlier, and they find themselves accompanying our hero and heroine as they prowl the sanitarium. They encounter a tall, gawky, idiotic Swede who serves as another source of comic relief. Eventually, Dick meets Dr. Charles Weldon (William Gould of \"Waterfront\") who dreams about performing a brain operation and Ruth becomes his patient.At this point, \"The Phantom\" degenerates into a contrived but atmospheric entry in the haunted house comedies inspired by the lightweight horror classic \"The Old Dark House.\" Typically, when he appeared in B-movies, Williams took top billing, but when he played in big-budget epics, like the Warner Brothers westerns with Errol Flynn, he played either one of the sidekicks as in \"Santa Fe Trail\" or a villain as in \"The Comancheros\" (1962) with John Wayne. Williams here wears a suit and tie from start to finish. Director Alan James doesn't waste any time setting up the plot. The events depicted in the first two paragraph of this review transpire in less than ten minutes! The predictable but delightful comedy of errors concludes with a happy ending as the Phantom is unmasked. Jack Draper's black & white cinematography is uncharacteristic for its day because everything really looks dark. Interestingly enough, the entire plot takes place over the course of a single day. This is an enjoyable curiosity piece despite its age.", "For those who enjoy old films and are not put off by poor prints and bad quality sound, this hard to find film is quite fun.  Break out the popcorn on a Saturday night in front of the TV.  It is spooky and atmospheric, with a number of very funny, intentionally campy moments thrown in, much in line with The Old Dark House.  I loved the bit where the reluctant visitor to the spooky old house was being chased around by one of the deranged looking inhabitants with a large stick.  When he was finally cornered and was going to give himself up to whatever fate that awaited him, the ungainly old servant just lightly bopped the guy on the head and asked \"Hey, did you lose this?\"  I was quite struck by the connection this film made with me, even though it was made almost 70 years ago.", "Allene Ray was Pathe's premier serial queen of the 1920s but with the advent of sound her voice recorded in a high pitched tone so \"The Phantom\" was her last film. Her leading man was Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams in a regular role as a reporter. This was before he became known for his roles as the hot headed sidekick of Errol Flynn.\"The Phantom\" was due to go to the electric chair but he escapes in a daring scene that has him scaling the prison wall, jumping onto a moving train then climbing a ladder suspended from a plane. He vows to get revenge on DA Hampton, who, he believes, sent him to jail.\"The Phantom\" plans to meet Hampton at his house at half past mid- night to make him a proposition (we never find out what that is)!!! Dick Mallory (Guinn Williams) also comes to the house to ask if he can marry Ruth (as you would at 12.30 at night)!!!! He is mistaken for \"The Phantom\".Once the scene changes to Dr. Waldron's sanatorium - the sets become very striking, reminiscent of German Expressionist cinema. The maid and the chauffeur find themselves trapped in a Caligari like corridor. There are quite a few odd characters. A \"phantom\" dressed in a black cape eerily reminiscent of \"The Cat and the Canary\", a weird Karl Dane type with an umbrella. It is pretty scary. Allene Ray shows why she was a serial queen for many years - she is very good at looking fearful and frightened.Niles Welch was the red herring. He looked very strange and suspicious, but ...I'd better not say.I wouldn't say it's a great film but it is worth a look.", "After a thrilling opening, Alan James' movie hunkers down into an \"Old Dark House\" formula. And, it's an embarrassingly poor version of many earlier trips down the same path. Just last year (1930), filmgoers had \"The Bat Whispers\" follow \"The Bat\" and \"The Cat Creeps\" follow \"The Cat and the Canary\". These movies must have been very popular at the box office, as they continued to make moreThis is a good film to examine for a variety of mostly incongruous acting styles. Allene Ray (as Ruth Hampton) is performing as if she's in a serial (her natural habitat). Tom O'Brien (as Pat Collins) has pure silent film mannerisms (he was one of the John Gilbert's \"Big Parade\" war buddies). Wilfred Lucas (as John Hampton) looks like an actor waiting for the director (no D.W. Griffith). And, so on*** The Phantom (11/1/31) Alan James ~ Guinn Williams, Allene Ray, Niles Welch", "This old fashion mystery is quite quirky...plus a bit silly. This is more mystery than horror and you only invest 61 minutes of your time. That is if you sit all the way through. A murderer escapes death row and the electric chair and vows revenge on District Attorney Hampton(Wilfred Lucas), who put him away. Hampton's daughter Ruth(Allene Ray)is missing and a mysterious black masked, black caped figure with long scary fingers is easy to blame. Newspaper reporter Dick Mallory(Guinn Williams)seeks a promotion by capturing the masked killer called \"The Phantom\", who has the community on edge and in fear. The investigation leads to an asylum where a mad doctor(William Gould)is planning dastardly deeds like putting the brain of an ape inside Miss Hampton's skull. A maid(Violet Knights)and chauffeur(Bobby Dunn), I found down right annoying. Others in the cast: Niles Welch, Tom O'Brien, Sheldon Lewis and William Jackie.", "This is another movie that I had never heard until I was working my way through the horror movie releases from 1931 from Letterboxd. This one intrigued me with the title as it reminded me of the hero serial/film that came out. I did read the synopsis to this one before seeing it as I was trying to find something to pair up. It doesn't make the greatest double feature for my Odyssey through the Ones, but it will work. The synopsis I'm referring to is a group of people are stalked by a masked killer in an old mansion.We start this movie off in a prison. It appears that a criminal going by the nickname of The Phantom (Sheldon Lewis) is to be executed that day. The warden is talking to a reporter about this and they're alerted a plane is flying low over the building again. We then see The Phantom scales the wall, jumps to a train and the plane picks him up to make his escape.The Phantom then sends a warning to the district attorney, John Hampton (Wilfred Lucas). He wants to meet him at his house that night to kill him. John agrees and the police are going to send men over. A police sergeant of Pat Collins (Tom O'Brien) is the one assigned here.John's daughter is also alerted to this. She is a reporter for a local newspaper for the event section. Her name is Ruth (Allen Ray) and she is dating another reporter of Dick Mallory (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams). Her boss though is in love with her, Sam Crandall (Niles Welch). He expresses how he feels and she tells him she is going to marry Dick. They are just hoping he gets a promotion, which falls on Sam. He has to decide what he will do here.All of these people converge on John Hampton's home that night. Also included are his maid, Lucy (Violet Knights), who is jumpy and she is seeing the chauffeur, Shorty (Bobby Dunn), who is much in the same vein as her. The Phantom sneaks into the house along with another guy who makes a demand of John without introducing himself. This becomes a wild night to figure out who The Phantom really is and capture him before he kills anyone. Their search will lead him to a local asylum ran by Dr. Weldon (William Gould) and us getting to meet the odd Oscar (William Jackie).I feel that is enough to flesh out the story this movie and get you up to speed with what type of movie we are going to get. What I will start with is that this is short. It runs just over an hour and doesn't waste any time getting into it, which is good. What I found interesting though was that I thought we were going to get an 'Old Dark House' type film and that is how it starts. We actually get 2 of them including the asylum where we have secret passages and what not which I do enjoy.With this story here, I do think it is lacking some fleshing out of things. I like the idea of The Phantom, him escaping from prison and wanting to get revenge on the district attorney. It is interesting though is that John wasn't the DA when this case was tried, but The Phantom still blames the office. There is an interesting scene with Dick that we get early on into the night where I thought we were going to have to guess who The Phantom really is. Lewis plays the role quite creepy what I like, but the reveal is just a bit abrupt and not really shocking. It also feels a bit like a cheat as well. The movie really wants more to focus on this love triangle between Dick, Ruth and Sam, but Sam really just has to make one decision whether or not to give Dick the promotion or not. It seems they're on the right path to make a deep story, but didn't go far enough with it.What I will say is that the acting is fine. I can see why Williams has the nickname of Big Boy as he's a tall guy. It does make it hard for us to believe that he's The Phantom though. Ray is solid as his love interest, but they don't flesh out Ruth all that much. Welch is good as the better option for Ruth despite how she feels about Dick. Sam is a solid guy for sure. Aside from that I think the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed. Lewis as I said was creepy as The Phantom, Knights and Dunn bring some levity to the movie which we got a lot of in this era. I really liked Jackie as Oscar as well in his limited role.Then really aside from that, it just leaves me the cinematography, effects and soundtrack. For the former, it is fine. Being in early cinema, we are getting static shots. What I will give credit to though is the setting. Both houses are interesting with their secret passages and what not. I'm a sucker for that. This isn't really the type of movie that has effects, but I think the look of The Phantom is creepy. Oscar seems to be abnormally tall as well as slender and how he moves his body was interesting. Then really the soundtrack fit for what was needed. It didn't stand out or hurt the movie for me.This there really isn't a whole lot to delve into this movie that is where I'm going to leave it. I do think that we have some interesting set ups here, but the movie just doesn't go far enough in fleshing them out. I like the idea of this villain escaping from prison and trying to get revenge. The acting is solid enough. The setting and look of The Phantom are also bright spots. Aside from that, the movie is okay just lacking quite a bit for me to really enjoy this one. For that reason I'd say this is an average movie. There are good and bad aspects on both sides for me so I'm coming in the middle here.", "When a dangerous killer escapes from the local gaol, police suspect he may come after the DA as retribution for his incarceration. Assigned to protect the DA (Lucas), bull-nose detective (O'Brien) settles in for a long night that ends up turning into a fracas when \"The Phantom\" enters the house via a secret labyrinth of ducts and concealed passages, threatening the DA's daughter (Ray) before disappearing into the night. Fortunately, novice reporter (Williams) has a hunch \"The Phantom\" might be heading for a local mental sanitarium leading to a terrifying encounter with the residents of the local loony-bin.There's some mild chuckles and feint thrills in his uneven comedy-thriller, but the acting seems quite stilted at times and the tension seems to be constantly nobbled by ill-timed humour. Williams is the strongest performer as the young, assertive reporter keen to solve the mystery to earn a pay increase that will fund his ensuing matrimonials with the DA's daughter.I found the jittery housekeeper (Knights) a tad over-bearing, her incessant shrills and dramatics becoming old very quickly, while combined with her vertically challenged boyfriend, the Chauffeur Shorty (Dunn) the pair added a touch of farce to the proceedings that I felt were unnecessary diversions (perhaps padding). Nevertheless, it's coherent and at barely one hour in duration, nothing if not efficient.", "Phantom, The (1931)* (out of 4)1931 gave us horror classics like Dracula, FRANKENSTEIN and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE so it's understandable why something like THE PHANTOM has long been forgotten. A man is on his way to death in the electric chair when he jumps over a wall onto a train, which then has a plane come down, pick him up and take him away. He threatens to kill the man who sent him away at the strike of midnight and soon, inside that man's house, the mysterious \"Phantom\" starts to strike. This entry into the \"old dark house\" genre is the perfect example of a bad sound film. I'm not sure what the budget of this thing was but it's clear they really couldn't afford to do too much as everything here is quite poor. The screenplay is just a rip of THE BAT and THE CAT AND THE CANARY type of film (both were remade in 1930) and the acting is at times rather atrocious. Allene Ray plays the female \"love interest\" here and it didn't shock me to read that this turned out to be her final picture. A star of serials in the silent era, her voice and acting certainly didn't go over too well in talkies and I must admit that she might give one of the worst performances I've seen here. Other members of the cast are equally bad and that includes Guinn \"Big Boy\" Williams. Silent fans might find interest in seeing D.W. Griffith regular Wilfred Lucas and Sheldon Lewis from that \"other\" version of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE released in 1920. I've seen a rather large share of films from this genre and this here is without question near the bottom of the barrel. Even if the performances had been better there wouldn't have been any way to get around the bland screenplay and the all around cheapness of the film.", "I would think that for the people of 1931, this would be quite a movie. The beginning (as many have already stated), was quite exciting - even by today's standards. Then the movie drags a bit.But my reason for writing this review is only to add that the eclectic cast is worth watching. You can see the obvious influence of the silent era in their expressions and actions/reactions.But to me, Lucy (played by Violet Knights) almost steals the show. She seems to me a very funny actress. I hope to get to see her in something else some time. However, I suspect this is probably her crowning achievement as an actress, as she made less than ten talking pictures, and was only credited in two of them. I know her acting is overboard, but her expressions and manners are worth the watching of this movie to me. Without her, I would probably give this movie only one or two stars.The strange Swede (William Jackie?) is also a great comic in this, his only credited role (according to IMDb).If you like unusual characters, I think this is definitely a movie worth a watch. Don't expect a great story - as others have mentioned, the plot is a bit over-used. But the cast to me is not a disappointment.", "Getting back home late at night,I started looking for a quick Horror flick to view before going to bed. Looking round online, I stumbled on an Old Dark House title,which led to me meeting The Phantom.View on the film:Spanning just 61 minutes, the screenplay by writer/director Alan James avoids the plodding mood other low-rent movies from the era have by keeping the mystery moving at a snappy pace, as occasional appearances from The Phantom pulls more guests to the old dark house. Pre-dating Scobby Doo with the silly unmasking of The Phantom,James also offers up some risqu\u00e9 Pre-Code asides in the exchanges of the house guests. Staying firmly stage-bound for this early talkie, James & cinematographer Jack Draper give the Old Dark House a nice creepy, creaking appearance, which stretches with the very melodramatic performances of the cast in search of The Phantom.", "This is not 'The Phantom' you want to see. This one is of historical interest only. You want the serial version of Lee Falk's 'The Phantom' (1943) with Tom Tyler, or the feature version 'The Phantom' (1996) with Billy Zane, or even the totally different Murnau 'The Phantom' (1922).Of the 77 movies made by independent Action Pictures, this one is probably the most famous. Some think it's passable in the manner of 'The Cat and the Canary' (1927) but it's full of early thirties tedium--characters being scared when anything moves or is heard, or when a man in a black cape suddenly appears. It is an historical curiosity because the star, Allene Ray, was a victim of the transition to sound movies. A popular and beautiful serial star who did her own stunts, she had a high voice that didn't carry over well into sound films. This film was it for her. This was the kind of true story satirized by Jean Hagan in 'Singing in the Rain' (1952). Although credited as the star here, Allene hardly appears in it, and often doesn't speak, pretending to be 'unconscious.' Another victim of sound was Georgia Hale, the female lead in Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush' (1925) who made her last film in 1931.The real star, 'Big Boy' Guinn Williams, seen in western serials and films as well as 49 TV episodes of 'Circus Boy' (1956-1957), does battle with 'The Phantom,' who, in fact is not even in a disguise.Other than Allene's funny voice, there's nothing to recommend here. Just make sure Netflix doesn't send this to you when you want action or excitement with Lee Falk's 'The Phantom.'I give it a 3.", "This movie is NOT a horror-thriller! It's more like a comedy-horror - seriously it is. I was expecting this film to be a fairly decent older horror-thriller but it's just BORING. People in the film giving \"comical scared looks\" on their faces, maid & chauffeur are a comedy-duo, nothing really happening at all in the film - just fake, comical scared looks and senseless gun shooting inside the manor house hitting nothing - horrible shooters.If you are looking for a comical styled classic thriller-horror then you might like this film. Otherwise I would pass this one by - much better horror-thriller films to watch from the same year (1931).I hate to give bad reviews but this movie is NOT what I was expecting it to be. It's hyped as a horror-thriller but it's a comedy-horror-thriller.2/10"], "tt0022454": ["Wow. Creating opera singers in Paris was at one point, apparently, all the rage in literature - we have Christine Daae coached by the Phantom of the Opera and here, we have Trilby becoming an opera star under the tutelage of the great Svengali. This 1931 film stars John Barrymore in the title role, Marian Marsh as Trilby, along with Bramwell Fletcher as Billee, Trilby's boyfriend, and Donald Crisp.The poor, unkempt, dirty Svengali becomes obsessed with the artist's model Trilby. He hypnotizes her and takes over her mind. Though her boyfriend (Bram Fletcher) and the artists believe her dead, five years later, Svengali, now prosperous and clean, appears in concert with his wife, the phenomenal Mme. Svengali, the great opera star. After performing \"The Mad Scene from Lucia,\" she leaves the theater, and her friends recognize her. Just one small problem - Svengali has a weak heart, and he is more and more losing control over her. And now that Billee has seen her, he keeps showing up.This is a classic film, thanks to the performance of Barrymore and the great sets, which, as many people have mentioned, were inspired by The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Barrymore brings great humor and a vulnerability to an overtly scary role, and Marsh is adorable. Seventeen years old here, she retired at the age of 30, except for some TV appearances, and died at the age of 93. Blond Bramwell Fletcher, who often appeared on stage throughout his career, is Trilby's love interest. Eleven years after this film was made, he married Barrymore's daughter Diana.Had this film been made a few years later, it might have been a touch better. The actors and studio were still getting used to the sound process, so the rhythm of the dialogue is a little off. Nonetheless, this is an excellent film, and I'll take any opportunity I can to see the great Barrymore.", "I've only watched the film once \u0096 by way of Roan's fine if not outstanding DVD - and this happened fairly recently. SVENGALI follows its source novel (\"Trilby\" by George Du Maurier) pretty closely, which is rare for horror film-adaptations of the 1930s. Apart from John Barrymore's appropriately mesmerizing leading performance (here revisiting the genre after a whole decade), I recall one particularly amazing tracking shot demonstrating Svengali's hypnotic powers over Trilby, and there are even brief flashes of nudity (remember this was a Pre-Code film, but also that our heroine is a model)! Barrymore followed SVENGALI with the thematically-similar THE MAD GENIUS (1931) but, unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to watch that one", "The remark of an earlier commentator below caught my eye when he stated that the change in perspective from comedy to serious drama in this film didn't work for him.  I've found this to be a most striking feature of the film as well, but I always thought it very effective in giving the film, and the characters, more scope than the average uniform, by-the-book comedy, thriller, horror film, drama, etc.  A bit like real life, no?Anyway, I've always been a fan of this film, and I don't think the acting is at all hokey for its era or genre.  The stylized acting of the time, which appears artificial by today's standards, seems to me to go well with the weird expressionist set design in evoking a fantastic world where fantastic things can occur.  Also, the chance to see Barrymore ham it up in grand style as Svengali is, in my view, a rare treat, like experiencing a bit of show biz history.  I bristled a bit at the review of this film by Scott Weinberg of the Apollo Movie Guide (see \"external reviews\" link).  He states that in 1931 you could entertain people by showing 75 minutes of an airport runway, and that his being born in the 70s may explain why this film put him to sleep.  Maybe so.  I myself was born in the 50s and also did not grow up with this style of filmmaking, though I probably saw more of it on TV than he did.  That doesn't preclude my appreciation of it, any more than it precludes my appreciation for films of the 70s, the 80s, or the 20s for that matter.  Good film is good film, and having no appreciation for the first 3 decades of cinema and some of its greatest innovators seems a severe handicap for anyone who writes about film, but at least he was honest about it.I'm not saying that this film is on a par with the work of Murnau or Eisenstein, but I do think it's a fascinating and stylish look into a bygone era of cinema, and can be appreciated as such.", "Such a story could only be committed to celluloid during the precode era. John Barrymore, as Svengali, makes us empathize with him as we are presented with a very complex villain.The opening twenty minutes or so of the film are pretty much light-hearted fare as Svengali is presented as a fortune-hunter when it comes to his women pupils and also a very creative panhandler when it comes to his British artist acquaintances also living in the artists' section of Paris. By chance, Svengali meets artists' model Trilby. Trilby is a bit of a dual-natured creature herself. She has the language and bearing of a free spirit, yet she also has angelic delicate features and sports a gendarme's coat that seems to say \"No Trespassing!\". Svengali is captivated, perhaps for the first time in his life, with another human being, not just with what that human being can do for him. The movie takes a sharp turn into darker territory when Svengali uses his hypnotic hold on young model Trilby to turn her into a singing sensation. He can make her do anything he wants through his hypnotic powers - even marry him. However, when he lets her out of her trance she feels nothing for him. There is a particularly touching scene in which Svengali talks to \"the real\" Trilby and she says that she has tried to love him but simply does not. Frustrated, he quickly puts her into a trance, and his marionette parrots back her love for him. Heartbroken, he realizes all that is happening when she speaks her affection is that he is talking to himself. As time passes it is interesting to see how Svengali ages, as the weight of holding back Trilby's true will seems to be slowly killing him. The ending is not sewed up neatly at all, and it is a bit shocking to see how it breaks off.The best parts of this film are John Barrymore's great performance as Svengali and also the art design. If you've ever seen The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari, the art design is quite similar to that, especially in the first part of the film in Paris. The windows and doors all have odd shapes and angles, as the visual style of the whole film takes on a nightmarish and surreal quality.", "An exceptional classic film. In a storyline very similar to Dracula, the strange Maestro Svengali (John Barrymore) falls in love with a young girl (Marian Marsh) and uses his powers of hypnotism and mind control to seduce her. Erie, eye catching, strangely romantic and a little twisted, Svengali was everything Dracula should have been. The film is a masterpiece of visuals. The slanted, disproportionate sets and imaginative camera work give many scenes a dreamlike feel. John Barrymore is perfect as the title character. He does not play Svengali as a flatly evil man, but gives him charm, humor and vulnerability. He causes us to pity him for his unrequited love almost more than we fear him for his actions. The talent of the supporting cast does not go to waste either. Marian Marsh gives a good performance as Trilby, the object of Svengali's desire, and Donald Crisp and Luis Alberni provide some comic relief as a couple of struggling artists. Complete with a dark, somewhat open ending, this movie has all the right touches. Svengali is better and more effective than a horror movie without quite being one itself.", "I saw this mysterious movie made in 1931 on TV once and was amazed.  I never saw it again so I decided to buy the DVD.  Great movie about a maestro who hypmotizes a 17 year old girl in a futile effort to win her love.  The make up is incredible and the sets are obviously inspired by the cabinet of Dr. Caligri (another great film).  John Barrymore looked creepy in the makeup and was great as Svengali.  The movie is a tad racey for the era in which it was filmed.  This movie delivers on all cylinders.", "John Barrymore tackles the delicious role of Svengali, the evil musician who casts a spell over pretty young Trilby, an artist's model (portrayed by Marian Marsh).  The chief reason to see Archie Mayo's production is the unique set design by Anton Grot (who, I am speculating, was rather inspired by The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari).  Also of note are the splendid special effects, still impressive even after all these years.  All of the hypnosis/possession sequences are remarkable, as great attention is paid to the piercing, penetrating eyes of Svengali as he mesmerizes the hapless ingenue.  The weak link here is the lukewarm Bramwell Fletcher, playing Trilby's true love.  He registers blandly, and behaves more as the passive mollycoddle than as the proactive hero.", "I just love this version of the classic tale \"Trilby\". John Barrymore is excellent as Svengali and pretty Marian Marsh is utterly charming as Trilby. The film has a very bohemian look and feel to it which is one of the reasons why you should enjoy it. The expressionistic sets were by Anton Grot and there is the famous striking miniature set of the rooftops of Paris that the camera tracks over in the classic scene where Svengali wills Trilby from her apartment to his one stormy midnight. Warner Brothers paired Barrymore and Marsh once again in \"The Mad Genius\" which is a rather adult, pre-code story with Barrymore just as menacing as he is in \"Svengali\", but not the demoniac that he is in this film. Note: The Roan Group (Roan Group.com) has the best DVD edition of \"Svengali\" available on the market.", "Svengali (1931)\"Svengali\" is a strange strange film, half nightmare, half plain old German Expressionism thrown into an inventive Warner Bros. set. It's amazing at its best, and the set design and photography both got Oscar nominations. The plot that gets built up of increasingly new elements, comic outsiders (Englishmen who believe in bathing every day) and a overtly beautiful blonde model and her apparent love match (they have just met), until the crux of it clarifies--the title character is a madman who can hypnotize people at will.John Barrymore in his archly long, dramatic is a creep, appropriately. When he hypnotizes, his eyes turn to these large glowing white orbs. He has fallen in love with a model and starts to control her, which her fianc\u00e9 only gradually realizes. Other people just find Svengali a quirky artistic type, and see no harm in him at first.The setting is odd--clearly shot on a studio lot rather than a real Parisian artists colony, it nonetheless is meant to be some kind of rambling set of rooms that are more or less attached, or near each other. For the whole first half, the main characters never really leave the irregular, sometimes offkilter chambers, which look like there were adapted from \"Caligari\" itself. The light and the framing, and the interesting very shallow depth of field, combine to make a mysterious and really beautiful effect.The Barrymores, as a group, are amazing, but their theatricality, especially John's, doesn't always transfer well to modern movies. In a way, it's this leading man who cuts into the disarming surrealism and horror overall, simply because he's so campy. This might be just a matter of changing tastes, because his effect reminds me rather a lot of Bela Lugosi in \"Dracula\" which was released the same year (a few months earlier). The story of Dracula is more archetypal and wonderful for the ages, but in my view (I've seen both movies recently) this is much better filmed. The photography, lighting, and blocking (the way the actors move) are more fluid and involved. Archie Mayo, the director, has a handful of completely wonderful films to his up and down career (click on his name to see). As much as this one has some obvious and forced sections, and a plot that doesn't quite involve the viewer as you would hope, it's a really well made, well constructed movie. For 1931 it's sometimes a pure wonder.", "There never was an historical figure named Svengali, nor a hypnotized Trilby on whom he worked his will. The novel was written in the late 1800s. The book was a big smash in those days, when people still read, so the name and the relationship became icons of vernacular culture.Barrymore is Svengali, a pianist and teacher of music, who lives in a decrepit boarding house in Paris with a couple of other half-starved artists. (The novel devoted a lot of time to a description of la vie Boheme on the Left Bank.) A young artist's model, Marian Marsh, falls in love with Billie (Fletcher) but falls under the hypnotic spell of the older Svengali. Well, it's more than hypnosis really. He can enter her head from across the city.Under his spell, Trilby becomes a famous soprano. Svengali fakes her death and whisks her off elsewhere. Svengali marries her. She becomes the toast of Europe with her soprano. The only thing that Svengali can't get past is her love for Billie. He has to hypnotize her to get her to cooperate in the boudoir and by the end, he's disgusted with himself for making love to a marionette. He longs for her love and gets it in the end, though it costs him dearly.There are a couple of good reasons for watching this old flick if the opportunity arises. For one thing, the direction, performances, and sets are pretty good for their time. In particular, a traveling shot across a miniature Paris is right out of German expressionism. And rooms are filled with dark, angular shadows.Then there's the way the story is shot. This was before the imposition of the infamous code, so there are scenes that wouldn't have made it past the censors a few years later. There's a semi-nude scene, for instance, which suggests that Trilby looks good all over.And then there's the dialog. Svengali has been described by his neighbors as \"a Polish scavenger.\" Indeed, he's unkempt and clomps slowly about. I think he once played Rasputin, the Mad Monk. If he didn't, he should have. But, what with his hypnotic eyeballs, he has this power over women. When a rich woman enters his studio for her music lesson at the beginning, he asks, \"What did we do last?\" The woman replies, \"Don't you remember?\" And he says, \"Ahh, yes, but I meant the music.\" The wealthy woman then tells him, \"I worship you, Svengali. I have left my husband for good.\" And Svengali squints thoughtfully and says, \"Yes, but how much did he leave YOU?\" When he discovers that she came to him without a penny, he throws her out and she commits suicide. \"Her body was found in the river!\" Svengali: \"Ah, that is impossible -- in this weather.\" Later, fighting Trilby's love for Billie, he dismisses Billie as \"that stiff-necked Englander, the head of the Purity Brigade.\" Barrymore plays all this with a comic relish, like Richard III. He revels in his exercise of evil.Marian Marsh, on the other hand, is one of the most beautiful young woman to appear in the screen in the early 30s. She doesn't have Garbo's knowing languour, although she's equally attractive, but rather the winsome eagerness of a child. She's like a porcelain doll with perfect features and a smile that has the same effect on a viewer as Svengali's glowing eyeballs.I wonder how many of today's kids would recognize the name of Svengali. (Never mind Trilby.) He may be disappearing along with much of the rest of our shared data base in vernacular culture. I once asked my college class if they had heard of Sinbad the Sailor. Forget it.", "Historic note of interest: In the early 19th Century, there was a scandal involving the British General-in-Chief of the Armies (then fighting Napoleon) where his mistress was found to have been selling commissions to wealthy, but undeserving men, for high private fees. The General-in-Chief resigned in 1809 as a result of this scandal. He was Frederick Augustus, Duke of York, second oldest (and favorite) son of King George III. The mistress, Mary Anne Clarke, faced some legal problems, but triumphed over most of them (she actually had public opinion on her side). Ms Clarke would marry and have a family. Her grandson was George Du Maurier (more of later); Her great-grandson was Gerald Du Maurier, the leading stage actor of the first half of the 20th Century; Her great-great-granddaughter was Daphne Du Maurier, novelist (REBECCA, JAMAICA INN, FRENCHMAN'S CREEK, MY COUSIN RACHEL, THE SCAPEGOAT), and great-great-grandma's sympathetic biographer (MARY ANNE). By the way, while Ms Clarke had quite a noteworthy progeny, the Duke of York never had any legitimate children, or illegitimate ones of note.But SVENGALI is not Daphne's book. It is the chief novel of her grandfather George. By the way, the title of the novel is not SVENGALI, but TRILBY. Trilby O'Farrell is the heroine of the story, and Svengali is the villain (\"Little Billee\" is the hero). But in Svengali George Du Maurier created one of the most memorable villain figures in the 1880 and 1890s, with Bram Stoker's Count Dracula and Conan Doyle's Professor James Moriarty, Anthony Hope's Rupert of Hentzau and Robert Louis Stevenson's Henry Jeckyll/Edward Hyde.Unfortunately there is an element in Svengali that is played down somewhat (but his appearance - based on the novel's illustrations by Du Maurier (who was a successful cartoonist) emphasize without subtlety). Svengali is Jewish - and a real villain in the story. He is first seen as a hanger-on, and one who sneers at the attempts by Little Billee, Taffy, and the Laird to be artists. That is because he has his own powers, but he is looking for the right person to use them on. He finds that person in Trilby, a beautiful young girl, quite innocent, who works as a model. One day he examines Trilby's throat somewhat bemusedly and discovers that it is perfectly formed for singing (hence the comment I put in the \"Summary Box\").Up to that time she is falling for Billee, but soon Svengali is giving her all kinds of singing lessons. Billee and his friends note this with apprehension (they barely can tolerate Svengali). Then she becomes increasingly distant and cold to them, especially Billee. Soon she leaves with Svengali. Billee suffers a collapse as a result.Billee recovers and in a few years learns that Trilby is the leading concert singer in Europe. But wherever she goes it is always with her impresario/husband Svengali. He \"keeps an eye\" on her and her activities. Billee can't stand this, especially after an accidental meeting with her leads to a feeling she doesn't even know who he is. He starts pursuing them, and finally drives to the fatal conclusion (which is quite different in the novel, but similar).I doubt if hypnotism really could do what Du Maurier suggested Svengali could do to Trilby. But this film certainly suggests it can. John Barrymore's Svengali was the closest role (in his sound films; he had played Dr. Jeckyll in a silent film) to a horror part, but he manages to make the impresario/hypnotist/musician a sad and compelling figure: the tragedy for Barrymore's Svengali is his success - he knows he controls Trilby (Marian Marsh), but that knowledge also brings doubt that she could ever love him or give herself to him on her own free will. It is a damning situation, and he does not know the answer until the last moment of the film. Svengali would be a hallmark role for Barrymore - he is a reference point in the role of Oscar Jaffe in the comedy TWENTIETH CENTURY, and a slightly watered down version is his unhappy impresario/husband to Jeanette MacDonald in MAYTIME.", "I felt very touched by J. Barrymore's performance as Maestro Svengali, although I had already tasted the pleasure to watch this great actor in Grand Hotel. The movie is short to me, while the way it develops is slow as slow the way Maestro Svengali speaks, to give a more sense of fatality to the movie. The little resources that movie makers could use during those old times are more than enough to give an impact still to the spectators of our century. The eyes, the decorations, all is very well portrayed and gives an eerie feeling all through the movie. The scene where maestro svengali looks at his beloved (before the end of the movie) when he speaks slowly while crying in silence is a masterpiece.I recommend this movie to people who want to discover more the classics, and those who like suspense and thriller movies.", "In the early 1930s, the horror genre entered into the era of sound films thanks to producer Carl Laemmle Jr. of Universal Studios, who after the success of \"The Cat Creeps\" in 1930, and specially \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" in 1931, inaugurated a Golden Age of American horror that produced a lot of classic movies. But while Universal was the major producer of horror movies and literally ruled the genre through the decade, it wasn't the only studio that was producing masterpieces in those years. Warner Bros. Pictures, a studio famous for their musicals, began their history within the genre only three months after Universal's \"Dracula\" was released, with a movie based on the popular novel by George Du Maurier, \"Trilby\", in which the legendary actor John Barrymore would enter for a second time in horror history by playing one of the most popular characters in Gothic literature: \"Svengali\".Set in France during the 1850s, the movie is the story of Svengali (John Barrymore), a music maestro who often uses his great skill at hypnotism to get what he wants from his pupils. One day he visits a group of artists he knows, hoping to get some money from them, but instead he meets Trilby O'Farrell (Marian Marsh), a beautiful model who has come from England to work with the artists. Svengali falls in love with her, but she prefers one of the artists, Billee (Bramwell Fletcher) instead. Despite this, Svengali doesn't lose hope, and one day when he uses his hypnotic powers to cure her headache, he discovers that while tone deaf, Trillby has actually good vocal chords. With this in mind, Svengali decides to use his power to its full extent and via hypnotism transforms Trillby in \"La Svengali\", a singer of unparalleled skill completely devoted to him. But Billee won't let him run away with his love.One of the last works by the experienced writer J. Grubb Alexander, this adaptation of \"Trilby\" remains close to Du Maurier's novel, but with an important change: the plot is focused completely on Svengali, and the story is shown from his perspective. This is even more interesting because unlike the rest of the villains of the era, Svengali isn't an archetype of pure evil, he is instead a really complex character that can be funny, evil and tragic as well, as he is essentially a human being with a great skill that he chooses to use in his favor. This complexity plays a big role in the film, as one of the central themes is Svengali questioning the morality of his acts and wondering if they are worthy. And despite this, writer Alexander manages to keep an equilibrium between the Gothic horror and the melodrama and the comedy of the script.Director Archie Mayo was one of the filmmakers who managed to make the jump from silent to \"talkies\" in the early 30s, and in \"Svengali\" one can see his experience in the silent era, as it is a very visual film. The most striking feature of the movie is its notoriously expressionist look, that goes beyond what Tod Browning had done in \"Dracula\" and truly feels like a German silent film at times due to its amazing use of sets and miniatures (including an awe inspiring shot over Paris' rooftops that's still impressive even now). Barney McGill's cinematography is put to great use through the film, and gives the movie a unique, almost surreal look that fits perfectly the themes of hypnotism that the movie handles. Mayo makes his movie to be highly atmospheric, and one can truly feel the tragic sense of impending doom that the characters have.The legendary John Barrymore returns to the horror genre more than 10 years after his excellent performance in 1920's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", and while lesser known than that famous role, his work as Svengali is simply masterful. As written above, the character is very well developed, and allow Barrymore to show his talent, and while he overacts at times, it strangely doesn't feel out of place in his role as Svengali is after all, an eccentric bohemian artist. Marian Marsh plays Trillby, and while very young at the time (only 17), she makes an excellent counterpart to Barrymore and is a highlight of the film, playing very convincingly the role of the energetic young model that becomes La Svengali under her master's spell. Bramwell Fletcher plays Billee, and while effective, his performance as the story's hero is nothing really amazing.Some have criticized \"Svengali\" for its use of comedy, mainly as Svengali is presented as clumsy at times, but in my opinion, that's a strength of the movie, as it offers an atypical villain in the sense that he is very human. Unlike more archetypal villains, it's easier to relate to Svengali, and feel identified with his story of unrequited love, and that's probably what's more disturbing about him: he just had the power to do his will and used it. It's hard to find a real flaw in \"Svengali\" (although I'm sure may dislike Barrymore's overacting at times), and probably its main problem is that while it has everything to be a classic, it simply gets easily overshadowed by the more influential (and superior in number) output of Universal Studios. However, I personally find it to be easily on the level of anything done by Universal.Seldom seen by the audiences nowadays, \"Svengali\" is one of those movies that even now can be impressive. In this movie, director Archie Mayo and John Barrymore give justice to Du Maurier's legendary character and bring him to life in extraordinary fashion. With its excellent performances and the beautiful art design, \"Svengali\" is definitely a forgotten masterpiece if there ever was one.9/10", "Svengali (John Barrymore) is an eccentric mystical music teacher/pianist who makes his daily bread giving singing lessons to aspiring students in Paris. His long hair, forked beard, and piercing eyes make the unusual instructor a prime target of ridicule among the local townsfolk. One day a stunning and earthy young model named Trilby (Marian Marsh, perfectly cast and the living picture of the girl you heard about in the song \"You're Sixteen\") makes her way into the life of Billee (Bramwell Fletcher from the 1932 MUMMY), and wins his devotion. But like all the red-blooded men in this tale, the sly Svengali takes a liking to her himself, and hypnotizes the girl into following him. It's always exciting to discover an old classic from Hollywood's Golden Age that still captivates. SVENGALI is only borderline horror at best, yet it remains a true gem, an absorbing achievement in every way: from the powerful lead performance of Barrymore, to the delicious beauty of 16 year-old Marian Marsh, to the bizarre set designs of Anton Grot, to the wonderful direction by Archie Mayo. This is when movies were movies. *** out of ****", "The great profile shows it off as the mesmerizing Svengali, who manages to enchant a young woman, realize her singing talents, and push her to excellence. Of course, there is the overriding theme of sexual manipulation. Trilby is beautiful (Great name, by the way. One of my neighbors had a canary with that name. Now I know where it came from). Naturally, this guy has to have an adversary, one who will spoil his plans by his very presence. That is Bobbee. The striking black and white cinematography with Barrymore at his absolute best is what makes this movie cook.", "Having read the original book, I watched this one and adored it. One of the things that first struck me was the incredible detail put into it. The set and costume design are matched perfectly with the original illustrations. Svengali, at the start, even plays Chopin's impromptu. Even though the story itself is a trifle different from the book, it is still mesmerizing to watch. In contrast to the book, Svengali is deprived of his malice, and left only with a frightful hypnotizing power. Other than Svengali himself, the other characters are exactly as in the book, and was wonderful. It was very moving, to have the first half hour or so be comical, and light-hearted, then the last half be absolute tragedy. It was such a great film.", "It's been many years since I read DuMaurier's \"Trilby.\" I was a young man then, probably much more impressionable than I am now. I didn't know that there had been a movie made based on the book - let alone several versions. When I came across the title on IMDb recently, I read the summaries and comments on all of them. It seemed to me that only one came close to the book - this 1931 Warner Brothers film, named after the villain of the story. Comparing the casts, one also could come to the conclusion that this would be the best of the films. So, I bought and watched the dvd of this film.John Barrymore does an excellent job as \"Svengali.\" Marian Marsh is very good as Trilby, and this is her first starring role after a few uncredited roles in films. The rest of the cast are fine in their roles. I did notice that the ending was different, if in the same vein.The film didn't seem to be as sinister as I recalled Svengali from the book. Perhaps the front of gentleness displayed by Barrymore here assuages somewhat the terror of his character's demonic side. I don't recall if his character had a gentle or sweet side in the book.The filmmakers did an excellent job in setting the story with the stark appearance of the lodgings and spacious empty hallways in the beginning. Once Trilby comes under Svengali's spell, it seems that the film moves very quickly to the end. I thought there was a little more to the intervening years in the book.This was a very good portrayal of one person controlling another, especially with dark powers. DuMaurier's villain's name soon transposed into common language. A manipulating person who seeks to control someone is referred to as a Svengali.", "The futuristic sets are combined with realistic sets in a very strange manner. You wonder, \"Am I taking a tour of various approaches to this movie: realism vs. fantasy, comedy vs. drama?\"Watching John Barrymore work is amazing. I have no frame of reference since I don't know how stylized the acting in 1931 was. I'm sure, since sound was new, that they were still working subconsciously under the same duress, the same constraints as having to show emotions only visually.Love the story as an analogue for the young woman who is mesmerized by some man she is totally incapable of having anything in common with. The last scene is puzzling, as we are once more back in fantasy land.Trilby herself is like a trilling bird, so cheerful and so under the spell of Svengali. Winding up in the cheap dance halls is their fate, as Svengali insists on having his way: another morality lesson. He didn't have the ability to be flexible.The price that ignorant Trilby pays for being hypnotized by this lying charming mesmerizer is death, who brings her great fame but at such a price!!!. Great analogue for our country in its present state..", "As the title character John Barrymore gives one of the better early sound performances in the film Svengali. The accomplished stage actor is a perfect fit for this larger than life character whose name has become synonymous with creative control. Barrymore brings not only a piercing menace to the role but also a touch of humor that humanizes and evokes sympathy at various moments in the story.The film opens as musician hypnotist Svengali coldly dispatches a follower under his spell to toss herself into the river. He is soon bewitched by the beauty of Trilby and through devious machination turns her into a singing sensation. Trilby however is not like the others he has discarded over time and while he pines for her love he will not resort to hypnotic date rape to get it.In addition to Barrymores absorbing messianic performance Svengali offers a fine supporting cast with Marian Marsh's innocent Trilby, Billie Bramwell as her milk toast lover and Donald Crisp, Lumsden Hare and Louie Alberni as acquaintances.The set design has a muted Caligari expressionism providing an ideal stage for the enigmatic maestro who at times borders on monster. There are some excellent pre code liberties taken that enable Svengali to maintain an amoral attitude throughout which allows for a powerhouse climax that makes this subterranean trip well worth the journey.", "John Barrymore is mesmerising as the title character, an impoverished music teacher and swindler who hypnotises the sweet but vulnerable young Trilby (Marian Marsh) into becoming his wife. Rather than just another one-dimensional villain, his Svengali harbours enough self-loathing and twisted love for his victim to make him a fascinating character. The shot in which his malign influence is indicated by a camera movement that swings around him before retreating across an expressionist town towards the sleeping Trilby is simply breathtaking.", "I love most of John Barrymore's films, so when this came on I jumped at the chance to see it. However, I was less than thrilled because this production of SVENGALI really showed its age. Instead of the subtle and engaging performances he was capable of doing, this was John Barrymore at his loudest and least convincing. In 1931, I am sure this style of excessive emoting was acceptable, but today it just looks old,...really, really old. A lot of reviewers on IMDb loved his acting--I am, so far, the lone dissent.The story itself is kind of fun to watch as long as you suspend your disbelief. Nearly everyone knows that the hypnotic trances and weird glowing eyes are only something you see in movies, but I can forget that for a while and just watch. And, on that level the film does work and it's an interesting curio of the age. Not a particularly GOOD film, but interesting nonetheless. And, it's pretty short so you aren't out much if you, too, think it's only at best average.", "In this amazing Warner Brothers production, it's hard to go past John Barrymore's delightfully full-blooded performance as the enigmatic Svengali, but Marian Marsh succeeds in doing just that with her compellingly unaffected, fascinatingly natural Trilby. Not only does she act the pants off the rest of the scene-chewing cast (led by the atrociously hammy Bramwell Fletcher), but she is more than a match for the glorious Barrymore himself. Even the great actor's copious bag of histrionic eye rollings, stompings and pregnant pauses, cannot compete with Marsh's entrancing charm and vivacity. Hers is a completely captivating Trilby. She has a lovely face too \u2013 superbly lit by ace cameraman Barney McGill \u2013 and her singing voice is exquisitely dubbed. Aside from Mr. Fletcher (who certainly looks the part, despite his atrocious verbal delivery), the other players are competent enough. Donald Crisp even affects a suitable Scottish accent. Of course, it's not all high melodrama. True to the 1894 novel, \"Trilby\" by George Louis De Maurier, there is plenty of intentional amusement, and most of this still comes across as successfully as the more dramatic scenes. In fact, the film's most famous episode \u2013 the celebrated hypnosis from a distance sequence \u2013 when the camera pulls back from Svengali and goes shooting across the rooftops to Trilby's apartment \u2013 seems almost as wonderful today as when it first drew gasps of astonishment from contemporary critics and picturegoers. Svengali certainly rates as director Archie Mayo's most inventive production.", "One of my favorite films of all time. I first saw this movie when I was 10 years old and it has been with me for the rest of my 50 years. John Barrymore's performance was incredible and still gives me chills to this day--his ability to make you hate and fear Svengali's diabolical scheming but to feel his heartache and yearning for Trilby's love--it amazes me. The set design is incredible, maybe better than that of the Blue Angel. But the real reason I love this film is Marian Marsh--I absolutely fell in love with her the first time I saw the movie and still feel that tingle even today! I never fell for any movie star but Marian Marsh--what absolute beauty with her coquette smile and sparkling eyes. Great story, great acting and great visuals, and \"Svengali\" is a part of American lexicon today because of this film version. This film is A+ in my book.", "This is a phenomenal movie. Great acting, great story, cool cinematography. Really worth the watch, and don't watch the 1983 remake with yucky Jodie Foster. Gag. She can't hold a candle to everything Marian Marsh brings to the character. Beauty, charm, grace, innocence and vulnerability. I can't believe Jodie could be hypnotized, and I can never \"forget\" the star, or she's always Clarice to me. John Barrymore is THE man. He's an amazingly good actor, and amusing to boot. That beard is so funny looking I can't take my eyes off it. He has the presence of a real star, yet we get lost in the character because he is such a GOOD actor. And look at how HUGE the hallways are in those Paris studios. And the costumes! A definite classic. Watch it, you'll love it.Read more of my public domain movie reviews at: http://pdmoviereview.blogspot.com/", "I'm so glad I recently had the chance to catch up with this film! John Barrymore is a joy to watch as the eccentric lead character, and the camera work and sets are second to none.I was particularly captivated with 16 year-old Marian Marsh as the feisty beauty, Trilby. This is the very picture of who the old song \"You're Sixteen\" was singing about in my book! Although this is not a horror film, it's recommended for fans who love the style of those old cherished Universal 30s classics."], "tt0022663": ["Jack Holt escapes from prison and follow the advice of his friend Boris Karloff to go see a certain man if he wants to remain free and make lots of money.

Holt however is no cook, he is instead a federal agent seeking to break a drug ring.Made prior to the release of Frankenstein this is a film with Boris Karloff in one of his henchmen supporting roles. He's good but a bit over active. The real star here is Jack Holt who was a big star in the silent days and who's career slowly faded once sound came in. I've always liked Holt and felt he was under appreciated by most people who know who he was (The problem is that most people have no idea at all who he was). Holt here is a rugged leading man and a nice man of action. He is in short the perfect hero.The film itself is quite good. Going from big house, to country house to doctors office, this is a thriller that keeps you guessing and keeps you interested. Its nice to see a movie that isn't so formulaic that you can connect the dots and know who is doing what before you're told. The action when it comes is well done and there is generally a good amount of suspense, especially in the final moments as it is uncertain if or how out hero will escape the villains clutches.Worth searching out and perfect for a nice double or triple feature on a dark and stormy night.", "Ah, there's nothing like a good old-fashioned creepy & atmospheric horror tale from the early nineteen-thirties starring the almighty Boris Karloff! Be forewarned, however, that this \"Behind the Mask\" is not really a horror movie and that Karloff in fact only plays a supportive character \u2013 albeit quite a menacing one. Does that mean that the film isn't worth checking out? Nope, not at all, because \"Behind the Mask\" definitely does contain quite a few sinister twists and details in its overall very ambitious and compelling crime/mystery screenplay. A whole bunch of elite federal agents are trying to unravel a large-scaled drug smuggling network led by the nefarious Mr. X. Special agent Jack Hart takes the identity of small thug Quinn and goes undercover in a state prison where he meets Jim Henderson (Karloff); one of Mr. X's principal henchmen. The organization of Mr. X is most certainly evil, as the criminal mastermind also runs an unorthodox clinic where the patients are murdered and their coffins stuffed with narcotics. The script from the hand of Jo Swerling \u2013 also the writer of Hitchcock's \"Lifeboat\" \u2013 superficially seems extremely ambitious, but rather many elements are nevertheless tacky (like the forced love-story between the secret agent and one of the minions' daughter) and/or predictable (for example the identity of Mr. X is not really that secretive). Top-billed stars Boris Karloff and Jack Holt are decent enough, but the show is stolen by Edward Van Sloan in a fiendish double role, and by Bertha Mann! She depicts a creepy maid who's strategically put in the house of Dr. X's unreliable collaborators. She closely observes everyone in the house and reports to her employer via a radio installation in her room.", "What must have started life as a pretty ordinary crime picture is dressed up for the box office with some of the popular flourishes of the day such as electronic gadgets and a mysterious criminal mastermind.Karloff gives excellent value as villain's chief henchman and thankfully gets plenty of screen time.Although director and cast were all well experienced in pictures, the performances tend to be on the dull side, particularly Jack Holt in the lead. The pace of individual scenes is a little slow too, almost as if everyone concerned were making a conscious effort to hold back from the excesses of the silent days.No classic, but you could do worse.", "A macabre mystery with many elements of the supernatural/shudder scientific genres.Boris Karloff plays a lead henchman in the service of a mysterious Mr. X. His performance does not suggest a red herring role, but he is sinister enough as a grim-faced gangster to keep one's interest throughout the picture. Early on, it seems possible that the sinister Dr. Steiner played by Edward van Sloan may seem to be a more likely candidate for Mr. X., but his performance raises enough doubts to keep the viewer in a constant state of suspense.A very fine \"B\" feature for the night owl crowd.7/10.Dan Basinger", "I forgot the director John Francis Dillon, he is lost now in moviegoers memory I guess, and I think it is a shame after watching this movie. This is not astounding but very worth the watch, with a good story, solid, unusual for the period. Pre Code film, it is authorized to predict many more things than one decade later. Yes, this is definitely an interesting little film from the thirties, early thirties, where it remains many more movies to find out. I am still amazed by this topic. Boris Karloff also shines in this non horror feature, and his role is rather important in this crime topic. He steals the place to Jack Holt.", "Jack Holt, at this time, was Columbia's top star, helping, along with Frank Capra, to catapult the studio into the \"almost\" big time with films like \"Submarine\", \"Flight\" and \"Dirigible\". He was also their workhorse and a funny running gag in the biography \"King Cohn\" had various male stars going to Harry Cohn for a raise, of which he would agree provided they \"don't tell Jack Holt\". Holt started work on his latest action film \"In the Secret Service\" in November 1931 but when \"Frankenstein\" proved such a big hit, the story was changed to incorporate some gruesome scenes to justify it's publicity as a horror film and given the more ambiguous title of \"Behind the Mask\".This has a definite feel of a cliffhanger serial condensed into an tight hour and is a terrific little movie. At the film's start Jack Holt, as Jack Hart is in prison and has made a confidante of Henderson (Boris Karloff). Hart is planning a breakout that night and Henderson, who is due to be released in the lawful way, is suitably impressed and thinks his organisation could use him. But Hart is a secret service man who is on the trail of the elusive Dr. X, whose identity is hidden even from his own gang members. He is given a job as a chauffeur to Arnold (Claude King), a gang member who is having second thoughts about his own involvement - not so his daughter, Julie (Constance Cummings) who makes a friend of Hart and tries to help him in every way. Ruling the house is the dreaded Edwards (Bertha Mann in her last film), the right hand woman of Dr. X, who, when people get too hard to handle, books them into Eastlake Hospital for an \"operation\".This opens up the film for some pretty grizzly scenes - dithering Arnold has already been taken to the hospital but is dead by the time Jack and Julie arrive. Julie is then rushed to hospital for an emergency appendectomy where she amazingly overpowers her captors and rushes to save Hart when he is just about to undergo an operation without the use of anesthetic!!! \"It is only when I begin to cut on the inside that you will realise an experience. To me it will be ecstasy\"!! - fiendish is not too strong a word for Dr. Steiner (Edward Van Sloane), whose evil characterization was up there with Dr. Fu Manchu and the crazed doctor in \"The Mystery of the Wax Museum\".A lot of action is packed into the hour, which again gives it a Saturday morning serial feel - an operative (Thomas Jackson, from \"Little Caesar\") walks off to his death, Hart's duplicity is discovered and Henderson arranges an \"accident\" at sea and Arnold's body is dug up, only to find his coffin is filled with drugs. Beautiful Constance Cummings was an asset to any movie, she had real intelligence and was not just a pretty face. She gives a lot more to her role than was originally there and really fleshes out her part.Highly Recommended.", "This film was made during the same period as \"The Criminal Code\" by the same studio. It also used some of the same sets and film footage. During this period,\"Frankenstein\" was released and Columbia decided to play up Karloff's name and the picture's horror aspects in the advertising. But technically, it is not a horror film.  It is exploited as another horror picture, this doesn't horrify sufficiently to class with preceding baby-scarers. The scare stuff seems tossed in regardless of where it fits, but it gets results because KARLOFF's threatening pan makes him a natural for his part.", "Although the film has Boris Karloff in it, he is not the star. Jack Holt stars in the movie though today few would recognize this star of the 1920s and 1930s. He died relatively young and his son, Tim, is more well known today.The film begins with Holt and Karloff in prison and they are talking about getting out--Holt is planning on breaking out and Karloff says he has some friends who will get him out, but is a bit evasive about what this means. A bit later, you see Holt pretending to escape--he apparently is some sort of government agent. Here is the crazy part--to make it look more realistic, he actually shoots himself in the arm in a scene that is a bit hard to watch. A short time later, Holt is able to insinuate himself into a criminal gang, as they buy his story about the escape. It seems that Holt's job is to infiltrate the gang headed by the mysterious 'Mr. X'! For the most part, this is a mindless sort of adventure film--the sort that makes no sense but has one crazy cliff-hanger sort of scene after another. It makes for a brainless but interesting sort of movie--the sort that kids at the time would have liked and parents would have tolerated (or at least tried). When seen today, however, I can't see anyone particularly enjoying this tripe--especially since Karloff lovers like myself just won't get enough of the actor's performance to make it worth our time. Cheap and silly--with little to recommend it.", "1932's \"Behind the Mask\" was the earliest Columbia title included in the hugely successful SON OF SHOCK television package of the late 1950s, reteaming Boris Karloff and Edward Van Sloan following the just-completed \"Frankenstein\" (shooting wrapped Nov 21 1931). Headlining is the studio's top workhorse, Jack Holt (father of Tim), playing an undercover FBI agent posing as a convict, pumping information from Jim Henderson (Karloff), part of the dope smuggling ring run by a mysterious 'Mr. X.' The somewhat dim Henderson hardly taxes Boris, who virtually disappears at the midway point (we later learn of his offscreen capture); the real revelation is seeing Edward Van Sloan in dual roles- he looks like himself in two scenes as Dr. Alec Munsell, involved in the FBI investigation, but is unrecognizable in heavy beard and glasses as Dr. August Steiner, chewing the scenery with great relish. It's a juicy, scene stealing villain, sounding very much like an evil Van Helsing, able to lawfully dispose of enemies through surgery on the operating table, rather than wielding a knife in the street, which would only attract attention. Lovely Constance Cummings finishes her third film opposite Karloff, following \"The Criminal Code\" and \"The Guilty Generation,\" while Thomas Jackson, shortly after his successful pursuit of Edward G. Robinson's \"Little Caesar,\" surprisingly comes to a bad end. Jack Holt went on to work with Bela Lugosi in a later Columbia, 1935's \"The Best Man Wins\" (and with John Carradine in 1942's MGM \"Northwest Rangers\"). Many viewers, particularly Karloff fans, grouse that it's not really a horror film, but there's certainly enough horrific touches to qualify for SON OF SHOCK, a solid pre-code melding of crime and chills. \"Behind the Mask\" made one appearance on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater, July 8 1967 (followed by 1961's Mexican \"Bring Me The Vampire\").", "BEHIND THE MASK (Columbia, 1932), directed by John Francis Dillon, with its Halloween sounding title and Boris Karloff in the cast, one should be expecting a horror movie. Released a little after his overnight success as The Monster in FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1931), naturally the Karloff name was its selling point, even if Karloff assumes third billing under its leading players, Jack Holt and Constance Cummings. Having some Columbia releases to his name where Karloff was not yet an established screen personality, he did make an impression in a prior prison melodrama of THE CRIMINAL CODE (1930), which lead to other films for that studio before acquiring immortality at Universal where 1932 released such memorable Karloff performances in his newfound genre of mystery and horror as THE OLD DARK HOUSE and THE MUMMY. While BEHIND THE MASK belongs mostly to Jack Holt, it's often categorized as a Karloff motion picture.The story introduces two men, Quinn (Jack Holt) and Jim Henderson (Boris Karloff), prisoners at Sing Sing Prison, conversing during recreation period where Henderson, expecting to be \"sprung out\" any day now, tells Quinn where they are to meet upon his release. Later, Quinn breaks out of prison. During a heavy rain storm, he arranges a self-inflicted gunshot wound on his shoulder to gain access into the Arnold household. Posing as an escaped convict hiding from the police, Quinn gains enough sympathy and treatment from Julie (Constance Cummings). It so happens that Quinn, actually Jack Hart of the Secret Service, assigned under Captain E.J. Hawkes (Willard Robertson), is there to learn about her father's (Claude King) activities and his possible connection with a narcotics ring leader, the mysterious Mr. X, whom he and anyone else associated in his operation of illegal activities, has never seen. Taken under Julies confidence, Hart remains, working as her personal chauffeur. Also employed at the Arnold household is Edwards (Bertha Mann), a housekeeper and undercover spy reporting her daily activities by telephone where the recording is saved onto Mr. X's hidden dicta-phone. After Henderson's release, he reports to his physician, August Steiner (Edward Van Sloan), also part of the narcotics ring, where he resumes his activities as the doctor's henchman. After three murders on those coming close to learning the identity of Mr. X, the fourth victim being Inspector Burke (Thomas E. Jackson), it's not up to Hart to fulfill his mission to expose the identity of Mr. X before any more lives are lost, including his own.Often exploited as a horror film, especially when sold to television in the late 1950s as part of its weekly horror film night festivals, the only elements BEHIND THE MASK has pertaining to thrillers include scenes involving digging up a body from a cemetery to perform an autopsy, and another where the hidden faced Mr. X attempts to do away with one of his victims tied down on an operating table, otherwise BEHIND THE MASK is simply a spy mystery. It's also one of the very few of many Jack Holt programmers during his Columbia period (1929-1940) to be leased to television, yet, with conflicting movies bearing the same title, ranging from a 1946 Monogram/\"Shadow\" mystery, the 1958 British made melodrama starring Michael Redgrave, or even the extended THE FACE BEHIND THE MASK (1941) with Peter Lorre, many of which have stirred up confusion on the TV Guide listings back in the sixties and seventies when any one of these titles aired in place over the 1932 edition. BEHIND THE MASK of 1932 did become part of New York City's own \"Creature Feature Theater\" where I finally got to see it occasionally during its semi-annual broadcasts between 1974 and 1980.Regardless of its flaws, Karloff slightly miscast as an off-camera murderous henchman with little to do by the midway point; Constance Cummings doing her part as the fur coat wearing heroine concerned about the outcome of both her father and new chauffeur; and Edward Van Sloan in a sort of role that definitely would have been Karloff's had BEHIND THE MASK been produced during his \"mad scientist\" period of the late 1930s, the film, overall, is not bad.Never distributed to home video, BEHIND THE MASK has come around in recent years on Turner Classic Movies (2009-11), equipped with 1940s Columbia logo insertion lifted from its latter theatrical reissues, still remains a forgotten item from the Columbia library, filmography of Jack Holt and especially Boris Karloff, whom, without Karloff in the cast, BEHIND THE MASK would either be lost to oblivion or available and forgotten in some dark movie vault. (** masks)", "More plot holes than a 12 chapter serial, this crime drama is a disappointment because of its massive convoluted attempt at telling a story. Aging hero Jack Holt is a double agent, in prison on an attempt to foil a drug ring. He leads fellow prisoner Boris Karloff into a trap along with crooked doctor Edward Van Sloan. Karloff quickly figures out what Hokt is up to but his attempts at silencing him are quickly prevented by a magical dummy. Pretending to be dead gives Holt a chance to expose the crooked men behind this plot as well as move in on the pretty heroine, Constance Cummings, whose father is an unwilling participant.Made at first to look like a spooky thriller, complete with an imperious nurse who is always lurking, this suffers from very slow pacing and monotone line delivery. One of the least interesting of pre-code crime dramas, this wouldn't even be a curiosity if it wasn't for the presence of Karloff in a supporting role.", "Behind the Mask (1932)** 1/2 (out of 4)Columbia action picture has Jack Holt playing Secret Agent Jack Hart who goes undercover in a prison and befriends the henchman (Boris Karloff) of a maniac passing off various narcotics on the street. Hart isn't able to find his identity but he begins to grow suspicious of a doctor (Edward Van Sloan) who seems to be hiding a few things. Footage from the same studio's THE CRIMINAL CODE was used here as well as several sets from that film so fans of that film might be curious to check this one out, which turns out to be fairly entertaining even though a stronger director probably would have gotten more out of it and raised it beyond its \"B\" movie roots. What works best is the cast, which also includes Constance Cummings as the lose interest for our main hero. She's pretty good in the film and has wonderful chemistry with Holt whose as stiff as ever but still manages to turn in a good performance. It appears people either love Holt or hate him but I'm somewhere in between. I have often been put off by his stiffness but I think it actually suits his character here quite well. Karloff gets a pretty good role and manages to be in the majority of the first half of the picture. He too makes the film worth checking out as he proves once again that he could do a wide range of roles and didn't require make up to do them. Fans of FRANKENSTEIN will certainly like seeing him and Van Sloan together again. The story itself is pretty simple and straight forward and really doesn't add too many twists or shocks that can't be spotted from a mile away. The film runs a fast paced 68-minutes, which doesn't leave the viewer too many dull moments. Again, I think a stronger director could have rises the material up some but fans of the cast will certainly want to check this one out.", "If you go into this movie expecting Karloff to steal the show, you might feel disappointed. Before horror, gangster and crime dramas were his main genre. My favorite was the Criminal Code with respect to Karloff's appearance. In this movie, he isn't the main villain or even a show-stealer. The main villain is actually played by someone who is known as a hero in Universal Monster Movies, Edward Van Sloan. To me, that helped save the movie for obscurity.It's interesting to note that studios tried to cash in on the movie with the notion that people would see it because of Karloff's casting. This must've been underwhelming though. This film was interesting plot-wise, but it would have done nothing for the famed actor's career had it been shot prior to Frankenstein.", "Behind the Mask's plot can't be taken seriously and there aren't any laughs or thrills.Overall it's somewhat amusing, because it's bad. There's a lot going on, but little investment in anything. I mean, the lead and undercover agent climbs into the window of the daughter and then becomes the chauffeur.. meanwhile a known spy lives there... It's a shambles.", "This is real Saturday matin\u00e9e serial stuff, the nonsense plot complete with a drug-running gang of baddies in thrall to a nameless boss that they contact by leaving a message on a primitive Dictaphone's answering machine. Holt is pathetic as a secret service man supposedly infiltrating the gang. Van Sloan plays a villainous M.D. who, for no reason that's apparent, spends his spare time hovering in a room with flashing lights and a Jacob's ladder. His make-up and accent have a distinctly Semitic (or anti-Semitic) shade, but his is the only performance of much interest in the film. The finale does have a nice moment. As Van Sloan prepares to perform a fatal operation on Holt, without anesthesia, he says, \"You will be able to bear the pain as I cut through your skin\" (demonstrating long cut with finger). \"It is only when I cut into your inner parts that you will realize that you are HAVING AN EXPERIENCE!\" He then quotes Nietzsche on unbearable pain, and says, \"We will find out if this is merely an aphorism.\" In a intentionally cute switch, it is the girl who saves the nearly nude man bound to the operating table. (That's about all the talented Constance Cummings is given to do in this film.) The explanation of her sudden appearance\u0096\"How did you get here?\" \"His gun dropped to the floor and I grabbed it.\"\u0096is about as perfunctory as the rest of the film. Is the leader of the Citizens Reform Committee secretly the head of the gang? What do YOU think?", "This is a film that I didn't know about until going through Letterboxd for horror from 1932. Seeing that this was another Boris Karloff movie that I could tick off my list was good enough for me. I'll be honest, coming in I didn't know a lot and it was just the next one up.Synopsis: an undercover federal officer serving time in prison fakes his escape to infiltrate a heroin smuggling ring.I'll be honest, I came into this one blind. I didn't read the synopsis. I just knew that it was on YouTube and the aspects above. We start with Quinn (Jack Holt) talking to Jim Henderson (Karloff). They're in prison and have time in the yard. Quinn reveals that night he is breaking out. Jim tries to change his mind, saying that he has powerful friends who are getting him out soon. Quinn states he cannot wait for that. Jim does offer him a job when he gets out.We then shift to a house that belongs to Arnold (Claude King). He lives there with his daughter Julie (Constance Cummings). Watching over them is a Nurse Edwards (Bertha Mann). They both feel like a prisoner as she reports to an evil crime boss who is known as Mr. X. During this night, Quinn makes his escape and is shot in the process. He seeks refuge with the Arnolds and this makes Nurse Edwards suspicious. She also takes notice when Arnold is strongarmed over the phone by Agent Burke (Thomas E. Jackson).Jim then gets out and meets with a Dr. August Steiner (Edward Van Sloan). During their meeting, Dr. Steiner notices that he has a tail and they need to lose him. Before they part ways, Jim relays about Quinn and they hire him for a job that involves the latter flying a plane over the ocean to pick up a shipment of drugs.Not everyone is as they seem though. Quinn is Jack Hart, the federal agent from the synopsis. He isn't the only double agent though. No matter what the feds try to do, the criminals seem to be one step ahead of them. They might also be on to Jack as well.That should be enough to recap the story and introduce our characters. Where I'll start is what I've noticed about many of the last movies I've watched from 1932. They are light on the horror elements in them. This is to the point that I'm not sure I would consider them in genre if they were made today. I do think this one goes a bit more into horror than some, but still light on the elements.Where I'll delve then first would be into this criminal organization. This movie is pointing out some commentary that I saw in a subtle way. The first would be in prison. It is interesting to see how lax the system is, but it makes sense how strict they are now. What I was getting at though is Quinn and Jim becoming friends. My problem with the prison system is that I don't think it works. Without going too political, I know that it is a broken system that is using slave labor. My true issue is that we are putting criminals together, allowing them to interact and then making their lives harder when they're released. They are institutionalized to needing the structure to keep them out of trouble. Finding work after when they are convicted felons isn't easy. We see what happens here. Quinn joins Mr. X's crew and Jim isn't rehabilitated when he gets out. He goes right back to what he is doing before in crime. There aren't a lot of people who would hire him and this is still an issue. It is wild this movie is 90+ years old and the concept is still relevant. I would say even more so today.Getting into why I consider this horror is where I'll take this next. Mr. X deals in drugs. That would be a terrifying life of crime to be involved in. What I like is that he has a doctor working under him of Dr. Steiner. We see the depths this guy will go. Patients are brought into his private hospital and he can keep them quiet. That is terrifying to me. The movie is interesting as they don't suspect a doctor could be behind something like this. I think that idea comes from it being a profession we should trust. We would see in the years to come that there are doctors who are psycho or sociopaths who were serial killers. I like that the movie is exploring this idea. Another aspect to go along with this that is scary is being undercover. We know at one point that Mr. X and his crew has taken out multiple federal agents. Trying to live a double life where you could die scares me and I can see the horror there.There isn't anything else I need to flesh out for the story so I'll go over to the acting. I thought that Holt does well as portraying the rough criminal Quinn as well as the tough federal agent in Jack. He fits for the chess game that he is playing to stay alive. Cummings is fine. She isn't given a lot and is more of the love interest for him. Being that her father is in too deep does add tension for her worry. Karloff is solid in his side character. I like seeing him given a bit to work with. King, Mann, Willard Robertson and Thomas E. Jackson are all solid as well. Another actor though I was impressed with as Van Sloan. He's given more here than other film I've seen him in. It is a shame he seems to be regulated to minor characters as he is good as a villain.The last things then would be the filmmaking. I think that we get good cinematography here. There are only a few set pieces we see. I did like what they did with the ocean sequences. Other than that, they don't do anything too out of the ordinary. It is limited on the effects used, but it also isn't that type of movie. How things play out before the characters is more important. The only other thing would be the soundtrack. It didn't stand out or hurt the movie for how it was used.In conclusion, this movie was interesting enough. I like the different elements we have come into a play with this early crime film that incorporates some horror elements. Having a double agent infiltrating this crime organization was good. Using a killer doctor is an intriguing element there. I'd say that the acting was solid across the board. This movie is well made as well. After this first viewing, I would say this is an above average movie for me. I'd recommend it for the cast and the elements for a movie this early into cinema.My Rating: 7 out of 10."], "tt0022776": [], "tt0022827": ["Wow, what a shock - a 1932 color movie! Well, sort of......only two colors, but they look great.I only got this because I saw it at the library as part of a two-pack with \"The Return Of Dr. X.\" It is part of a Hollywood \"Legends Of Horror\" package that includes several other films I am familiar with and think highly of, so I can see a possible future purchase.Anyway, the first thing that struck me watching this was that fantastic two-strip Technicolor. Immediately there is a street scene of green and brown that looks tremendous....and eerie. You would think that only black-and-white might make this look eerie, but not so - that combination of green and brown was very effective and made this a fascinating visual film. Hats off to the UCLA film restoration team, which made this 75-year-old film look really good.As for the story, well, let's just say it doesn't measure up to the visuals. It starts off looking like a fun movie, even - surprise - a comedy as the newsman \"Lee Taylor\" (Lee Tracy) cracks a few corny jokes. However, it settles down into a crime story (more than horror) and we wind up with a whodunit and a room full of suspects, a la Charlie Chan or Sherlock Holmes. The suspects are all scientists working in the Academy of Surgical Research. A bunch of recent hideous crimes by the \"Moon Killer\" were all done in the vicinity of the academy, so they're the prime suspects. Even the head man at the academy, \"Dr. Xavier,\" looks a bit suspicious. He is played well by Lionel Atwill.The police give \"Dr. X\" 48 hours to find out if any of his employees are the killer before they totally take over the investigation and ruin the reputation of the scientific institution. All of the scientists, by the way, look and act creepy which adds to the mystery. Heck, they all could be serial killers.The film drags during much of that period - except for a short testing session that Dr. X sets up to see if any of his subordinates are, indeed, the killer. Apparently, it's true because someone kills one of the suspects during the experiment! Then there is another long lull and the cops are getting impatient with the good doctor. They give him another ultimate so he \"tests\" his employees again, this time using his daughter \"Joanne\" (Fay Wray) as a guinea pig, so to speak.Then, we finally see who the real killer is and that part is fun to watch and he transforms into a hideous monster-like man. I guess this why the film is called a horror film instead of a crime movie. I won't give the ending away but I admit, it's pretty good.If that long middle part had been spiced up a bit, this would have super, but it was too talky for too long. Still, this isn't bad and I love those two colors. I wish more movies looked like that.", "DOCTOR X is one of those heartbreaking films to watch for a fan of old horror movies, because it has so many wonderful things going for it yet just narrowly misses the mark of being really good due to a liability or two which could have been avoided. As is so often the case with early '30s fright films like this, the need was felt to add a \"funnyman\" to the proceedings to perhaps give audiences of the day a chance to laugh along with being scared. The culprit in this case is Lee Tracy, who plays a typical golden age newspaper reporter who snoops around and gets his nose tangled into everyone's business.The \"business\" at hand is a string of killings in New York regarding a fiend who strangles people and then apparently cannibalizes them. Dr. Xavier (the always enjoyable Lionel Atwill) heads a group of doctors who are all suspects up for scrutiny, and though we have to deal with the frequent lapses into silliness from Mr. Tracy, this old chestnut is interesting and gripping a fair amount of its running time. Director Michael Curtiz does a fine job of visually entertaining us with strange angles, quick closeups and flashy set designs. An added delight is the early use of two-strip color that gives the film a rather eerie dimension with its muted greens. Fay Wray (KING KONG) steps into another early horror picture here, but really doesn't have much to do and isn't of much use to the story. There's a completely out of place beach scene with Wray and Tracy that will leave you wondering who thought it shouldn't be left on the cutting room floor (perhaps it was an excuse to get a pantie shot of Fay as she sunbathes under her big beach umbrella).The film's strongest moment comes in a revelation sequence late in the movie where we finally get to see who the crazed murderer is, and it's still chilling even now to watch him go through his insane routine. You're bound to have the words \"synthetic flesh\" etched into your subconscious for a long time after seeing DOCTOR X, and if there's one thing you'll remember, this will be it. **1/2 out of ****", "The police are investigating a series of murders where victims have been cut up by scalpel and cannibalized. The murders always take place on a night with a full moon. They trace the scalpels to a nearby surgical academy. The head of the academy, Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill), doesn't believe someone at the academy is the killer and asks police for a chance to prove this using his own scientific methods. Also on the trail of the killer is reporter Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy). Taylor is suspicious of Doctor Xavier but when he meets the doctor's daughter (Fay Wray) he becomes smitten. Allowed only 48 hours to prove his case, Xavier gathers all the suspects at his mansion to perform his experiment. But things don't go as planned and another murder is committed.Doctor X is a classic horror-mystery that has many points of interest for film fans. For starters, the two-color Technicolor process it was filmed in was new for the time. It also has great Max Factor makeup that looks especially nice in the early Technicolor. Another thing, it's a pre-Code film. Cannibalism, a major part of the plot, wouldn't have been allowed just a short time later. Lastly it's the horror debut of one of the greats of the genre, Lionel Atwill. Atwill would go on to a great career making many horror films, including two more with Wray the following year. He always brought class and dignity to his usually villainous roles. He's great here as well.The major complaint about the film seems to be directed at Lee Tracy's comic character. He is probably the worst part of the movie, but not because his performance is bad. He does fine with what he's supposed to do. It's just that comedy in horror films is usually best left to minor supporting roles not for the male lead in the film. However, I personally feel he's not obnoxious enough to hurt the film significantly. It's still very fun and very interesting, both from a film history perspective as well as sheer entertainment value. I would recommend all fans of classic horror films check it out.", "Old dark house thrillers were all the rage in the early talkie era. Doctor X combines a spooky old house with a mad scientist horror story, and as directed by Michael Curtiz in early two-strip Technicolor, it's a quite good show even by today's standards.Lionel Atwill's Doctor X is a scientist who runs a medical research institute in New York City near where a series of grisly murders have recently occurred. He and his entire teaching staff are suspects in the case, as the police have determined that the killer has some medical knowledge. The ever-helpful doctor seeks to prove the authorities wrong, and transports his staff to the cliffside manor, Blackstone Shoals, to prove them wrong, and gets more than he bargained for.Newspaperman Lee Tracy is along for the ride, and can't seem to keep his mouth shut, as he continually makes wisecracks. His character is utterly of the time, and as such a fascinating glimpse of a bygone type, both of real life and the movies. Fay Wray is her usual lissome self, with her peculiarly gyrating physicality far more interesting than her delivery of dialog. She's a brunette here, and proves herself once again filmdom's definitive Scream Queen, on at least one occasion shrieking with no provocation whatsoever, as if in preparation for the horror to come.For a 1932 movie, this one moves quickly. There are enough dour and sinister-looking suspects to keep one guessing the identity of the murderer till near the end. Curtiz shows an often sadistic sense of humor, as when several suspects are manacled to their chairs to witness reenactment of one of the murders, only to have the real killer turn up! The director's control of the material is complete, and he shows himself once more one of great unsung masters of the studio era.", "Don't even try to compare this wonderful old WArner Brothers thriller from l934 with today's thrillers. It was made at a time long gone when atmosphere, sets, lighting and camerawork were king. I adore getting this movie out at least once a month along with \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" and \"Night Monster\" (another reviewer has also cited \"Night Monster\" as the classic it is)turn out the lights and lose myself in the early Technicolor two-strip photographey which is beautifully pastel and atmospheric in its eerie greens, pinks, crimson and gold. The Anton Grot sets are unforgettable. The cast of Hollywood's greatest character actors throw themselves into their roles (I doubt they had any other choice. After all, the demonic Michael Curtiz was cracking the whip as director). Fay Wray is pretty and screams now and then. Most irritating of all is Lee Tracey as the relentlessly wise-cracking reporter. Glenda Farrell had the same role in \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" also filmed in early color and she was fantastic. A great old thriller, set in a remote mansion by the sea.  The monster is terrifying. Ironically, you never see any carnage, blood or torture. Hats off to those long-ago film masters who knew how to do things right.", "When you think of it, everything about this film is strictly synthetic...the plot, the hokey comic relief, the occasional ham acting--but the atmosphere photographed in crisp looking two-strip Technicolor is fully charged and the taut direction of Michael Curtiz (long before he did another more polished noir called THE UNSUSPECTED), makes this a very watchable early horror film from Warner Bros.The Anton Grot sets in early color will keep the viewer totally enhanced even when the plot holes become too obvious. The annoying comic relief supplied by Lee Tracy as a fast-talking newspaperman (was there any other kind?), is fortunately not much of a handicap when the cast includes an assortment of richly eccentric characters.I have to confess I guessed who the murderer was from the start--but it didn't dampen my enjoyment of the melodramatic and very creepy events. The storyline concerns a killer known for striking when there's a full moon and Lionel Atwill is the doctor who thinks he can solve the crime by some scientific detective work of his own.It's the sort of film that became a staple of the \"old dark house\" mysteries audiences loved in the '20s and '30s--and even into the '40s with films like THE CAT AND THE CANARY. None of it seems quite as compelling as some of the better known fright films (including MURDER IN THE WAX MUSEUM), but we do get a chance to hear some first rate screams from Fay Wray (who looks very attractive in close-ups even though the Max Factor make-up is a little too extreme), and the capable cast includes such sturdy performers as Lionel Atwill and Preston Foster.Trivia note: The killer's synthetic flesh make-up is very effective when he's in full mode on the kill. Kudos to Michael Curtiz for a fun-filled fright film.", "The fact that Doctor X was shot in color was pretty rare in 1932 with most of the studios existing from day to day during the Depression. Very few had money to splurge on something like this. Knowing that I'm surprised Warner Brothers didn't bother to use it on one of their Busby Berkeley spectaculars.There have been a string of mutilation killings in New York, really horrible stuff and forensics has determined the weapon used was a special kind of surgical scalpel only in use at a particular scientific institute. The one headed by Doctor Xavier the Doctor X of the movie title.Atwill's got some pull with the cops because they allow him 48 hours to find who the killer is and save his institute some scandalous press. The press is in the form of Lee Tracy a determined reporter who sneaks into the institute looking for the inside scoop. He meets up with Fay Wray who is Atwill's daughter, but even she doesn't deter him from his mission.Horror stories were not the Warner Brothers specialty and when you consider what was coming out of Universal at the time, Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Mummy, Doctor X looks pretty second rate besides them. No monsters in this film except the truly monstrous human being who is doing all the homicides.Warner Brothers seven years later did The Return Of Doctor X which has absolutely nothing to do with this film and provided Humphrey Bogart with one of the worst roles in his career. Next to that one, Doctor X is like Citizen Kane.", "As a collector of old mystery-horror-comedy films (over 700 in my collection!), \"Dr. X\" (& \"Night Monster\") rank as my Top Two Films of All-Time!  And, that's quite a statement!Why? The marvellously spooky sets by Anton Grot, the superstitious antics of the maid, plus the ad-libbing of Lee Tracey make this film a gem!  The entire film is extremely \"atmospheric\" and the effects of the \"monster\" shadows on the walls, clutching hands, wind (machines!), and all the rest really add to it!Sometimes I watch this film just to observe the SETS!(If you see it, watch the scene where Lee Tracey is trying to get into the house on Blackstone Shoals....the \"wind\" is howling like crazy, but not many of the trees are moving! I LOVE it!)If possible, try to watch this film in the original tri-color technicolor version, as it's a lot better!A wonderfully creepy film!", "A creepy laboratory where eccentric doctors engage in bizarre experiments. An intrepid reporter & a beautiful young woman involving themselves in terrible danger. And a fiendish strangler who only strikes during the full moon...DOCTOR X does have an absurd plot, but it is undeniably entertaining to watch. Much of the credit for this must go to the look of the film. Art Director Anton Grot designed some very spooky interior sets. The Max Factor make-up is striking. And both elements are enhanced because this was one of the first movies to be shot in two-strip Technicolor.Lee Tracy, one of the most enjoyable actors of the early 1930's, plays another in his long line of fast-talking wise-crackers - this time a newspaperman out to get a big story. Fay Wray is lovely as always & gets to use her famous scream (a year before KING KONG). Lionel Atwill hams it up a bit as the instigator of many of the more unusual elements in the plot.", "...Seriously! This girl (Fay Wray) needs some heavy duty nerve tonic! Dad on a ladder in the library frightens her but a stranger found ransacking her bedroom is subject to catty teasing remarks? Somebody lecture this woman on stranger danger. But I'll get back to that later. First some background on the film.This and \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\" were made as horror movies because Warner Brothers was on the hook to the Technicolor corporation to make two more two strip technicolor films. These were planned to be musicals, but with musicals out of favor, they decided to make them horror films instead. Wax Museum was pretty good, but this film turned out neither scary nor suspenseful.The \"moon killer\" is killing somebody by the light of the full moon every full moon. The victims have all been strangled and had a surgical instrument inserted at the base of the skull. The latest victim has been cannibalized. Apparently, after the sixth victim six months into this, the police decide to get serious about this spree. Why now? Why not after the third victim three months ago? Question never asked or answered. The police have traced the surgical instrument involved in the murders down as something only sold to and used at Dr. Xavier's (Lionel Atwill's) research institute, thus somebody at the institute must be the murderer. Dr. Xavier doesn't want any publicity, so he gets the police to...agree to let him do the investigation??? And why did they let somebody who they already suspect - Dr. Xavier - autopsy the sixth victim? What kind of police department is this? But I digress.Meanwhile there is a fast talking reporter (Lee Tracy) investigating this without Tracy's trademark finesse and rapid fire delivery which he develops later in his career. He actually goofs up quite a bit and isn't the wily fellow he is in \"Blessed Event\" or \"Bombshell\". And what is his obsession with that hand buzzer of his?The good things about this film - Lionel Atwill is always scary and ambiguous in these old horror films even if the film itself is not. The art design is very good considering Warner Brothers was just a poverty row outfit five years before. Michael Curtiz' crisp direction goes a long way given the mediocre plot line he is given to work with. But maybe a plot where looking into the night sky lit up by the moon is a key part of several scenes was a bad idea when that sky can only look slimy green given the technology of the time.Probably worth a look for Lee Tracy fans, and who isn't one?", "Not wholly creak-free (Lee tracy's performance is notably of it's time), but still with some marvellous moments. The legendary \"synthetic flesh\" scene is still totally shocking and bizarre, worth the price of admission alone. Definitely one for the collection.", "I just love these old, dark house style horror/mystery/thrillers from the 30s. In this one, Lionel Atwill plays Dr. Xavier, the head of a surgical research institute. A series of brutal killings committed by a gruesome figure, nicknamed the 'Moon Killer', points to someone within the institute. The police allow Dr. X the chance to perform an experiment to uncover the killer. Dr. X decides to move the experiment to an old, dark house in order to avoid the prying eyes of the press. The 'press' is played by Lee Tracy in that 30s wise-cracking, fast-talking way that all newspaper men were portrayed. (I was immediately reminded of Glenda Farrell from The Mystery of the Wax Museum, only in this case Lee Tracy is even more annoying.) As the experiment begins, it soon become apparent that the police were right. Someone within the house is a killer, but who? Any more of the story would be too much.Although the movie is not without flaws, I found Doctor X very enjoyable. The supporting cast includes Fay Wray as Dr. X's daughter. She does her best to prove she was the original 'scream queen'. Also, the staff members/suspects are all wonderfully played in eccentric fashion.Other things I enjoyed and found to be above average were the set design and the makeup. The set design is impressive. The manor house has everything one comes to expect in this kind of movie. It only adds to the wonderful atmosphere. Also, I felt the makeup (done by Max Factor) was ahead of its time. I found it far more frightening than most movies from this period.The director, Michael Curtiz, does a wonderful job of building the tension in the final scenes. Very impressive. I really can't say enough about how well he pulled this together with the seemingly limited budget he was working with. (BTW, Curtiz went on to direct such a variety of movies that it really boggles the mind. Included on his resume are the previously mention Mystery of the Wax Museum, The Walking Dead with Boris Karloff, Casablanca, and Elvis in King Creole.)", "By the late 20s, Warner Brothers had already become a major studio thanks to the enormous success of their revolutionary \"talking pictures\", finally delivering fully synchronized sound and dialogs that could be heard. Soon after this, Warner moved to color as their new novelty, and using the advanced Technicolor Process 3 (which allowed a better use of their two color technology), the studio released a wide variety of films that looked better than the previous Technicolor films, creating a new revolution of almost the same impact as the creation of the \"talkies\". Among those films was the 1932 tale of horror and mystery, \"Doctor X\", directed by Michael Curtiz, who in those years was still one of the many studio directors at Warner. Mainly known for his effective (always on time and under budget) and versatile work, this would become the film that proved that this Hungarian immigrant had a style of his own and was able to make films of great success.There is a serial killer on the loose in New York, committing his cannibalistic murders using a scalpel with surgical precision, and always under the light of the full moon, earning the moniker of \"The Moon Killer\". While the police still has no idea of who the killer is, they know one important thing about him: the killer works as a scientist at the Academy of Surgical Research. The Academy's director, Dr. Jerry Xavier (Lionel Atwill), decides that in order to avoid any bad reputation for the Academy, he must find who the killer is among the suspects, and asks the Police Commisoner for time to carry on an experiment. Gathering his four comrades in his old mansion, Xavier will try to discover the identity of the killer, as anyone could be the murderer, including himself. At the same time, a wisecracking reporter named Lee (Lee Tracy) finds himself trying to discover what's the mystery at Xavier's Mansion.The screenplay for \"Doctor X\" was written by Robert Tasker and Earl Baldwin as an adaptation of a moderately successful three-act play by Howard W. Comstock and Allen C. Miller. The story remained faithful to the mix of mystery, comedy and horror that was popular in that kind of plays, but Tasker and Baldwin enhanced the horror elements of the story, clearly in an attempt to equal the success of Universal's horror movies. While the plot is indeed more focused on horror (including detailed, although not graphic, descriptions of rape and cannibalism), the story remains true to its origins as a play with the inclusion of lighthearted comedy in the shape of Lee, the wisecracking reporter, whose comedic exploits serve to break the tension at several points of the film. While nothing really amazing by today's standards, the story still works very well, with some cleverly written twists and unexpected surprises that spice up the plot.While the plot sounds definitely like another of those \"old dark house\" thrillers that were so popular in the 30s, the execution of the film is what truly sets it apart from the rest. For starters, Warner Bros' decision of making \"Doctor X\" part of their series of Technicolor films allowed director Curtiz to be able to work with the now legendary cinematographer Ray Rennahan, and together they crafted very atmospheric images of haunting beauty. Rennahan's skills with color cinematography works perfectly together with Curtiz' expressionist background in the making of a fast-packed, yet beautifully looking story. As a director, Curtiz was still far from becoming the master who directed \"Casablanca\", but his classy style can already be seen raw in this movie.Another of the high points in the film is the casting, starting with Lionel Atwill as Dr. Xavier. Atwill delivers a terrific performance, completely owning his character and giving it a subtle feeling of impeding doom, adding a lot of emotion to the film. Fay Wray is also very good, although like Lee Taylor, doesn't really have anything to do besides playing a stereotype. Preston Foster, John Wray, Harry Beresford and Edmund Carewe are pleasant surprises, each giving their own quirky character a distinct look, and like Atwill, make very believable suspects of the heinous crimes. Finally, George Rosener and Leila Bennett have small, yet very funny scenes that add a lot to the black comedy aspect of the film, and personally, I found them infinitely better than Fay Wray and Lee Tracy.\"Doctor X\" is a film that has aged badly, showing a style of mystery stories that is not popular anymore after countless of imitations and variations on the same subject. Lee Tracy's comedic performance is also another of the film's details that nowadays look silly and out of place ( Glenda Farrell would do a better work in a similar role in \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\", the following year), although then again, this kind of over-the-top performances were the standard of comedy/horrors of those years. It is clear that \"Doctor X\" is definitely not a classic of the genre in the sense of being innovative or groundbreaking, however, I think that the superb execution of the whole film really sets it apart from the rest, and gives it a special charm that it's hard to ignore.It's safe to say that this movie pales in comparison to some of the best Universal's horrors of those years, and that the cast and crew of this film surpassed themselves the following year with \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\", completely overshadowing this film; however, \"Doctor X\" is an enjoyable movie that shows the days of experimentation with color, and the style of horror of the years prior to the Hays Code. While not a life changing experience, \"Doctor X\" is a perfect film for a dark atmospheric night, where its haunting colors can shine the most. 7/10", "Very slow, creaky early two-color horror film. It's often paired with \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\". \"Mystery\" is very good--this isn't.There is someone going around killing people and then (partially) devouring certain parts of their body. They only do it when there's a full moon out and all the murders happen near an academy run by Dr. Xavier (Lionel Atwill). The police are certain that the killer is one of the doctors at the academy. Xavier says he'll figure out who the killer is within 48 hours. News reporter Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy) tries to find out what's going on. Also Fay Wray is around as Xavier's daughter Joanne.The story is VERY slow moving (even at 77 minutes) and full of plot holes, unexplained occurrences (I'm still trying to figure out who gassed Tracey and why he was where he was at the end) and truly bizarre situations. Ever worse is the alleged comedy from Tracy. He's just simply not funny and his wisecracks get on your nerves. The best part of the picture is the unmasking of the killer on a dark and stormy night in a castle(!!!). Lionel Atwill (an excellent actor) seems bored in the lead role and Fay Wray (another good actor) does her best but can't overcome the script. To cap it off Warner released in on DVD in a version that looks terrible. The two color Technicolor looks washed out so badly that some scenes appear to be in black & white!On the plus side, it DOES look great and hearing Wray rip out a few good, loud screams is always kind of fun. And Max Factor did the makeup! Still it's really slow going. \"Ssssynthetic flessshhh!\"", "There are Many Enjoyable Elements Incorporated in this Early Talkie/Technicolor Horror Movie. It is Directed with Flair and Style from One of Hollywood's Elite, Michael Curtiz and Shot in a Two-Strip Color Process that was Rare at the Time.It has Horror Icon's Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray.

Rather than use older, more costly period piece backdrops for their horror movie stories, Warner Brothers innovatively(and frugally I might add) decided to use modern settings and modern \"monsters.\" Doctor X is a fast-paced thriller about a moon killer that strangles his victims and uses a very sharp surgical instrument to dissect them for...let's just say its seems for a late midnight snack. The story for its time is quite shocking, and director Michael Curtiz(of Casablanca fame) has obvious talent creating ominous moods, dark, barely-lit streets, and hands coming out of the darkness. Lionel Atwill, the oily/suave-British-character actor stalwart, plays Doctor X, a man who tries to find the moon killer from his scientific institution rather than have the police bring the school's name in the mud. Doctor X is himself a suspect and the cast of doctors along with John Wray and Preston Foster is an eccentric bunch indeed. Atwill and his scientific cronies give solid performances as does Fay Wray as Atwill's daughter and the love interest of reporter Lee Tracy. Tracy; however, tries to give more of a comedic turn as the stereotypical wise-cracking, joke-buzzer-in-hand reporter out to get a story no matter what. He really got on my nerves with his portrayal and obvious shortcomings as a thespian. But the film zips by and has a whole lot of punch for its day.", "From that idiot reporter to the scheme they tried to catch the murderer, this is so off the wall that it utterly fails. I know it was made in 1932, but there were lots of very good movies made that year. I always enjoy Lionel Atwill, but to see him as some sort of hero after all the trouble he's caused is ludicrous. And those scientists he surrounds himself with are equally silly. Of course, we have the romance. There's the pretty young daughter who must not have much of a social life, hanging around with all those ghouls, who falls for a guy who has no redeeming qualities. He represents that anything-for-a-story mentality that pervades so many movies of that era. I was surprised how attractive the film was. That must have been somewhat enticing to early movie goers, but, it's not enough. Don't bother. Oh, all those guys handcuffed to their chairs. If that isn't as bad as it gets, I don't know what is.", "Oof. Not a good one, even for the camp value. The premise is interesting enough: a \"Moon Killer\" is on the loose, murdering and surgically cutting off portions of his victims. This leads police to Dr. Xavier and his assistants, all of whom become suspects, and the laboratories these men use have all the requisite special effects circa 1932. The biggest problem with the film is Lee Tracy, who plays a snooping newspaper reporter who clowns around, makes lame jokes, and repeatedly uses an asinine hand buzzer. The film is quite tedious to sit through, and several scenes seem elongated or 'filler' even for a total run time of 77 minutes. Another issue is that despite the use of darkness, shadows, and ominous faces, there really is no tension. The film is predictable and character motivations are absurd, so that even if you suspend disbelief and accept Dr. Xavier's theory about detecting the killer through an elaborate experiment measuring anatomical reaction, you still end up thinking, man, this is so stupid. At least I did anyway. I'm surprised others find it 'creepy' - even the slathering on of \"synthetic flesh\" does not produce a reaction of horror, as other great films in this genre will. Silly and annoying right up to that last scene at the end.", "The 1930's was one of the most interesting transitional periods for the horror genre; it marked the heyday of the classic Gothic horror film, and the seeds of elements from the contemporary noir thrillers and 'Old Dark house' comedies which would later evolve into the 'Gruesome True Crime' films, and much later; the Slasher flick. 'Doctor X' is a great embodiment of all those different eras in one neat package.Like a noir film, the film takes place mostly at night with many expressionistic camera angles and reliance on shadows to create ambiance, like a crime thriller/whodunit, the film has police, reporters and multiple suspects, like an Old Dark House film, there's creepy but comical servants and well, an old dark house, and like various Gothic horror films, there's a mad scientist villain who may as well be a magician. Half the fun, however, is figuring out who the villain is.The plot is somewhat convoluted, but told in a linear enough fashion. A series of grisly killings that take place in the full moon(which may or, may not involve cannibalism) which the police determine could have only been committed using a certain kind of scalpel found exclusively at a currently closed university run by Doctor Xavier(Lionel Atwill); it seems all the doctors are likely suspects, but at the same time each has a plausible alibi, Xavier is given 48 hours to determine which of his faculty is the killer. Meanwhile, a wisecracking reporter(Lee Tracy)is hot on the trail not only of the killer, but of Xavier's daughter(Fay Wray, a year away from the role that would make her famous in 'King Kong'). Hilarity, or what we're supposed to see as hilarity, ensues, along with some good natured scares.The film has several odd elements worth mentioning, not the least of which is that it was one of the rare films of this era shot in color. For one, as often as Tracy's reporter character is criticized for being annoying(And a gag involving a hand-buzzer wears thin REALLY fast), he does not slow down the narrative as much as you would think. For some odd reason, characters like him who are often the sidekick of the main hero really do annoy me, but I had no problem with him here, because he IS the hero, not a sidekick. You'd expect that giving such a character such prominent screen time would make him more annoying, but it doesn't. Thankfully, there is no straight man for his antics to draw attention from, so his antics seem natural. Plus, it works as a character trait when you think about it, he's selfish and annoying and only thinks he's funny, but that's one of his flaws. And best of all, he actually does get to show some depth and dignity by being THE man who defeats the villain at the end. It may not be three-dimensional character development, but it's something you didn't see everyday in such comedy-relief characters.What's also interesting are some of the 'jump' scenes. Several years before Val Lewton perfected the 'bus' sequences in his films, 'Doctor X' throws in several; from a genuinely chilling scene where the Moon Killer zeroes in on our hero, to a scene where one of the suspected doctors is introduced in silhouette, his pointed beard and disheveled, pointing hair spikes making him look like the devil. Great stuff. It's also interesting how the title could refer to either Xavier(Who IS a suspect just as much as the others), or as a metaphorical term for the search, after all, if one of the doctors has to be the killer, than the search is for 'Doctor X'. Clever.So other than some plot holes, flat gags, the usual contrived love story, and a never explained motive for why the killer is compelled by the full moon, the film is a ton of fun to watch. And even just the HINT that the killer may or may not be a cannibal must have made this too gruesome for words back in the '30's. The color is also a nice plus.Don't miss it. Just be sure to apply a lot of 'Sssssssynthet-tic Flessshhhh' before watching it(A scene which was a real creeper then, and still is today).Y'know what's funny? The more I re-evaluate the '30's horror classics I loved as a kid, the more I realize that, aside from the Whale films and the Lugosi/Karloff trilogy, the majority of the best films of the era were not from Universal. Bizarre.~", "A Full Moon Killer has been stalking the streets of New York and now has claimed a scrub woman as his latest victim. The police suspect the Academy of Surgical Research as the home of its killer, who the police believe has a vast knowledge of the human body and where the surgical knives found at the scene came from. Dr. Xavier (head of the Academy) believes this is nonsense, but decides to perform an experiment with the four main suspects (not including Xavier) doctors Wells, Rowitz, Haines, and Duke, to test their reactions to the mention of the crimes as well as reenactments. Xavier's daughter Joan teams up with annoying reporter Lee Taylor to find clues to the murders, but they have to act quickly when one of the doctors is killed and the next victim will be Joan, and no one in the academy will be able to stop him. Very entertaining horror film that did benefit from the two strip Technicolor process. Atwill, Wray, Foster, and Rosener gave very good performances, which however did seem to be overshadowed by all technical aspects of the film, Curtiz' direction, Rennahan's cinematography, and Westmore's makeup for the killer at the film's end. The obvious drawback to the film was the perennially annoying Lee Tracy as the reporter. Oh well, you can't have everything. Rating, 8.", "This is old-fashioned fun.Lionel Atwill is Dr. Xavier who runs the experimental \"Academy for Surgical Research\" on a cliff top on the Long Island shore. His three colleagues, each a physically impaired, troglodytic drone, are hard at work on their searches for new discoveries. The three weirdos include a one-eyed man, a cripple, and Preston Foster, who has only one hand. Atwill's daughter runs around breathlessly, as only Fay Wray can be breathless. A spooky servant named Otto lurches around in the background. Lee Tracy is one of those scurrying reporters from \"The Front Page.\" The Madam in the cat house is played by the ever popular Mae Busch.A couple of murdered bodies show up and are taken to the Academy for examination. Atwill concludes that they were subject to cannibalistic gnawing after being strangled. The police determine that all signs point to the murderer's being a member of the Academy. Only Foster is exempt from suspicion because the killer used two hands. (\"Note the deep depressions on the sternocleidomastoid.\") Fortunately, Atwill has a device -- I forget what he calls this sublimely typical piece of 1930s-movies electronic junk -- that will uncover the identity of the murderer by reenacting the last murder, the killing of a young woman, using his daughter as the victim. At a critical moment during the demonstration the lights go out. There is a shriek, a scuffle, furniture tumbles over, and when the lights come back on nobody has been exposed, not even Fay Wray.With the cops pressing him, Atwill goes through the routine a second time but the protocol has been changed. Otto will lock the laboratory door from the outside, so no one can get in. Atwill himself will participate in the experiment. He and the two other suspects will be handcuffed to their bolted chairs. Only Preston Foster will be loose to manage things.Medical ethics prevent any further plot revelations except maybe for one hint. Letting Foster and Fay Wray be the only two people not handcuffed to their chairs? That was a big mistake.It's short, recklessly headlong in its pace. Director Michael Curtiz was never known for slow slogs through metaphysical swamps. The two-strip technicolor images are not bad for their time. You have your choice of tints -- ghoul green or cadaver mauve. The set borrows heavily from German expressionism. There's hardly a right angle in the joint, so to speak. And you must admire the way every wall looks shabby, dirty, like that of a tenement kitchen.Your final paragraph, Buckie, is here. I recommend the movie. I mean, what the hell. We've all spent less pleasant hours than we'd spend watching this. Why, I remember once, the dentist asking me to \"Turn this way a little.\" What an hour THAT was.", "That two-tone coloring process lends the film a weird, even otherly world, complexion. However, a number of compensations can't make up for an erratic script, containing some good ideas, but unfortunately developed in muddled fashion. Too many scenes don't follow effectively on one another ( e.g. the focus shifts often and abruptly onto peripheral characters). Nor can certain compensations make up for Lee Tracy's inept comedy relief, which comes across more like silly distraction. I agree that the culprit was too easy to spot, removing a key element of plot suspense. On the other hand, some set-ups are genuinely creepy\u2014sinister shadows, sudden close-ups, the Jekyll-Hyde transformation\u2014likely director Curtiz's creative touches.Maybe I shouldn't say it, but the normally sinister Lionel Atwill looks almost aristocratically handsome, playing the head of the clinic in uncharacteristically straight fashion. Still, I expected a maniacal cackle at some point. And, of course, the gruesome proceedings have to have a pretty girl to ease up on the eyes. Frankly, I liked the beach scene, where the luscious Wray bares the sort of curves that sent the big gorilla into a spin a year later. All in all, the premise of a faculty full of eccentrics one of whom is a killer may be a promising one. Nonetheless, in my little book, the script should have been sent back to re-write.", "A serial killer is stalking New York . At the time of the full moon he strikes and the victims bodies show signs of cannibalism . Newspaper reporter Lee Taylor in needing of a big scoop to keep his job tries to track down the killer and suspicions fall upon a group of doctorsHungarian born Michael Curtiz could possibly be the greatest film director of the 20th Century . If you look through his resume on this website you'll see a long list of films that are legends from the golden era of Hollywood . He didn't confine himself to one genre but what ever type of film he made he could often weave cinematic magic . This early Hollywood contribution from Curtiz however isn't as good as it could have beenDOCTOR X is an infuriating combination of good and bad . Based upon a stage play Curtiz manages to hide its origins and keeps the story pacing along nicely . He also manages to bring some very impressive directorial flourishes such a the introduction of Doctor Haines seen as a somewhat satanic silhouette against a wall . The problem with much of the visuals however is that its shot in early colour stock which is rather distracting . One can't help thinking black and white would have been much more suited to the movie and would have made for a better and much more atmospheric movieThe fundamental problem with DOCTOR X is a very inconsistent tone with comedy elements that clash painfully with the darker themes . The killer is a cannibal and this shocking element is emphasised at every opportunity . Of course even in a pre-code era mutilated and half eaten bodies dripping blood couldn't be shown but this is explicitly alluded to through the dialogue of Dr Xavier . Strange then that Lee Taylor is written and played by Lee Tracy as a comedic character . Comedy is a subjective thing , one person's comedic genius is another person's irritating clown but it's amazing anyone thought Taylor/Tracy could be amusing in anyway and every time he appears on screen the audience are taken out of the film . Perhaps James Whale would have been a better choice of director ?As it stands DOCTOR X is a strange combination of good and band from an outstanding and superlative director . When the film works it works very well and I had no idea who the villain was going to be . Alas the elements that don't work sometimes threaten to sabotage the rest of the film and it would take another four or five years before Curtiz really hit his stride", "DOCTOR X (First National, 1932), directed by Michael Curtiz, capitalizes on the current horror trend made popular by Universal's 1931 releases of Dracula and FRANKENSTEIN. What makes DOCTOR X stand apart with similar products distributed by other studios was its two-strip Technicolor process, considering how color was a rarity and quite costly for its time. Equally rare was the use of color for one categorized as a horror film instead of a musical. While the title DOCTOR X indicates a \"mad doctor\" theme, especially with Lionel Atwill heading the cast, in true essence is a mystery-comedy with horror elements and science fiction thrown in along with Fay Wray belting out a few screams for good measure.Plot summary: Six brutal killings have taken place at night only when the moon is full. An scrub woman is the latest victim. Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy), an inquisitive reporter for New York's Daily Record, enters the scene on the waterfront where he witnesses Doctor Xavier (Lionel Atwill), escorted by O'Halloran (Willard Robertson) and Police Commissioner Stevens (Robert Warwick), entering the Mott Street Morgue to examine the body. Because the murders were committed by a maniac with powerful hands near the vicinity of Xavier's Medical Academy of Surgical Research, all evidence points to Xavier's staff. Hoping to clear his academy of a scandal, Xavier asks Stevens for 48 hours to conduct his own investigation. With Taylor constantly snooping around Long Island's Blackstone Shoals estate where the investigations are to take place, Xavier has his beautiful daughter, Joanne (Fay Wray) attract his attention while having his medical staff handcuffed on chairs bound to the floor while staging a re-enactment of the crimes in hope that the mechanism they are connected to (an early indication of a lie detector) will reveal the killer through his heart beat reactions. It is soon discovered there is a killer among them when one of the members participating in the reenactment was murdered during a sudden blackout.In the supporting cast are Preston Foster (Professor Ben Welles, a one-armed medical student); John Wray (Doctor Haines); Arthur Edmund Carewe (Doctor Rowitz); Harry Beresford (the wheelchair bound Professor Duke); Leila Bennett (Mamie, the frightful maid); George Rosener (Otto, the mysterious butler); Mae Busch (appearing briefly as a boarding house Madame); and Thomas E. Jackson (The Newspaper Editor).The weakness of DOCTOR X is often accredited to the silly antics provided by Lee Tracy, typically cast as a wisecracking reporter who uses a buzzer placed onto his palm to shock an unsuspecting victims as Mike the Cop (Harry Holman) and Xavier's daughter (Wray) by placing the buzzard onto her bottom; along with he hiding in a slab of the morgue with a name tag placed on his toe, followed by him roaming the laboratory surrounded with dangling skeletons. The strong point of the story, however, is the way the mystery and suspense is handled, from hideous figure lurking about in a dark cloak with hands with long finger nails seen slowly clutching the throat of intended victims to a mysterious eye peeking through the hole on the door; climaxed by the killer's horrific transformation through the use of \"synthetic flesh,\" one of the greatest, yet gruesome moments captured on film, even more effective in color.During the days of commercial television, DOCTOR X aired in black and white. A perennial favorite on New York City's \"Chiller Theater\" on WPIX, Channel 11, from the 1960s to 1977, it would be another decade before DOCTOR X turned up on the airwaves again, this time with early Technicolor prints acquired from UCLA Film Archives, on cable TV's Turner Network Television (1988-1993), Turner Classic Movies (1994-present), and further availability on video cassette in the 1990s and then DVD. In one of the briefings by TCM's host, Bob Osborne, he mentioned that Technicolor prints of DOCTOR X were few, having circulated in big cities like New York and Chicago, while black and white prints played at smaller theaters in other areas. Fortunately, DOCTOR X has survived in Technicolor, make this a worth while event, thanks to interesting make-up effects by the Max Factor Corporation, lavish sets by Anton Grot, a chance seeing classic film actors usually not associated in Technicolor, notably Fay Wray and her reddish brown hair.With the obvious success by 1932 standards of DOCTOR X, Atwill and Wray would work together again in more of the same with 1933 releases of THE VAMPIRE BAT (Majestic) and MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (Warner Brothers). Seven years later, Warners turned out a sequel in name only titled THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X (Warners, 1939). Instead of bringing back Tracy, Wray and Atwill, the new leads were enacted by Wayne Morris as the comical reporter, Rosemary Lane the heroine, and Humphrey Bogart (!) as a zombie, formerly Doctor Maurice Xavier brought back to life not through the use of synthetic flesh, but by synthetic blood. A missed opportunity for Lionel Atwill, the one and only Doctor X, or was it? (***)"], "tt0022913": ["Don't let people convince you that \"Freaks\" is a horror movie, because it isn't. It's actually a quite sad and sympathetic look at the way abnormalities were treated in the early part of the 20th century, and has direct parallels to the obsession with physical perfection causing eating disorders today. Tod Browning of course asks us to consider who are the bigger freaks: those with deformed bodies or those with deformed souls? The two \"normal\" people who are out to cheat and steal are monstrous, whereas the freaks are quite likable and charming. The ending is disturbing to be sure, but it's hard to condemn the freaks for acts that seem largely justified.Is it a coincidence that in several shots showing Cleopatra reclining on a sofa, she appears to be deformed herself (in one shot it looks as if she has no legs). Has anybody else noticed this? \"Freaks\" was obviously way ahead of its time. There's a very interesting documentary on the DVD about its reception in 1932; it bombed and pretty much ruined Browning's career. Thank God that the general public is not allowed to be the final arbiter of a film's value. Think how many priceless films we would have lost by now if that were the case.Grade: A", "A forest glade somewhere in Europe. A warm, sunny day with children playing on the grass. But the camera moves closer and reveals that something is terribly wrong. For these are not children, but tragically misshapen human beings. Pinheads. Dwarfs. A young man with only half a body. A man without arms or legs. These are the Freaks.In 1932, director Tod Browning, fresh from his success with DRACULA, was instructed by Irving Thalberg to top FRANKENSTEIN. He succeeded. The resulting film was considered so ghastly that it was banned in Britain for 30 years. It is the strangest film MGM ever released.Browning wanted to tell a tale of love, greed & revenge set in a circus, most particularly in the sideshow of human anomalies. He scoured Europe & America for the perfect cast. He got them: Violet & Daisy Hilton, the celebrated Siamese twins; dwarf brother & sister Harry & Daisy Earles; Johnny Eck the Half Boy (a good actor, he will remain in your mind a long time); the tragic Josephine Joseph, a hermaphrodite; as well as a human skeleton, armless girls and the female pinheads, among others.While the plot is exploitive & the title tasteless, these people show us glimpses of their hearts, some of the agony of their condition and make us wonder, `What if I'd been born as one of them?'The rest of the cast is made up of MGM stock players Leila Hyams, Wallace Ford, Edward Brophy, Olga Baclanova and the screen's champion stutterer Roscoe Ates.The plot is simple. A beautiful trapeze artist marries a dwarf for his money, then plots his murder with her lover, the circus strong man. The subsequent action is both horrifying & strangely satisfying. Various scenes - the Freaks' Banquet, the chase through the storm - are among the most bizarre ever filmed. You won't soon forget the time you spend with the FREAKS.", "`Freaks' is a totally unique and superb film by Tod Browning. He made himself legendary one year before this came out \u0096 in 1931 \u0096 with the all-time horror classic `Dracula'. This film, however, is something completely different and it nearly cost Browning his career. Since Browning had the courage to cast actual deformed actors, the words \u0091distasteful' and \u0091exploitative' were automatically attached to his masterpiece and it remained banned in many countries for too many years. Very unjustified, of course because throughout the whole film, you NEVER feel like a voyeur and neither is the misery of these unfortunate people overly exposed. On the contrary, I'd say\u0085you can't but get deeply affected by these circus freaks. Especially in the 30's, when the people didn't know much about physical anomalies and feared the unknown, I dare to say Tod Browning's `Freaks' could have been an essential social portrait. And keep in mind that Browning's main moral is that the `freaks' show a lot more solidarity and honesty than the `normal' people whose every motivation is driven by greed and power.The plot of this purely gold film is set in a traveling circus in which the freaks and normally formed people work together. The beautiful trapeze artist and her strongman lover plot a cowardly plan and she uses her beauty to seduce the rich midget named Hans (a brilliant Harry Earless who also starred in Browning's `The Unholy Tree'). When the greedy couple openly insults the group spirit of the freaks and publicly humiliates Hans, an eerie act of vengeance is thought up. This film is over 70 years old and it'll still unquestionably shock and amaze you. To me, it's just perfect. An outstanding mixture of warm-hearted characters, great dialogue and tension. The climax, in which the freaks seal the portentous fate of their enemies, is an immortal piece of pure terror! `Freaks' is one of the most dazzling classics ever made and must be seen by anybody who ever showed any interest in cinema.", "I really dig 1930s horror movies. There's just something special about them that can never be recreated. A lot of it has to do with the talkies being new territory, many of the directors adapting German Expressionist techniques to Hollywood melodrama, and the freedom allowed before the Hayes Code really kicked in.  Movies like 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride Of Frankenstein', 'Island Of Lost Souls', 'The Invisible Man' and 'White Zombie' are horror classics which still impress today. I wonder whether anyone will be watching the lame horror movies of today in seventy years for any other reason than some cheap laughs? Todd Browning made the transition from silent movies and directed the hugely successful 'Dracula' in 1931. It was a sensation and made Bela Lugosi a horror icon. Browning could pretty much do anything he chose after that. He chose to do 'Freaks'. Great for us as, not so great for him. The movie was universally reviled and even banned in some countries and his career never fully recovered. But 'Freaks' is an extraordinary movie with a lot of heart.  It has faults, sure  - some corny acting at times,  and not so great production values - but it really doesn't matter. I don't know anyone who's seen it who hasn't been deeply affected by it. The reason the movie caused such a negative reaction back in the 1930s was because it used real circus performers including Zip the Pinhead and Radian \"The Living Torso\". Many people found this to be distasteful and exploitative, but the performers seemed to be glad to get the opportunity to work, and the whole crux of the movie is that the \"freaks\" are more decent than the \"normal\" Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) , the trapeze artist who marries little person Hans (Harry Earls) for his money. 'Freaks' is still a very powerful and unique movie. It has inspired many creative people over the years from the Surrealists to The Ramones to Jodorowsky to David Lynch. 'Freaks' comes with my highest recommendation!", "It's interesting to me that this film is viewed as offensive. People say that these people are being made fun of and exploited. I wouldn't like to comment on how they were treat on set or anything but I will say that they all see to enjoying them selfs for the most part and as for being made fun of, I think the total opposite is happening.This movie came out in 1932 so before I watched it I also was nervous that these people would be used to make others laugh at their expense but it was the furthest thing from the truth. This film hands its subject matter with such care and deft that I was astounded that it came out in 1932.It can be like looking at window into the past as sometimes it almost plays like a documentary due to the fact that most of these actors were actually circus performers. There are so many scenes where the performers are just relaxing and chatting to each other. It shows people they are just like us, it doesn't mater if they look different. It shows them doing mundane things like hanging washing, struggling with problems like infidelity. It shows ignorant people that they are human just like you.I think the title \"Freaks\" is interesting. I think there is two ways to look at it. The first way is the obvious and offensive way demeaning the performers but I think by the end of the film the only freaks in this movie are the people who look normal. The movie shows this makeshift family coming together for each other, the only people who are outcasts are the able bodied \"normal people\". I think that is one way to interpret it any way or maybe I am reading into it.That is the interesting thing about this movie. You can read a lot into it and it is never clear what the director was really trying to say as another interesting part is all of the performers are shown to be good people, kind people for the most part friendly and loving. Once again the only truly evil people in this movie are the people who are able bodied people. The reason I lean to the side of the director was showing these people are simply just people is it is framed as shocking and wrong when bad things happen to the performers and I don't think it is ever played for laughs.It also really bothers me that this movie is labelled a horror movie. It is a drama. There isn't really any horror elements to be found.One more thing I just want to point out is that I am astounded how much Ryan Murphy took from this movie for season 4 of American Horror Story. Like I think his only reference point for \"freak shows\" was this movie. Just a stray observation.So I would say definitely watch this movie. It is only short as it was cut down due to the fact people believed it was too outrageous and offensive. It has a lot of heart and is really head of it's time.", "Part fictional portrait of a group of circus sideshow performers and part tragic soap opera about their various and complicated relationships, the main story has a midget, Hans (Harry Earles), falling in love with the Amazonian trapeze artist, Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova), who feigns affection for him--at first to taunt him and later to use him.Freaks isn't really a horror film, although the horror boom that began in 1931 precipitated Freaks entering production. The script developed out of an earlier one named \"Spurs\" that had been in MGM's possession since the late 1920s. The success of Universal's horror films of 1931 (Dracula and Frankenstein) had studios scrambling to cash in on the trend. Horror films weren't new, of course, but repeated commercial success of horror films released in quick succession was. A number of factors contributed to the phenomenon, including the Great Depression, the lingering cultural impact from World War I, and the advent of sound films. So even though Freaks wasn't exactly horror, and the protagonists weren't exactly monsters, it was close enough. In the early 1930s, the public had not yet been overexposed to media-sensationalized differences in human appearances and behavior. The effect of the film then, in conjunction with memories of real life horrors, including those of war-mangled veterans, offered the emotional reaction that producers and studios are often seeking from horror films.But Freaks is really part tragic drama, part character study, and in many ways it is almost a documentary. The modern attraction to the film comes from a few sources. One, the \"gawking effect\", or the simple fact of watching the freaks in action. Sideshows are an unfortunately dying phenomenon, if they're not already dead (many would say they are), largely because of a combination of medical advances, which often \"cure\" the physical differences that would have made \"victims\" sideshow candidates, and political correctness, which mistakenly sees sideshows as negatively exploitative. It's fascinating watching the different kinds of people in the film and their behavior, including not only their social interactions, but how some of them manage to just get around and perform everyday activities such as eating, lighting a cigarette, and so on. This kind of material takes up at least half of the film's short running time (64 minutes; initially it ran closer to 90 minutes, but 26 minutes of cuts were made (and are now apparently lost) to appease the New York State censor board).Two, this was a lost film, figuratively and almost literally, for quite some time. MGM wanted nothing to do with it. For a while, it had been playing the \"roadshow\" circuit in different cuts, under different titles, such as \"Nature's Mistakes\". The film had been banned in many areas, and at least technically is still banned in some. It eventually appeared on VHS in the 1980s, but until the recent DVD release, it has never been very easy to find in most rental or retail outlets.Three, the most common modern reading of the film--and this was also part of director Tod Browning's intention in making Freaks, even if the average audience member didn't see it this way at first, has it as a Nightbreed (1990)-like turning of the dramatic tables, where the extremely alienated \"monsters\" are the sympathetic protagonists and the ostensibly \"normal\" humans turn out to be the real monsters. For those who like films best where they can identify in some emotional way with the characters, Freaks is particularly attractive to anyone who feels alienated or strongly different, even looked down upon, by \"normal\" society. At various times, and by various people, Freaks has been read as everything from purely exploitative schlock to a socialist parable to a film imbued with odd commentary, metaphors and subtexts about male-female couplings and Oedipal complexes.Freaks isn't a great film in terms of the usual criteria, such as storytelling, exquisite performances, and so on, but it's appropriate that it wouldn't be a masterpiece per the normal criteria--it's not about normal people. The film is certainly valuable as a creative, almost experimental artwork, not to mention as a more or less permanent record of the decayed and almost abandoned artform of sideshows. It's not surprising that not every cast member is an incredible actor--for many roles, there was only one person available who could have fulfilled the character in a particular way, making the stilted delivery of dialogue more excusable. In any event, this is an important film historically, and a joy to watch.", "If there ever was a time when film making could get away with producing movies that bordered on blatantly exploitative, the pre-Code 1930s were it. Tod Browning, director of Dracula, went one definitive step further and effectively killed his own career when he took the reigns of directing FREAKS, a project that was turned down by Myrna Loy when offered the lead since she deemed it to be too offensive as it was.She may have been right, but nowadays, FREAKS stands as one of the shortest yet most effective horror movies of all time due to its chilling climactic sequence. The plot's plausibility can be in itself questioned -- where can a circus performer who's a midget have all the money he is said to have in the film is anyone's guess -- but since this is a horror story, and an excellent one, suspension of disbelief allows one to sort of accept what's being explained to us.Hans (Harry Earles), the little performer at the center of this story, rejects equally little person Frieda (Daisy Earles), loves Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova), a platinum blonde trapeze artist, herself involved with strongman Hercules (Henry Victor). Eventually, through a series of events, Cleopatra marries Hans for money, but she goes out of her way to humiliate him at the wedding reception, horrified as the other circus \"freaks\" chant \"Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble, we will make you one of us.\" Oh, how dead-serious they are in their eerie chant.When the band of freaks find out she has been poisoning Hans to get his money and that her strongman lover has raped Venus (Leila Hyams), another performer who's always been good to them, they exact a horrific revenge against the both of them, and the last 10 minutes of FREAKS are as gruesome as terrifying.This film was initially received with so much repulsion from audiences that MGM virtually disowned the film. Only until much later has it been re-discovered as a horror classic, and again, while some of the plot elements don't hold water today, the basic story of the abused and disabled taking charge of their own lives and punishing their abusers stands on its own today. That actual disabled people were used as actors only makes it more daring and adds to both the creepiness of the movie's feel and enhances their final moment on screen and only enhances the final ironic reel.", "In the first place, this movie was originally made to compete with the Universal Horror films, as though these human beings who are the titular \"freaks\" are not human. Director Tod Browning was still reeling from the loss of his big star, Lon Chaney, to cancer, and thought this would be a good follow up to his previous horror films without Chaney. And after all, he had just finished directing Dracula.Actually, it paints a very sympathetic picture of the disabled and deformed circus performers, who, at this time of limited medical knowledge and abounding prejudice, were very limited in what they could do in life. They have a very deep camaraderie that is shown through such events as the birth of a child to the bearded lady and the engagement of one of the conjoined twins. Since the other twin is already married, there is much arguing over what the logistics are going to be in these two marriages.The actual \"monsters\" in this film are the acrobat \"Cleopatra\" (Olga Baclanova), and strong man Hercules (Henry Victor), who are having an affair. Two physical specimens with monstrous morality. When the dwarf Hans is captivated by Cleopatra's beauty, she at first teases him by leading him on. But then he starts giving her expensive jewelry and she decides to keep up the ruse. When Freida, Hans' dwarf girlfriend, comes to Cleopatra and asks her to stop teasing him, she accidentally tips off Cleo to the fact that Hans has inherited a great fortune. Hercules and Cleo then plan to get Hans to marry Cleo and then poison him so she can inherit his money. But the two don't realize the close strong bond that the circus performers have with one another and that they are literally each others eyes and ears. Complications ensue.The film was originally set to run at 90 minutes, but test audiences were so revolted that 30 minutes were cut out so that the remaining film only runs at an hour. Then a scene was tacked on at the end to show Hans' grief over what has ultimately happened. MGM would often add an end scene that really didn't fit the mood of the rest the film during Irving Thalberg's reign there to wrap things up.This film pretty much finished the career of director Browning as afterwards he only directed a farcical sound remake of a silent film he had made at MGM and one other film and then retired. This was a good late role for Olga Baclanova. She had a very thick Russian accent and had some great late silent roles at Paramount, but talking film had not been kind to her career. This really gave her one last great role where her accent really fit into the plot, plus this was not a film where lots of dialogue was called for, and she was very good at using gestures and expressions to convey emotion.In the 1960s this film got a fresh look, and today is widely celebrated as having been ahead of its time. The horror is implied and left up to your imagination as to just HOW it happened, and the empathy shown the circus performers is profound. It even got a separate DVD release with commentary.", "\"Freaks\" is one of the most controversial horror films from the 30's,mainly because director Tod Browning hired as the actors real sideshow freaks.It does have a rather unsettling effect,but I think that really does work for the film.Browning builds up a great amount of suspense with the good use of locations,story and lots of atmosphere.The ending,where we see freaks crawling in the mud,is pretty creepy.Anyway check this one out-it's worth watching.", "Freaks is many things, but boring is not one of them. Tod Browning's film happens to have a certain power to it in that it's actually kind of conventional with its story- a man falls in love with a woman, who wants him (not immediately but soon after finding out) for his money, and when his friends find out they plot revenge against the dastardly woman. It almost reminded me of a fable in a way, like some kind of cautionary tale. But it's definitely not simplistic in the way of what you might expect from 1932 (i.e. 'watch out for these deformed, crazy people who may kill you in the dead of night, etc'). It's the other way around, where the woman, Cleo, and her real lover Hercules, are the 'freaks' of the film, as they lack the real friendship, compassion, understanding and reality of their situation like the other sideshow attractions do. It's Hans who ends up getting duped, but then getting a happy ending, and rightfully so with maybe the most \"normal\" of the bunch, his should-be wife, who also happens to be a dwarf.So in terms of being a 'message' movie, it's actually quite good by sticking very firmly to its one-dimensional guns. It doesn't fool its audience exactly by being something else that it isn't, and Browning's background in silent and horror films is shown in some very memorable scenes. Chiefly of these are the wedding banquet with the milestone of cheerily creepy cinematic moments with the 'ooble-gobble' chant where everything becomes clear. There are also some really horrifying images in the climax when the 'freaks' finally get their payback against Cleo. Now, because of such drama being put alongside such a demented atmosphere, the film lacks a lot of things other conventional films even have. The story, even at only over an hour, takes some time to really get started after some getting-to-know scenes with the bulk of the ensemble. And there are a couple of holes that pop up as well; the end moment where Cleo is revealed in the sideshow, literally having become 'one of them', it's too ridiculous and silly to even think of how it happened.But somehow Browning's film doesn't feel too aged- it's actually one of those superbly shot early talkies, where the images still speak well enough on their own, while the dialog from these (mostly) non-professionals adds more of the emotional impact in the scenes. Once the audience can come to accept what these people are born with or have become (and in this day and age where day time talk show outranks most of what is seen in the film it's not hard to do) it's hard not to dismiss its worth. But if you turn it off after starting to see some of these strange oddities of human nature, you'll be missing the point. This is one hell of a picture that should stand the test of time.", "Cleopatra is a gold digging trapeze artist who seduces sideshow midget Hans for his large inheritance. Fellow midget Frieda is suspicious and jealous of Cleopatra. Sweet Venus breaks up with brutish Strongman Hercules and he starts an affair with Cleopatra. Venus falls for the nice clown Phroso. Hans is completely under Cleopatra's spell and eventually marries her.This is most notable for the real circus freaks in the movie. It even uses real Siamese twins Violet and Daisy Hilton when it probably doesn't have to. I guess it was horrific at the time but it's more of an oddity today. The acting skills of the freaks vary greatly. Some of them have trouble speaking in a normal voice. Hans' voice is quite squeaky. The story is scattered with some side stories touching on the various freaks showcasing their individual skills. The main story works well as a drama. This isn't really a horror at all.", "This highly controversial film must have gotten some people pretty upset. Todd Browning, who directed horror films, wanted his audience to check their attitudes toward those who have been born with deformities or some disability. What we have here are people. Pure and simple. Despite their appearances, these are people with golden hearts who support each other on a day to day basis. They love and work and do all the things we all do. There are some villainous types here, but they tend to be the \"normal\" folks. I stayed away from this movie for a long time because I thought it would be uncomfortable. After a little discomfort from first viewing some of the more dramatic aberrations, I began to enjoy their personalities and their character. Browning took a real chance and succeeded.", "I caught the Hilton Sisters in 1951's \"Chained For Life\" a couple weeks ago, and while researching that film, I was pointed in the direction of Tod Browning's \"Freaks\". I had heard of it before of course, but hadn't realized that the picture dated back to the early 1930's. MGM's Irving Thalberg wished to capitalize on the popularity of horror films of the era, one of which was Browning's year earlier take on the all time classic \"Dracula\". The studio already owned the rights to the short story \"Spurs\" by Tod Robbins on which this movie was based, and had the active interest of Lon Chaney Sr. in bringing the story to film before he died in 1930.It goes beyond saying that this is a picture that won't appeal to everyone, but at the same time I don't think you have to suffer from voyeuristic tendencies to find it gripping. Unless you grew up in the Depression era (and that leaves most of the current population out), you wouldn't ever have seen such a large collection of human anomalies on display in one place at one time. My own experience of growing up in the 1950's allowed me to sample a mere shadow of these holdovers from a prior era at the local county fair, but sadly, they were of the half man/half woman and 'man eating chicken' variety - not 'true freaks' in the sense of the word that the title offers here.Needless to say, the movie became a lightning rod for Hollywood backlash groups when it first came out, who also targeted the sudden popularity of gangster films. Although the picture did well in major cities like New York, MGM didn't want to take it on the financial chin with wide release, and pulled it from their calendar. The picture was actually banned for almost three decades until the counter-culture of the 1960's revived the picture in this country. After all, if you considered yourself a hippie-freak and found all things 'freaky' to your liking, it was inevitable that a picture with the same title would find a new audience.Too many other reviewers on this board have retold the picture's main plot, so instead I'll offer my impressions of the characters. I think I found Johnny Eck the Half Boy to be the most interesting. I couldn't get over how easily he scrambled from place to place, maneuvering stairs and obstacles as easily as you or I can walk on flat ground. I found Prince Randian, the Human Torso to be truly disturbing. I know, I know, I'm trying to be as objective as possible about this, and maybe that's one of the confounding things about being 'normal'. Who's to say that any one of us has the authority to proclaim what's normal?You know, I've seen a wide variety of films in all genres, but I don't think any single one ends as creepily grotesque as the final attack on Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) in one of the picture's final scenes. Under the dark of night and crawling through the mud, the image of a dozen mis-shapen but determined attackers is enough to create a week's worth of nightmares. You have to remind yourself that this isn't modern day CGI or some other kind of trick photography or special effects wizard at work. I'd watch it all over again if I didn't have to get some sleep tonight.", "In a side-show circus, where the greatest attractions are malformed people, the gorgeous trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) is the lover of the strong Hercules (Henry Victor). She acts as if she liked the German midget Hans (Harry Earles), who is in love with her, to borrow his money and get expensive gifts he gives to her. When the jealous German midget Frieda (Daisy Earles), who loves Hans, asks Cleopatra to spare Hans from a great deception, she accidentally discloses that he is an heir of a great fortune. Cleo decides to get married with Hans to poison him and get his inheritance. In the wedding feast, Cleopatra openly flirts with Hercules and mocks the side-show performers. When a very ill Hans is saved by a doctor that tells that he has been cruelly poisoned, the other freaks snoops in Hans trailer and they find what Cleopatra is doing with him. In a stormy night, all the freaks join forces and transform Cleopatra in the Feathered Hen. Although not shown in the DVD, which has the commercial alternative conclusion, in the original story Hercules is castrated and becomes a soprano singer.\"Freaks\" is a magnificent movie and characters study of Tod Browning, who uses side-show performers to develop a film originally labeled as \"horror\" genre, but actually a dramatic romance with dark consequences or even a sort of documentary of this type of show with malformed people. What I liked most in this movie, besides the abilities of the \"freaks\", is the fact that two \"normal\" people with beautiful appearances are the real monsters, while most of the \"freaks\" are human beings showing great sentiment. But Tod Browning was careful and did not label all the \"normal\" people as evil, since we see Venus, Phroso and Madame Tetrallini very tender and respectful with the deformed artists. There are many persons that judge people by their clothes, or their external appearance even in the present days, and this movie is a lesson, showing that no matter how these \"freaks\" may look, they are human beings with feelings and able to have a normal productive life. In the extras of the Brazilian DVD, there are many explanations about the origin of this movie, and how MGM decided to produce due to the boom of horror movies originated with the successful \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\" and to compete with Universal. However, I would like to highlight that the original ending with Hercules castrated was replaced by a commercial conclusion, and the information that this type of show of exploitation was prohibited in the 40's. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Monstros\" (\"Monsters\")", "Banned in most countries for over three decades, this is one of the most bizarre and fascinating films Hollywood ever produced. Basically a soap-opera set in a side-show, it is a look into the lives of a group of sideshow performers in a traveling circus.In the beginning of the film, we meet Cleopatra (Baclanova), a beautiful but avaricious trapeze artist who seduces and marries midget circus owner Hans (Earles) to get at his money. At the wedding reception, the close-knit society of freaks welcomes her into the family as \"one of us, one of us.\" Cleopatra is disgusted however by this very thought and tells them she will never be grotesque, while her secret lover, Hercules the strongman, howls with laughter. She humiliates her smitten husband by openly kissing Hercules. After they find out they tried to poison Hans, the group comes up with an idea to take revenge at the beautiful trapeze artist and her strongman lover.Tod Browning (DRACULA, THE UNHOLY THREE) put his career on the line with the making of this film. MGM, trying to compete with Universal, and cash in on the new appetite for horror films in the early thirties, never knew what hit them with this film. It caused quite a stir and such an amount of negative publicity they decided to virtually disown it and until the '60s it remained practically unseen. The fact that infamous bad film maker Dwain Esper (REEFER MADNESS, MANIAC, see my earlier review), showed the film in road shows and burlesque houses, only enhanced the film's notorious cult reputation.Even today many scour away from seeing this film because of its supposed voyeurism. It might be seen as a very disturbing and ugly film, but at the same time a beautiful and ultimately a moving account of the shortcomings and prejudice of mankind. Most people didn't get it and many thought of it as a new low in Hollywood depravity and were horrified with the film. In truth it's a very warm and humane look at how physically deformed people manage on their own, and a fascinating insight in the world of side-show performers, a milieu Browning (a former \"snake man\" in the circus himself) was very familiar with. Not an outstanding film in terms of cinematic qualities, but because of the completely unique subject matter and the almost documentary like approach to the phenomenon of the side show, whilst using actual freaks, a term that didn't have the same connotation as today.In 1994 the film was selected for the National Film Registry's archive of cinematic treasures. Rightfully so, not only because it's a unique piece of cinema but historically one the very few cinematic accounts left on attitudes towards disabled persons. Even today, the reluctance by most people to even admit this film's very existence, only exemplifies how many misunderstandings about people that are not \"normal\", still exist.The recent DVD-release comes with the excellent documentary \"Freaks: Sideshow Cinema.\"Camera Obscura --- 9/10", "Those that have seen either 1930's gangster film, \"The Public Enemy\" or \"Little Caesar\" will be familiar with the opening scrawl of the amazing film, \"Freaks.\" In the 1930's it seemed as though the filmmakers had to set up the audience or apologize, in a way, for what they were about to see. The opening, before the title card, explains how \"freaks\" or human oddities have been treated by society. It tells how such deformed people were shunned from society, but, how they have normal thoughts and feelings just like the rest of us. This truly is the power of this truly moving, funny, very strange, and ultimately frightening film from the \"Dark Carnival\" mind of director Tod Browning...No reason to do a summary here, that ruins the experience for new audiences to discover on their own and the rest of the reviewers have all ready done a stellar job, I'm sure, of giving plot synopsis.Let's say that the average viewer will be stunned at first by the fact that real deformed dwarfs, midgets,siamese twins, and other \"oddities\" were the actors in this film. And that, in itself, lends the film its mysterious power and casts its spell on the viewer as much now in 2004 as I'm sure it did in the 30's and upon its rediscovery in the 1960's.The tone of this film varies throughout. At it's center really are several relationships: Hans and his fianc\u00e9e; Hans and the \"Big\" Lady, Cleopatra; Frozo the Clown and Venus; Hercules the strong man and Cleopatra, and of course the \"Freaks\" vs. Hercules and Cleopatra and the special code of the Freaks.There are several lame 1930's jokes an example: \"I thinks she likes you, b-b-b-but h-he don't!\" stutters a clown in the circus when the half male/female character walks by Hercules and stops to take a gander. It's a strange, perverse joke and an example of what you're in for with this movie.The power of the film is within the freaks themselves. We are invited to gawk, stare, but, ultimately sympathize with them. We want to see anyone who threatens them get their comeuppance and boy do they ever get that!The freak that will freak you out the most: The Living Torso, Radian.You'll love Frozo and Venus and pull for them throughout.You'll root for Hans and Frida.You'll enjoy Rosco the clown's humorous performance.You'll be truly disturbed by the classic; uber-horror scene of the freaks crawling with knives in the mud in the rain-storm revenge sequence toward the end. Some of the most classic images in all of film not just horror.I love it when Hans calls other \"big\" people in the circus who make him angry : \"Swine!\" He rules.When the title card: THE WEDDING FEAST comes up you too will be truly FREAKED out! I love this movie and it has quickly become one of my favorites of all time right along-side 1930's classics like Dracula, Frankenstein, etc.", "D-U-M-B! Everyone's accusin' me!I've been listening to The Ramones' music off and on for almost 30 years now, and despite reading and viewing tons of stuff about the band and its origins, I'd never run across how they came up with the whole \"pinhead\" theme.Well, I've finally seen FREAKS, often listed as one of the great cult flicks of all time. And wouldn't you know it, the \"pinheads\", including \"Schlitze\", the inspiration for The Ramones' mascot who always came out to join the band during their live shows at the end of the Pinhead song, were in FREAKS.The Ramones also slightly modified the \"freak chant\" from the wedding scene, changing \"Gooble-Gobble\" to \"Gabba-Gabba\". I guess Jeffrey Hyman (Joey Ramone) must have viewed himself as somewhat \"freakish\" (he did have an incredible look), and really related to the group of circus curiosities assembled for this film.After being shelved for about three decades, FREAKS started playing again at art-house theaters in the mid-60's, and that's where Joey had to have come across it.As far as my film review, this movie needs to be viewed. Look past the stilted acting, and soak up the message. It will stay with you for a long, long time.", "Welcome to FREAKS. Welcome to Tod Browning's world. It is a world populated by pinheads, dwarfs, skeletal men, hermaphrodites, limbless men, and adults trapped in children's bodies. There are no special effects here. No sleight of hand. No camera tricks. No makeup. The actors and actresses portraying the sideshow attractions in this film are all real, amassed from all over the world by an obsessed director who wanted everything to be just perfect for his film. It turned out that he was mistaken: audiences weren't ready for a film this powerful at the time of realise, and it got heavily cut in America and banned in Britain for thirty years.To put it plainly, this is quite simply one of the best horror films ever made. It's essential viewing. A film which humanises the people who were subjected to such cruel deformations, and demonises the cruel, greedy \"normal\" folk who are about as far away from humanity as can be. I loved watching this film. Watching the pinheads dance and play, the torso man light a cigarette using only his mouth, the mirth and glee which these folks manage to express despite their unfortunate conditions. They live, damn it, and they're a role model for the rest of us folks.The plot is a simple one of revenge, which carries the whole film. We know what's coming and yet it still hooks us anyways. The acting is good; although the \"normal\" actors are surpassed in every way by their real-life misshapen scene-stealers. The midgets and malformities come across so flawlessly because they are not acting, merely playing themselves. The pinheads are probably the most endearing of the lot, with their enduring friendliness, I fell in love with them. The subplot involving romance between a good-natured clown and his girlfriend is touching and tender.Everybody remembers the ending of this film, which has the freaks taking revenge on the cruel strongman and his mistress. The act of revenge is only implied, but the build-up is spectacular. The sight of hate-filled victims advancing to enact their revenge is truly unforgettable and a classic moment in horror cinema, one which has been imitated many times but never equalled. The famed \"wedding banquet\" scene is also very good, and imitated almost exactly in THE MUTATIONS. You won't even notice the fact that nothing much really happens, as you'll be so engrossed in a world so different from ours that you'll lose all touch with reality - at least, that's what happened with me. I've said enough. Go and watch this film.", "According to this movie, the real freaks of this side show are the normally developed human beings with murder in their heart, and they are to pay for their betrayal of the disfigured and maimed members of this traveling show. As I prepare to re-visit the Broadway musical \"Side Show\" on its opening preview, I went back to see this movie which featured in smaller parts the Hilton Sisters, Daisy and Violet, the Siamese twins who became well known yet lead tragic lives due to their circumstances and the lack of values and compassion of their times. The new production of \"Side Show\" re-enacts the sisters' participation in the making of the movie including the re-creation of the various characters from it, giving it a tie-in to indicate how true the story really was.This story focuses on the dwarf Hans (Harry Earles) who mistakenly believes that the glamorous Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) is in love with him. She's discovered that he has inherited a small fortune and plots with her lover Hercules (Henry Victor) to marry then murder him. When the other \"freaks\" accept Cleopatra as one of their own, she is aghast by their audacity, throwing the celebratory wine in the face of the dwarf dancing on the table in front of her. That dwarf is none other than Angelo Rossitto, who played the side-kick to Bela Lugosi in several Z-grade films of the 1940's and worked well up into the 1980's. Besides the Hilton Sisters, some other real life side show performers allowed themselves to somewhat exploited.Of course, this film really doesn't take off on the horror plane until the conclusion where revenge is bitter and the results are truly a fate worse than death. Shots of the various \"freaks\" throughout the film show them either child-like, content with their situation and basically harmless. Definitely pre-code in nature, this also features a hermaphrodite. \"She likes you\", stutter Roscoe Ates tells one admirer, adding on, \"But he don't.\" When the evil freaks get their come-uppance, the scene turns from light-hearted to stormy with shots of limbless men crawling through the mud with instruments of torture in the mouths and Cleopatra in no position to get away from them, even though she's obviously faster.What is sort of freakish about this movie is the fact that Harry Earles plays the love interest of his real-life sister, Freida. People who see their billing probably assume that in real life, they were married. If you can get past that, you might be able to accept their fictional characters being involved in spite of Cleopatra's interference because the romantic scenes between the two little people is presented very subtly. In its day, the film was considered one of the most grotesque of its time, but today, it comes just off as more disturbing because of the way supposed normal people would get enjoyment out of seeing something outside the realm of what was considered natural. If the film has provided any service, it really makes the viewer wonder what normal really is.", "It is ironic how director Tod Browning followed up \"Dracula\"--a horror film with painterly set design and a distinct atmosphere of unease--with a horror film more grounded in reality. Whereas the sets in \"Dracula\" were as skillfully rendered as the most elaborate of tapestries, the abstraction of \"Freaks\" comes from the title characters, who are at once hideous, wonderful, and all too human. Browning doesn't present these characters--who were actual sideshow performers--in an exploitative manner (though the long disclaimer that precedes the film is a definite reflection of his concern), but instead touches on a humility, modesty, and altruism that makes them as capable of expressing joy, sorrow, and vengeance as any 'normal' human being. And that's the overriding moral of \"Freaks,\" wherein busty trapeze artist Cleopatra marries sensitive midget Hans only so she and her lunkheaded, strongman lover can make off with his inheritance. Granted, this plot has since become clich\u00e9, but to apply it to sideshow performers who are truly in their element 'under the big top' is something of a masterstroke...as it makes the 'normals' seem that much more out-of-place and unwelcome. (A complaint: as some of the dialog is difficult to decipher, it seems that the sound quality was either poorly recorded at the time or when it was transferred to video.)", "\"Freaks\" is a movie I have avoided for a long time. Just the subject matter of it made me intensely uncomfortable, and I didn't want to have that feeling of being party to a crime by being a willing spectator to it, as a lot of horrible exploitation flicks have made me feel.Well, I was wrong to avoid it, it turns out. The movie was disastrous for great director Tod Browning (of the most famous version of \"Dracula\" fame). It might be one of the most widely banned movies of all time, and is indeed still technically banned in some parts of America.All the complainers missed the point. \"Freaks\", unfortunately named as it is, comes down heavily on the side of the side-show people it is believed to exploit. You never get the sense that we are supposed to gawk at them. I was not surprised to find that Browning himself was a circus performer, a contortionist who some might just as well have labelled a \"freak\". The movie puts us in their world. In fact, it feels as though we are invited to marvel at how well those differently abled are allowed to live; observe the scene where the man who is a quadruple amputee lights a cigarette, and the ease with which the \"half boy\" gets around. The \"normal\" people are the outsiders, and the bad guys, whose exploitation of the little people turns psychopathic when they realise how much money might be involved.The final, amazing end sequence, with the performers gathering in a rain storm for revenge, was unfortunately cut in the version I saw, but the final shot of what happens to the villainess is still shocking, as is much of the material, all the more so because you know what you're seeing is real. This is no CGI or animatronic fest, it's a movie from 1932.I say take the risk and check it out. There's no other experience like it in the movies. It was, and continues to be, completely misunderstood.", "A beautiful trapeze artist agrees to marry a midget in the circus after she discovers he's going to inherit a fortune. Then, after the wedding feast, she begins to poison him. The other \"freaks\" find this out, chase her through a forest, and turn her into a avian freak herself, only able to cluck like a chicken.This will raise your hackles because Todd Browning has cast genuine physical anomalies in major parts, including midgets, dwarfs, Siamese twins, microcephalics, and several limbless people -- all demonstrating their freak show skills. The armless lady eats with her toes. The human worm manages to roll and light a cigarette with nothing but his teeth.Our fascination with anomalies probably has a physical basis. I don't want to get into it, but anesthetized chimps arouse horror in their companions. And I've brought home from the vet's office a cat who was still groggy from her total anesthetic and was surprised to find that her litter mates stared wide-eyed at her. One hissed and struck at her. Something is up that we don't know anything about. I wonder if that combination of fear and hostility is in any way related to human attitudes towards those of a different color or set of religious beliefs.Enough of that. Nobody would claim that this movie is expertly performed. The major characters, for the most part, are successfully drawn, but Olga Baclanova overacts outrageously, and many of the freaks can hardly act at all. (Why should they?) In some scenes, they glance at the camera out of the corners of their eyes.The film raises questions of sociology. What, exactly, is solidarity? How is it demonstrated and what effect does it have? We know some of the answers. Group loyalty -- not democracy or Mom's apple pie -- is what keeps soldiers from throwing down their rifles and running like hell. It's an important enough motive that we're willing to give our lives for it. So when the freaks start chanting \"google goggle, we accept you,\" and Olga Baclanova viciously rejects them and refuses to be an honorary member of their minority group, it's like a soldier ripping off his Medal of Honor and throwing it in the general's face.It's all pretty shocking, no matter how you look at it.", "Over the years, I've seen \"Freaks\" perhaps four times \u0096 all in theatres and on cinema screens in revivals. I've never seen it on TV, though I imagine it's been shown there.It's fascinating and hypnotically watchable still, not always for the right reasons. Yes, it's exploitive of the \"freaks.\" Yet given their opportunities in 1932, when they were either confined in institutions or exhibited in sideshows all over the world, the film gives them a curious dignity simply by offering them a one-time appearance in a Hollywood film that demanded more of them (some of them) than mere sideshow antics. The script, of course, also gives them \"dignity\" of a kind, at least relative to the prejudices of the times (i.e., \"Don't betray the freaks or they'll turn on you, cut you up, and make you one of them.\").That the film was shocking in its day, and often banned, says far more about audiences of the '30s than the actual film. The only truly powerful sequence is the brilliant \"storm\" sequence that climaxes \"Freaks.\" Emotionally, it is perfectly positioned in the film's structure: audiences inwardly understand and root for the \"freaks\" creeping and slithering through the mud beneath the wagon wheels to exact their revenge . . . while simultaneously being frightened of them and of what's to come. A brilliant and inspired sequence that deserves its legendary status.The remainder of \"Freaks,\" though entirely watchable, is not always watchable for the right reasons, as mentioned.Namely the dialogue and the acting. The structure is fine. But many of the lines are stilted and phony, even for films of that era. None of the \"freaks\" were trained actors. Such careers simply didn't exist in those days. Midget Daisy Earles (as Frieda) does perhaps the best job. Yet even she has no notion (nor experience) of how to sustain a character arc. Her brother, Harry Earles (as Hans), has tremendous vitality in his role, but no idea how to deliver these lines convincingly. Yet he's a good instinctive actor, as witness his silent moments in the film. Olga Baclanova as Cleopatra certainly holds the screen, and is the \"best\" actor in the cast. Hers must have been a difficult task \u0096 playing a completely despicable circus diva with no redeeming value whatsoever. Henry Victor as Hercules? Mediocre.Tod Browning's VISION for this film was / is breathtaking. \"Contrast real physical mutants with 'normal' people, and get the audience to identify with the 'freaks.' Then take them through a murderous, mutilating, emotionally wrenching climax.\" That's a challenge in 2005, much less 73 years ago.Browning's decision to use real \"freaks\" as opposed to made-up actors is noble and brave and true. But so intense were the prejudices of the day that that single decision affected every decision that followed. No \"name\" actor would agree to appear in the cast, citing \"disgust\" and worse. Five writers are credited on IMDb with the script \u0096 always a bad sign. None of the \"freaks\" had any real acting training or careers as actors. Much of the cast were amateurs, in other words, and it shows.Whatever tensions are generated by the story's structure dissipate whenever the lead midgets are on screen. Though Daisy Earles has some intermittent moments of effectiveness, Harry Earles does not. He almost sounds as if he's delivering his lines phonetically.Absent good actors in the lead roles (Baclanova overacts continually, but it works in context with her character), I've often wondered what \"Freaks\" might have been as a silent film.The two great set-pieces (the wedding sequence and the \"storm\" climax) are amazing \u0096 for entirely different reasons.At the wedding, the \"freaks\" are obviously having a grand time \"acting\" for Hollywood's cameras, while Baclanova (convincingly) goes over the top. The sequence is disturbing on more than one level. First, it's impossible to believe that silly \"One of us!\" chant. Yet it's disturbing at the same time it's phony. Possibly it was accepted as \"real\" in 1932, but I doubt it. Second, you have an actress who was reportedly sweet and kind to her co-stars, having to behave abominably with them on camera. How did Browning explain all this to some of his mentally child-like \"freaks?\" Visually, the wedding sequence is nothing out of the ordinary. Emotionally, it is wrenching \u0096 both within the story structure and outside the fiction: this and several other scenes that are blatantly exploitive beg the question, \"How were these people treated? Did they understand what was going on?\"From all reports, the \"freaks\" were treated with respect and appreciation.The \"storm\" climax, on the other hand, is simply stunning cinema. Silent, except for the deafening thunderstorm, it is brilliantly lit, shot and edited. It is also emotionally jolting. Here, finally, the \"freaks\" we have identified and empathized with are reduced to monstrous \"things\" snaking through mud puddles in the dark of night. They're on their way to do God-Knows-What to the \"normals.\" But by now, the audience has realized that the \"normals\" are really the \"freaks,\" and vice versa.That's an amazing level of dual-audience identification and sophistication for 1932 \u0096 or even today.\"Freaks\" is a failed enterprise in many ways. But Tod Browning's VISION of it was so audacious that it continues to stir controversy even now.The ending seems abrupt. Yet what other image could so immediately, efficiently, crystallize the themes of all that's gone before?", "It's a shame that the public really wasn't ready for this kind of movie 81 years ago. It was very shocking for its time, and it remains potent today. It makes its impact based on the extraordinary camaraderie between the \"freaks\" at a travelling carnival, and the support they show for each other.Director Tod Browning, basing his movie on a story by Tod Robbins, made the bold move of using real sideshow attractions, and it's not surprising that this would bother a movie-going public who only feel comfortable when they can see the zipper on the monsters' costume. Ultimately, this movie is very sympathetic to the plight of freaks, and in the end shows that the so-called \"normal\" people can be the true monsters.A cold hearted, greedy trapeze artist named Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) attaches herself to midget Hans (Harry Earles), letting him shower her with gifts knowing full well that he's got money. Once his comrades realize the true darkness of her personality - especially a wedding party where she expresses disgust at the thought of being like them - they're ripe for revenge, gathering together on a dark and stormy night. (One will never forget the sight of the freaks crawling through the mud towards Cleopatras' lunk headed strongman boy toy Hercules (Henry Victor)).Of course, not all of the \"normal\" characters are evil; Wallace Ford as lively clown Phroso and Leila Hyams as the kind hearted Venus are friends to the freaks. But when Cleopatra and Hercules push the freaks too far, it's all too understandable when the revenge comes.It's a real shame that this film had such a negative effect on Brownings' career. But, fortunately, in the years since its release, loyal audiences have realized its value and have come to regard it as one of the finer horror films of its era.10 out of 10.", "Not Easy going, even Today, with our Jaded Modern Movie going Sensibilities. After all, we have seen it all, right? Think again. You have Never Seen Anything like this.Using Real Humans with assorted Deformities and Defects as \"Actors\" and letting them \"Act\" and not just Expose Themselves to the Gawking Hayseeds, this Unique Opportunity allowed Them to Create an Exceptional Ensemble of eccentricity..Obviously, not for all Tastes, and in Retrospect and Ironically, a Stand Alone \"Curiosity\".It's Difficult to clearly Understand the Director's Motivation to make this Movie. Paradigms Change, Cultural Values Change, Laws Change, Mindsets Change, but, the Thing that does Not Change is a need for Tolerance in a Not so Tolerant World.This Strange Film does indeed Stir Empathy as it Entertains, but Does Not Exploit, in the \"Horror\" Genre with the Help of the Brave and Willing Cast."], "tt0022929": ["I can't believe that I'm the first one to review this film here. Many of us are more familiar with the all-star 1933 remake by Universal Pictures which faithfully adheres to the original almost scene by scene. Even stock footage of the castle and its moat were reused by Universal Pictures. The original is decidedly superior and has a much more atmospheric Blue Room set than Universal Pictures came up with which more or less looks like any old bedroom in the castle. The DVD print I purchased from Sinister Cinema is Region Free and runs 66 minutes like its remake. The subtitles are in English.I've seen four film adaptations of this story; the aforementioned two and Universal Pictures' 1938 remake \"The Missing Guest\", and its 1944 remake \"Murder in the Blue Room\" (complete with The Andrews Sisters-like trio!) I like them all with the 1932 version the best, followed by the 1933 version, the 1938 version, and the 1944 version. Fans should definitely check this version out. There is also a Czech version made after the German original and before Universal Pictures' 1933 version called \"Zahada modr\u00e9ho pokoje\" (1933) available thru eBay. It's PAL-Region 2. I understand it doesn't have English subtitles, but it too adheres closely to the German original.", "This is an interesting movie. I found it when going through Letterboxd for horror from 1932. I thought that this was streaming on YouTube but noticed the year and the cast was different. It turns out this was remade in 1933 by Universal. Luckily, I found a copy on eBay of this original German film.Synopsis: unsolved murders in a locked room years before are rehashed when more tragedy strikes in the same place.We start this movie in the castle belonging to Robert von Hellberg (Theodor Loos). He lives there with his daughter Irene (Else Elster). They are having a birthday party for her. In attendance are Axel Brinck (Hans Adalbert Schlettow) who is a marine officer. There is also Frank F\u00e1rber (Wolfgang Staudte) and Thomas Brandt (Peter Wolff). From what I'm gathering, they all want to marry Irene. Thomas is the most forward and Irene laughs it off.To wind down the night, Robert is asked to tell the story of the blue room. This is a room upstairs and always locked. It turns out that three people died there. The first was the sister to Robert who was thought to have fallen out of the window and into the moat. Her body was never found. The next night, Robert's best friend stayed in the room and was shot. The night after that had a detective staying there to solve what happened was also killed. All the deaths were thought to happen at 1 AM.Tommy sees an opportunity here. He suggests that the three suitors stay in the room consecutive nights. He volunteers to take this first one. The rules that are set up is that no one can bother them and they must stay the whole night. The next morning though, Tommy is gone. A search is conducted, but he's nowhere to be found. To solve what happened, Frank stays there the next night. Minutes after one in the morning, he's shot and killed.There are a list of potential suspects. There is Max (Reinhold Bernt) who is the chauffeur. We also have a house cleaner and even Robert. The police are called to solve what is happening as well. They are Schuster (Oskar Sima) and Kr\u00fcger (Gerhard Dammann). What is baffling everyone is that the room is locked each night, but it appears that someone is coming and going despite that. They need to solve the mystery of the blue room before it is too late.That should be enough to give you a basic idea of the story and introduce our cast. This is another interesting murder mystery from 1932. What is also intriguing to me is that this is another horror movie from Germany that was released this year. I've listed above that Erich Philippi is a writer on this. He is credited with the story, so I don't know if that means this is based on a short story ahead of it being made into this. Regardless, I wanted to toss that out before getting deeper into the movie itself.We have a basic set up that we see to this day. The lore is set up through the story told by Robert. It comes off as a ghost story. There is a bit of numerology here as the deaths in the room come in threes. The mystery is also unsolved so it is a good set up for me. Building from this, I like that Thomas sees his chance to prove how tough he is by staying in the room first. It is also his idea for this competition. I like that it plays out like a curse as the deaths that happen in there line up with the ones in the past. This is solid writing to me.With that introduced, this is an early murder mystery as I said. There is Schuster and Kr\u00fcger trying to solve this case. They interrogate Robert, Paul (Paul Henckels), Betty (Betty Bird), Max along with Irene and Axel. I like that they're doing good police work to figure this out. Everyone is a suspect. There is also the mystery of how whoever is guilty is getting in and out of the room with it locked. I did guess this, especially since it's a castle. This movie is using a bit of the 'old dark house' subgenre that I love. I'll admit, I should have guessed who the killer was and I didn't. I'll commend the movie, but the ending didn't necessarily shock me either. This movie does play it straight that there could be a sensible explanation or there could be a supernatural angle as well.There's not much more I can say with the story so I'll go over to the acting. I thought it was solid across the board. Loos works as the father here. He feels like someone who is respected, but also fits as one of the suspects. Elster is fine. She isn't given a lot, but she does plead with all the men to not stay in that room. She doesn't want to tempt fate which works. Schlettow and Staudte were both solid along with Wolff in his limited role. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.Finally for the filmmaking. I thought that the cinematography was good. It doesn't stand out but fits the era. I did want to commend the setting. I like this being set in a castle that looks modern enough while still having a moat and a bit of the 'old dark house' to it. We don't get a lot in the way of the effects, but it also doesn't need them. It isn't that type of movie. Other than that, the soundtrack fit for what was needed. They did do good things with the sound design though. Hearing things off screen to draw characters like music or gunshots works.In conclusion, this movie was enjoyable. It might not be for people that watch murder mysteries, as you will see troupes that are known now. Regardless, I think that for when this came out it was still fresh. I like the setup of this 'ghost' story and how the events are mimicked. It feels like life imitating art. The acting is good to bring the characters to life. I'd say this is also a well-made film overall. It isn't going to blow you away, but there's a reason that Universal remade this immediately for an American audience. This is an above average movie for me overall.My Rating: 7 out of 10."], "tt0023101": ["This is a talkie remake of WEST OF ZANZIBAR (1928) which, alas, is one of the few of the legendary Tod Browning/Lon Chaney collaborations which has eluded me thus far. To begin with, I was shocked to learn that William Cowen (who only directed 6 films during his brief career, this being his most substantial effort) made the lackluster OLIVER TWIST (1933; which I watched only a few weeks ago) soon after! Anyway, KONGO is not really a horror film \u0096 but, with the accent being on sadism and degradation, it certainly makes the most of the liberal Pre-Code attitude of the time. Besides, you can almost feel the humid jungle atmosphere: actually, apart from a few of the Chaney films and this one, MGM did several other African-set adventures during this time including TRADER HORN (1931), RED DUST (1932) and the Johnny Weissmuller/Maureen O'Sullivan \"Tarzan\" films (1932-42). Walter Huston is as commanding as ever in Chaney's old role (though he had originated it himself on stage!) \u0096 even if he wasn't quite his equal, I think, particularly where pathos is concerned. Interestingly, the film's plot is also quite similar to that of THE SHANGHAI GESTURE (1941) \u0096 which also stars Huston but where his role is more or less reversed! The entire cast is excellent (C. Henry Gordon' role, replacing Lionel Barrymore from the original, is brief but pivotal) including, surprisingly, the 'romantic' leads (Virginia Bruce and Conrad Nagel) \u0096 though that's because their roles are complex rather than insipid, as was the norm during this time. As for Lupe Velez \u0096 who had been Chaney's daughter in WHERE EAST IS EAST (1929) \u0096 the passage of just 3 years has seen her relegated to 'other woman' types and, despite receiving second billing, her role is basically a supporting one (especially since Velez practically disappears during the latter stages of the film).The film drags in spots and is perhaps overlong for its purpose; however, there's an abrupt passage of time \u0096 in which we never get to see Bruce's descent to the skids at Huston's hands \u0096 which confused me at first into thinking that she was actually her own mother! Huston exerts his grip on the fearsome, gullible natives by the use of magic tricks (including, ironically, the decapitation routine I had seen only a couple of days earlier in Browning's THE SHOW [1927]!; could this have been used in WEST OF ZANZIBAR, too?) and a lot of rather silly chanting of mumbo-jumbo. While I knew of the plot revelation, it's still very effectively handled; indeed, given Cowen's non-reputation, I have to wonder how this film compares scene by scene with the original, i.e. whether the director here consciously copied Browning and that's why KONGO is so powerful! Curiously, Huston's comeuppance at the hands of the natives he had exploited for so long is strikingly similar to that of ISLAND OF LOST SOULS (1933) \u0096 though it's considerably less graphic (also because here we're not told what really happened to him {is it the same with WEST OF ZANZIBAR?}, whereas we know what Dr. Moreau's fate is going to be without having to actually witness it).I doubt that the film's reputation is solid enough to justify a stand-alone (and most probably bare-bones) DVD release from Warners \u0096 and, despite the obvious connection, I would think it'd be out of place on an eventual second set of Lon Chaney vehicles; still, I would very much like to have an official DVD edition of this one, also because my copy froze for an instant during a crucial scene", "Walter Huston plays Flint, a paraplegic living in a self-made ivory empire in deepest, darkest Africa.  Flint is cruel, brutal, and autocratic.  Using simple stage magic and sleight of hand to make the superstitious natives believe he is semi-divine, he also employs a handful of Europeans to help him run his trade.  He is a vengeful man and his vengeance when it comes to an old rival and his daughter is horrifying.  Some of the implications are far darker and more grim than would be permitted to be openly portrayed in a film of the 1930s.Until it aired recently on a cable television movie channel, I was totally unaware of this film.  It is impressive.  It is set in the tropics and just watching it makes you want to sweat.  Walter Huston's chilling performance as Flint is excellent.  The supporting cast is solid and the romance that blossoms between two characters seems far more genuine than many such relationships that are portrayed in other films of the early 1930s.  This is a film that is not to be missed by anyone who enjoys classic suspense or adventure.", "Walter Huston steps into Lon Chaney's wheelchair to play the evil crippled magician commanding a \"juju\" cult of natives who burn women alive. Lupe Velez is on hand [and narrowly escapes getting her tongue twisted out with a wire]. Enter blonde Virginia Bruce, a convent girl forced into prostitution in Zanzibar, but now a hopeless alcoholic. Enter Conrad Nagel, a doctor who is now a hopeless drug addict [his cure involves being covered with leeches and buried up to his neck in a swamp]. Don't worry: there's still MORE plot! Everyone sweats a lot, on leftover sets from RED DUST, but the direction is rudimentary and lacks the courage of the plot's kinkiness. Still, it's some kind of must-see since they sure don't make them like this anymore!", "If anyone believes that 1930s movies are just fluff pieces with lots of inane musical numbers, this film will dispel that opinion. The great Walter Huston plays Flint, a crippled and borderline insane ruler of a remote African kingdom. When Ann (Virginia Bruce) comes by, Flint keeps her captive and repeatedly tortures her, believing that she is the daughter of the man who paralyzed him. Along comes Kingsland (Conrad Nagel), a doctor who is addicted to some kind of jungle root. Flint torments Kingsland by withholding the root and insisting that Kingsland cure him of his paraplegia. Lupe Velez as Flint's love-hungry mistress livens up the picture, until Ann's father (C. Henry Gordon) arrives with a shocking secret that provides the twist ending of the film.I suppose the movie isn't for all tastes, but I certainly like it. The plot includes murders, drug addiction, torture, jealousy, a decapitation, bizarre native rituals, and a strong theme of sadism which runs throughout. This little gem could not have been made just two years later. A must for pre-Code fans.", "I have been unable to get the original of this, made by Todd Browning. Browning is one of the most interesting filmmakers I know and one of the reasons is that he is unafraid to dive directly into dark corners and send back purely cinematic reports. I believe this is very similar, a \"talkie\" remake that only refers to the prior history and sticks to Africa.You may not know the story. Its pretty rich. A stage magician has his wife stolen by another man who takes her to deepest Africa to essentially rape the people and resources. In the process, the magician is crippled. He also goes to Africa and builds his own empire. Instead of force, he uses guile to fool the natives with his magic. Drugs and force of character enslave two women, a white henchman and later a visiting doctor.One of these woman he believes to be the daughter of his exwife (the slut!) and the man who stole her. The two men are the two white powers in the region. The cripple does everything he can to \"cripple\" his competition and ultimately the two are gathered where he reveals his ultimate punishment, that he has defiled this man's daughter.The whole setup is sexual, and particularly the reason that the story has to be transported to Africa. Then more than now, black men, sweat and throbbing drums wove a tapestry of primitive desire against which the rutting of whites could have context. In this case, the sex is punitive.The story turns, and we learn that the girl is in fact the cripple's daughter. Thus defeated, the magician sacrifices his life to see that girl escapes, after she forgives him.There's an odd scene in here, seemingly inserted late. The words don't match the mouth movements. The cripple as he is preparing to \"save\" his newly discovered daughter, she is unconscious and he embraces her. He says that this is the \"first\" and last time he will do so. Yet earlier it is plain that she has been sexually ravished, drugged and imprisoned. Its precode, but I suppose there's only so far you can go.Its pretty amazing dramatically, allowing all sorts of histrionics. There are few calm moments; everyone is at the dramatic max all the time, and it gets tedious. The magic is underwhelming. The surrounding blacks incredibly gullible. I can at the moment only imagine how Todd would have handled this, but I can't wait. Until then, I will ravish this and keep it prisoner in my own jungle.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.", "This is a remake of the Lon Chaney film, WEST OF ZANZIBAR--a silent film that was made just a few years earlier. The original film and this remake both are quite shocking even when seen today because of the amazingly brutal and cruel script. Both films are very similar, but since KONGO is a sound film, the shrillness of the film seems even more intense. Considering that Chaney had died of cancer two years earlier, the studio had no choice but to find another actor the the lead. While no one would ever accuse Walter Huston of being subtle in this film, his kooky and over the top performance worked because the film had no pretense--it was meant to be sadistic, sleazy and low-brow. After all, this film was made before the new and strengthened production code, so it was still an \"anything goes\" world in Hollywood.The film is about a crazed magician (Huston) who lives in the middle of the African jungle. The natives are all ignorant savages and Huston controls their murderous impulses by convincing them he's a powerful witch doctor. In reality, he does a lot of really cool stage magician tricks and this is the most exciting part of the film. Apparently, he and his sleazy sidekicks have been there for many years amassing a fortune in ivory, though instead of taking the money and running, they stay because apparently Huston has a cunning plan. Only later do they realize that they've all spent years in this hellhole because kooky Huston is bent on a complicated plan for revenge. Like the original film, there is a twist and the plan backfires--leading to horrible complications.This is really not a good film in the traditional sense. There is TONS of overacting, the script is impossible to believe and the whole thing is very shrill to say the least. However, this and its strong Pre-Code sensibilities make it a fascinating film because of its excess--and that's pretty much the same way I felt about WEST OF ZANZIBAR. Both are indeed guilty pleasures.", "A white witch doctor rules his personal kingdom without mercy.  He terrifies the natives and controls his small group of lost souls with an iron hand. All with one burning goal in mind. This picture has so many stomach churning, heart wrenching elements to it, they are too many to count.  Walter Huston plays one of the most sadistic brutes ever portrayed on film.  Yet, we find, after all, the brute has a heart.  Virginia Bruce, in easily the best role of her career, plays a thoroughly debased victim.  Kidnapped by Huston in a twisted plot to punish the man he thinks is her father, she proves that inherent goodness is impossible to destroy.  Watching him desperately try is what makes this film so worthwhile.  If you get the chance - don't miss it.", "This is one of the most perverse pre-code films ever made. Drug addiction, rape, incest, nudity, you name it. Every time I show it to people their jaws drop, I burned a TCM showing onto DVD but would love to see an official MGM release.There is no comparison to the original, \"West of Zanzibar\". As great as Chaney was, and in my opinion he was one of, if not the, greatest actors that ever lived, \"Kongo\" beats just about every film I've ever seen for sheer seaminess. C'mon, Virginia Bruce a forcibly drug-addicted heroine forced into prostitution by her father?\"Freaks\" has nothing on this one.", "Dark deeds abound in the jungle in this tense melodrama which really racks up the suspense during some key scenes. Forget any preconceptions you may have had about '30s films bearing little resemblance to real life, instead portraying the idealistic lives of the upper class; this is grim, gritty and in your face drama, with real people for a change. It's surprising to see that the film hasn't dated in any way, in fact it's probably more relevant to our times than it has been to any other. In a way, it's ahead of itself.The adult nature of the film comes from the many themes running through it. Power, racism, prostitution, rape, murder, insanity, alcoholism, and drug addiction are all addressed as every character in the film suffers from, or suffers by, one of these things. These make the film a very intriguing one to watch, and a long way away from other contemporary fare. The women here are greedy and dirty, corrupt and degraded - unlike the other perfect, angelic figures in the likes of Dracula and FRANKENSTEIN.The characters are realistic, fleshed out and solid. Walter Huston steals the show as the manic paraplegic who doesn't let the lack of legs stop him from climbing ropes and crawling all over the shop. The other people in the film are very good too, there isn't a single bad performance. As well as the true-to-life issues there are plenty of fantastical adventure elements, such as an infamous scene of a man being tied up and lowered to his neck into a river full of leeches; some fire sacrifices, bizarre native rituals, and even some shooting. The eventual ending, where justice prevails and the cruel Flint is overwhelmed by natives tired of his tricks, is expected, yet hits home because just before then Flint undergoes a humane change of heart and realises his sins.", "It won't be shown during \"family\" hours, so stay up or set your VCR. This pre-Code tale of revenge, sex, brutality, and, ultimately, redemption was one of Walter Huston's best performances (not that he was capable of a bad one). It's like a train wreck--you don't want to watch, but you can't turn away. Virginia Bruce is excellent as the innocent convent-educated girl who becomes a pawn in Huston's diabolical revenge scheme. Drug addiction and abuse of women run rampant, along with racism and superstition. Sweaty, dirty, and disheveled characters, sex, violence, drugs, and great performances. It doesn't get any better than this. Even though you'll guess the ending early on, you'll still want to watch it, and you'll want to see more of Walter Huston's films.", "A beautiful, young woman is mentally and physically tortured by a rival of her father. Bizarre, to say the least. VERY very brutal even by today's standards. The film opens with a decapitation! There's also rape, whippings, drug abuse, torture, incest...basically the works. It's very surprising that MGM let this film be made let alone released! It's a really good movie but very tough. For strong stomaches only.", "... since Huston played the part of Dead Legs on the stage prior to Lon Chaney starring in \"West of Zanzibar\" in 1928. In spite of that I think I still prefer \"West of Zanzibar\" for reasons that have nothing to do with either Huston or Chaney - they both did great in their respective interpretations of the role of \"Dead Legs\".\"West of Zanzibar\" was shorter and more to the point and it also did a better job of adding some scenes that were missing from \"Kongo\". The beginning of \"West of Zanzibar\" shows Dead Legs when he was Phroso, the magician, a happy man in love with his wife. It shows how his wife betrays his love, how hurt he is when he learns the truth and how the man who stole his wife caused the injury that paralyzed him. It then shows him two years later when he finds his wife dead, with her child near her side, a child he assumes was fathered by the man who ruined his life (Lionel Barrymore). This makes Chaney as Dead Legs a more sympathetic character since we see firsthand the evil that was done to him. It doesn't excuse what he has become or done 20 years later, but at least the viewer has a plausible explanation.As for C. Henry Gordon as the object of Dead Legs' revenge, he just can't hold a candle to Lionel Barrymore in the parallel role in West of Zanzibar. For those who haven't seen Lionel Barrymore in the silents, he really could play an effective villain believe it or not. So what did I like better? For one, Conrad Nagel as the drug addicted doctor trying to reclaim his humanity was a revelation. MGM had a habit of pigeon holing him into rather stiff roles in high society drawing room dramas and this really showed his breadth.The sudden change of heart in Dead Legs is the only thing that was a bit over the top in both films. When Dead Legs finds out he's been responsible for breaking his own daughter's spirit rather than that of his nemesis, and he makes what can only be a lame attempt at making amends, he has an unbelievable line for the girl - \"Time is a great healer\". Huh? Look at what time did to him. He just spent 20 years of his life thinking of nothing but revenge, becoming more depraved and indifferent to human life with each passing year. And he thinks time can heal this girl's memory of repeated rape and degradation? Don't get me wrong, I'm not panning this movie. I'm just comparing this very good film version of the story with a nearly perfect version. One thing Kongo really has going for it is the precode angle, and I'm not talking about just frank sexuality. Most precode films are tame in comparison to modern standards, and some are almost quaint. This film has a grittiness and depravity to it that is still gripping today. Highly recommended.", "This movie is stunning. Made before the Hays Code came down hard on Hollywood - this movie and (many like them made during the Depression) - tried everything they could to get audiences to part with their hard-earned and hard to find money. So, many of the early thirties movies were filled with sex, drugs, pathos, fallen women, forbidden love and anything else naughty. People just wanted to forget and certainly anything set in the far off lands of Africa made people dream and fantasize and drool. I was lucky enough to see this on a movie screen last night at a retrospective on Pre-Hays Code movies. And this movie is unbelievable. Walter Huston chews up the scenery and the jungle and everything else in it. Revenge! He wants revenge for the man who \"kicked in his spine\"! Huston keeps a sign up in his place with the words \"He Sneered\" on it - to remind Huston that the man SNEERED, SNEERED mind you! as he kicked in his spine. And his plot for revenge is mind-boggling and hilarious. Yes, this movie is dated and the poor actors dressed up as ignorant savages can only be pitied - (they even have the large rings in their noses!!!). But as a sweaty, dirty jungle movie - they don't get any better than this. Seek this weirdo out!", "Walter Huston got to recreate his stage role of 'Deadlegs' Flint when Kongo was done as a sound film in 1932. The original production ran for 135 performances and then a silent version entitled West Of Zanzibar was done by MGM that starred Lon Chaney. So for those of you who marveled at Chaney's compelling performance in West Of Zanzibar, be advised that Huston actually created the part on Broadway.The jungle sets used for Trader Horn's interiors and later for the Tarzan films are put to good use in Kongo. The rest of it revolves around Walter Huston's equally compelling performance as a crippled degenerate paraplegic who rules a jungle kingdom with some equally degenerate associates and who keep the natives in line with some old magician's tricks. That and a knowledge of the narcotic effect of some of the jungle plants.Huston lives for only one reason to exact a terrible vengeance on another white overlord of some jungle turf, the man who crippled him and stole his wife at the same time, C. Henry Gordon. The instrument of his revenge will be Virginia Bruce who is Gordon's convent raised daughter who Huston lures into his jungle domain.Lupe Velez is on hand as Huston's mistress of undetermined racial origin since she certainly doesn't look like any of the natives. Lupe does have a roving eye however since her sex life with Huston has to be somewhat limited. She gleefully aids in Huston's depravities however.Kongo in one sense takes a really horribly racist point of view toward the natives. At the same time however it certainly doesn't show the whites as anything noble. Both Huston and Gordon aren't hypocrites, you won't see them mouthing any pablum about the white man's burden.It's a dated film, but Walter Huston will keep you riveted to your seats with what he does with this part.", "Kongo (1932)*** (out of 4)Remake of the 1928 Tod Browning/Lon Chaney film West of Zanzibar pretty much follows the same story. A paralyzed madman (Walter Huston) rules a colony in Africa and plans on getting revenge on the man who crippled him by torturing his daughter (Virginia Bruce). This pretty much follows the story of the original right from the start to the end and that includes the infamous twist in the story but that doesn't hamper matters too much since Huston gives a terrific performance. He makes a great villain, although he doesn't quite reach Chaney's level and there are several times when you can see him moving his legs when you shouldn't. The biggest advantage of this remake is that it keeps the brutal attitude of the original. This is a pretty graphic film with dope addicts, body burning, various murders, rape, sexual assault and even a tad bit of nudity can be witnessed. This is certainly a very strong film for its time but I'd recommend watching the Chaney version first. The Chaney film and this one would make a great double-feature DVD from Warner. Conrad Nagel co-stars.", "Superior remake of the silent film West of Zanzibar, which starred Lon Chaney. The plot's about a crippled white man named 'Dead Legs' Flint who lives in the Kongo with his henchmen and mistress. He keeps the restless natives at bay with some magic tricks while he plots revenge against the man who crippled him and stole his wife eighteen years prior.I can't think of a better actor from this period to step into Chaney's shoes than Walter Huston, who starred in a wide variety of exceptional movies, usually with interesting characters and daring subject matter. He's my favorite actor from the Pre-Code era. Huston's terrific here, overacting in the best way, playing one of the most vile characters in screen history. Although I should point out he doesn't match Chaney at pretending to have \"dead legs.\" In some scenes, such as when Huston climbs a rope to the upper floor of his hut, you can see his knees bend. Chaney's commitment to physical transformation in his parts was unmatched, then or now. Excellent scar-face makeup on Huston, though. Lupe Velez is very sexy as Flint's mistress Tula, who wears a strapless dress throughout that always looks as if it could fall off at any minute. I barely recognized her as the same actress from the lame Mexican Spitfire comedies she would make years later. Virginia Bruce gives arguably her finest turn here as the poor victim of Flint's madness. She's amazing! Conrad Nagel does well as the drug-addict doctor who falls in love with her. Mitchell Harris and Forrester Harvey are good as Flint's dirty, sweaty underlings.It's a fascinating and disturbing Pre-Code movie with great performances all around. The script is gritty and tough with not a single character who escapes unscathed. You might need to take a bath after watching this one but it's worth it. One final note -- given the period in which this was made and the African setting, there are elements that will offend some. So if you're someone who usually gets upset when you see these things in older films, consider yourself warned.", "Your best bet when viewing this film is not to take it too seriously or you will have a bad taste in your mouth for a week. It is a raw, sadistic, unbelievable story containing every possible type of aberrant behavior that could be translated to film at the time. Pre-code at its best, it puts all others in the shade. Where else can you have drug addiction, incest, murder, torture, human sacrifice and rape wrapped up in an over the top story with some pretty good actors? Walter Houston plays \"Dead Legs\" Flint, a paraplegic holding court in an African village and vowing revenge on the man (C. Henry Gordon) who kicked him in the spine thus paralyzing him. Keeping Houston close company is Lupe Velez as his Portugese(?) mistress, Conrad Nagel as a drug ravaged physician and Virginia Bruce as the daughter (or not) of his sworn enemy. Houston's aforementioned revenge on Gordon for his paralysis is taken out vicariously on Bruce in unremitting style, off-screen as well as on, ......and it is nasty!!! Bruce, plays without make-up which adds to her interpretation as she is transformed into an abused, drug addicted whore and she is in a word....fantastic.I have only touched on the essential plot of this film. There are other aspects that amplify the scenario, such as the attempted tongue removal scene..........yikes!!!This film was a shocker at the time and frankly, still is.....it is downright unpleasant. One of the rawest of the pre-code films, it is a must-see for fans of that film era and you will either despise it or love it. The word \"unclean\" comes to mind and you might feel like taking a shower after viewing.", "See this film especially if you are young enough to think that no one in films had illicit sex, took drugs, or committed psychopathic murder before \"Pulp Fiction\". This film is a bizarre ride. Never seen anything like it. I recommend it highly!", "KONGO, starring Walter Huston, is a 1932 talkie remake of Tod Browning's silent WEST OF ZANZIBAR(1928)that had starred Lon Chaney which in itself was based on the 1926 Broadway play \"Kongo\" that starred Walter Huston. Both films were produced by MGM. KONGO is basically MGM refilming the scenario used by Browning for the silent version WEST OF ZANZIBAR. Think of director Jack Conway using Browning's 1925 scenario of THE UNHOLY THREE to film the 1930 remake. Those who have seen WoZ will recognize this or be familiar with it. KONGO also reuses some of the footage shot for the silent version WoZ with inserted dialogue over and sound effects. I thought I was pretty familiar with MGM's offbeat material. But this film is a rarity and is almost never shown at TCM nor is it available on DVD, so that would explain my not having seen it. But I was finally able to view KONGO in it's entirety and in a decent print after hearing about for so many years. The elaborate prologue in Browning's WoZ explaining what happened to Flint(in the silent played by Chaney who is called Phroso) is gone in KONGO and we start with Flint and his troupe already in Africa. Throughout KONGO Flint(Huston) will make references to his life before Africa and what led him to go to Africa. All the main characters from WoZ are here in KONGO. Albeit Tiny Ward's character of Tiny in the silent film is replaced by curvaceous Lupe Velez as Tula undoubtedly to add more 'cheesecake' to the talkie and the fact that Ward's and Velez's characters in the two films are minor parts. Velez had acted impressively with Chaney in Tod Browning's 1929 WHERE EAST IS EAST where she played Chaney's daughter. Sexy Virginia Bruce replaces sexy Mary Nolan from the silent WoZ as Chaney's long lost, convent protected and later jungle defiled daughter. Conrad Nagel, is an actor I've never understood the appeal of, but he was a popular silent era leading man appearing in numerous dramas and costume films. He seems to have been popular with star actresses and he also appeared in the lost Browning/Chaney film London AFTER MIDNIGHT(1927). Nagel's best film IMHO is HELL DIVERS(1931) as the no-nonsense squadron commander in charge of Wally Beery and Clark Gable. However in KONGO Nagel plays the alcoholic doctor that had been played much better by Warner Baxter in the silent WoZ. One gets the impression MGM didn't think much of the material as they gave it to a seemingly unknown director, William Cowen, to direct. Why not they have given it to Tod Browning to redo as a classic daring Pre-Code talkie? Cowen, for all his lackluster, turned in an appropriately grimy picture which complements it's silent predecessor. Alas this should've been expected as Cowen followed the outline of the silent version to a T. Both Lupe Velez and Virginia Bruce provide ample doses of 'cheesecake' which in this film seems to have been more of the intent compared to the silent version WoZ. Velez wears a low shouldered wrap and is continuously moistened down sexying up her beautiful skin. Bruce has a scene in which in a tussle with Mitchell Lewis her 'ahem' b*****s quite revealingly and quickly pop out of her open shirt. Certainly such a scene would be impossible once the Production Code came into place in 1934. Bruce, heavy chested and well proportioned, appears at the same time a tad skinny and looks malnourished which works well once she gets to Flint's jungle compound. Bruce also has a physical earthiness that works and would have been just as good or even better than Mary Nolan's in the silent WoZ. So in closing this was a treat to view this film. It is a concoction of the weird, like FREAKS produced that same year at MGM. Perhaps Warner Brothers or whoever now owns the copyright to this obscure gem will get it out on DVD in the near future.", "This is the first of what I am sure will be many films I am inspired to watch after reading about them in the amazing 'Unsung Horrors' volume from the people of We Belong Dead. That this is a Pre-Code film there is no doubt from the very start and the movie proceeds to assault us with the grubby and the disgusting; physical and sexual violence and, inevitably given the jungle setting, all manner of non-pc attitudes and behaviour. Walter Huston plays the crazed control freak, in a wheelchair and with a monkey on a lead, for goodness sake and calls his native adviser, Fuzzy!! Amidst all the degradation and abuse comes a hero but arriving high on drugs does not make for the most auspicious of entrances, though he does calm down and eventually play his part in saving the day. Lupe Velez is marvellous as the bad man's mistress and plays it with much bounce you might say, unrestrained before the Code. Still shocking today, this must have really upset some back in the day and is surely one of the key films leading to the tightening up of restrictions.", "As pre-Code as they get, and very un-MGM-like for 1932, this stage success and remake of \"West of Zanzibar\" is both hilariously racist and quite creepy, with nightmarish imagery and lots of sadism. Walter Huston, hamming it up entertainingly, is the warped, lame white-boss-man whose appetite for vengeance leads him to make a disastrous mistake. He's surrounded by some MGM players at the modest peaks of their careers: Conrad Nagel as a drug-addicted doctor, Lupe Velez as Huston's two-timing mistress, and most memorably, Virginia Bruce (without makeup, very unusual for the time, and emoting affectingly) as a convent school girl driven into prostitution and drink. The love story between her and Nagel is more convincing than usual: These two do seem made for each other, and there's little of the hearts-and-flowers romantic excess of the era. But the prime appeal is how beastly Huston is to all around him, and how memorably he gets his comeuppance. The natives' ooga-booga costumes, dances, and obeisance to the white massa are kind of hard to take, and William J. Cowen's direction is workmanlike at best. But the piece is, in its own way, as horrifying and memorable as that other atypical MGM horror classic of 1932, \"Freaks.\"", "The acting was so avant-garde for a 1932 version, I had to go back to the schedule twice to make sure it was filmed in the early days. I've seen Emmy-winning 1999 TV soaps that didn't have the shine the soapy scenes here have. Lupe Velez was, to me, a very untalented stock actress until I watched her in this tropical human-condition story. She almost outshines Walter in her portrayal of a love-starved wench stuck in an outland of men. But both women did better, in my opinion, than some of the Actors' Guild graduates today.

Using a combination of cheap carnival tricks and sugar cubes, Flint got the natives addicted too and had them create a kingdom for himself in the most remote part of darkest Africa.Having his underling native Chief Fuzzy,Curtis Nero, create a 80 mile impregnable JuJu circle no one can come in or out of Flint's kingdom without him knowing about it and that's exactly how he want's it. For some 18 years Flint has been planning his revenge against Gregg Whitehall,C. Henry Gordon. Whitehall not only caused him to lose his ability to walk, by breaking Flint's spine, but stole his wife who he later had a daughter with Ann, Virginia Bruce. Now the time has come for the Boss-man to get even with him for past dues.Having destroyed his slave and Ivory trade business by having Fuzzy and his warriors knock off Whitehall's safari's in the jungle along the notorious JuJu circle Flint also had one of his flunkies Hogan, Mitchell Lewis, impersonate a white jungle preacher, Babcock. Hogan went to fetch Ann from a convent in Capetown and bring back to Flint in his jungle kingdom to be used as a human sacrifice together with her father Gregg Whitehall.Sick and demented the crippled Flint has Ann addicted to cheap brandy which causes her to come down with black fever that's slowly killing her. It's then when Fuzzy and his men find Dr. Kingsland ,Corad Nagel, lost and staggering around in the jungle and bring him back to the Boss-Man's place where things starts to unravel for him. It turns out that Kingsland's involvement with Ann who turns out to be not what Flint thought she was: It turns out that he's actually Ann's father!Kingsland addicted to the Bhang Root kicked that monkey off his back only to later have Flint's live-in maid and sex-slave Tula, Lupe Lopez,get him hooked back on it in order to bed down the handsome and sexy young doctor. Capturing Whitehall and about to do him in for what he did to him 18 years ago Flint is stunned to find out, with Kingsland confirming it with Ann's birth certificate, that he not Gregg Whitehall is her father.With the natives now whipped up into a frenzy screaming for blood, after Chief Fuzzy shot and killed Whitehall, and with no modern means of communications Flint couldn't get the word back to Fuzzy to call off Whitehalls assassination. Now Flint is desperate in preventing his \"daughter\" Ann to be immolated along with him which is an ancient native custom. Flint plays his last trick by holding off the angry and rampaging natives as Ann Dr. Kingsland and the rest of his crew Tula Hogan & Cookie, Forrester Harvey, make their way out of the jungle by a secret underground tunnel.It took Boss-Man Flint all these years to find out that the revenge that he was planning for Whitehall's daughter would in the end not only boomerang and bring him back to sanity; It would also give him the humanity and courage that he lost so long ago in the madness of the steaming and disease infested African jungle.", "Nearly 20 years before John Huston took his crew to the Congo to film his masterpiece with Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, his father Walter was on the MGM lot filming this terrific sound remake of Lon Chaney Sr.'s silent, \"West of Zanzibar\". This is a film you won't forget, with its exotic setting, crippled leading character (quite the villain!), a drugged out ingenue, and natives involved in human sacrifice. It's quite disturbing, coming from MGM the same year that they made two horror classics of similar controversial nature: \"Freaks\" and \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\". There's a lot in this film that will drop your jaw, but you won't turn away, even if disgusted, by the aura of this dark and creepy jungle film where revenge takes a vile turn, yet with some last minute twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat.The fantastic Walter Huston had played this part on stage long before Chaney took it to the screen, so with Chaney's death in 1930, who would be better to do the sound version? It is the type of film that could not be done even as quickly as two years after it was released because there are so many elements of the plot and details within it that went completely against the production code. Huston plays the wheelchair bound mad man living in the jungle and stirring up trouble with the natives, vowing revenge on C. Henry Gordon whom he believes stole his wife years ago and fathered a child with her. Huston sends one of his men (disguised as a priest!) to the convent school where the daughter (Virginia Bruce) has been living and brings her to him. Within a few seconds within the film, you see Bruce go from virginal beauty to drug and alcohol addicted prostitute, a far cry from the glamorous roles that Bruce (best known for being on the top of that huge cake set piece in \"The Great Ziegfeld\") played during her long tenure at MGM. But when Gordon shows up to find Bruce about to be made a sacrifice, he reveals a long held secret that threatens not only to destroy the mad Huston but Bruce as well.This violent, edgy and angry film is intense from start to finish, particularly with the shot of a screaming native girl about to be burnt alive as part of a sacrificial offering to the native's gods. Other natives chase the horrified Bruce as she is on line to be the next sacrifice some point down the road, plans changed by Gordon's arrival and Huston's desire to right his many wrongs. Lupe Velez gives a touching performance as Huston's possible mistress who becomes a target of his revenge at one point, threatened with having her tongue removed. Conrad Nagel plays an embittered young man who sobers up long enough to attempt to rescue Bruce from the evil Huston and the eager natives, wearing hideous costumes that imply all sorts of beastly activities. The gruesome themes of this movie can't be described in polite terms, so for anybody who comes across this film, at least warnings of some of those shocking elements should be made. But the ending truly wraps up everything with a surprising sacrifice, discovered by the cute chimpanzee who runs off in horror. The same chimp, having been obviously trained to slap Bruce in an earlier scene, is as far from \"Tarzan's\" Cheetah as you can get. In short, \"Kongo\" is a film that once you see, you can't easily forget. It truly is one that could give you nightmares."], "tt0023194": ["This was a bit different with Boris Karloff playing an Asian \"bad guy.\" He plays \"Fu Manchu,\" and man who sets out to get Genghis Khan's mask and sword which supposedly will give him the power to rule over millions of people.Despite the classic film casting of white people to play Asians, I found Karloff to be \"cool\" looking as was his evil daughter, a young Myrna Loy. I like Karen Morely, usually, but not in here where she plays an almost-hysterical daughter of one of the good guys.\"Fu Manchu\" shows some of his unique methods of torture, nothing graphic, thankfully - not like today's blood and guts.Some of this is amateurishly-done but overall it still a legitimate amount of real horror and terror and the cast certainly is entertaining. (\"Andy Hardy\" star Lewis Stone also is in here along with Jean Hersholt and Charles Starret.)Summary: a decent and almost-mystical adventure story that doesn't overstay its welcome, either, at a tidy 68 minutes. Pretty good stuff.", "It didn't surprise me in the least that The Mask Of Fu Manchu was produced by Cosmopolitan Pictures. Even though the title is a bit of a misnomer. It isn't about The Mask Of Fu Manchu, it's about the mask and sword of Ghenghis Khan which Boris Karloff as Fu Manchu wants to discover and appropriate for himself so he can become a kind of Far Eastern Mahdi.Cosmopolitan Pictures was the production outfit of William Randolph Hearst and while it's main reason for existence was to produce films for Marion Davies, it did produce other films. The Hearst press, especially on the West Coast was very big in stirring up anti-Chinese and anti- Japanese feelings among the white people constantly using the phrase The Yellow Peril to describe how if they're allowed to emigrate her they'll be taking over in a few generations. The fictional Fu Manchu fit the Hearst agenda quite nicely.In the Fu Manchu stories it's like Professor Moriarty was the main protagonist. Fu Manchu's particular Holmes is Commissioner Nayland Smith played by Lewis Stone as stout a representative of the United Kingdom and their imperial pretensions as ever went out in the noon day sun.As I said Fu Manchu is after the warrior symbols of Ghengis Khan so he can lead the Oriental people to their rightful place. Interestingly this Oriental messiah seems to have a number of black slaves doing his bidding in the film. The British government as personified by Nayland Smith wants archaeologists Jean Hersholt, David Torrance and Lawrence Grant to find the tomb and get this so the British can display it at the British Museum in London as a symbol of their superiority. Grant is kidnapped and tortured by Karloff, but Grant's daughter Karen Morley and her boyfriend, future Durango Kid Charles Starrett takes her father's place on the expedition.Though I think that The Mask Of Fu Manchu is every bit as racist in its attitudes as The Birth Of A Nation, like The Birth Of A Nation it has some great performances. Led of course by that master of horror, Boris Karloff. Karloff played so many different and varied types in his long career, being Chinese was no big deal for him to play. Later on Karloff kind of made it up to the Chinese people by playing the educated detective Mr. Wong who unlike Charlie Chan never spoke in fortune cookie aphorisms.Myrna Loy is Fu Manchu's 'unworthy' daughter and this is at the height of the phase in her career where she played Oriental temptresses. She conceives a real liking for Starrett to turn him into her Occidental boy toy. She's a willing and eager accomplice in her father's dirty deeds, perhaps to show herself as worthy.The Mask Of Fu Manchu is as racist a film as you can get, but it's also holding up quite well as entertainment. And who was ever more sinister on the screen than Boris Karloff playing anything?", "Created by British author Sax Rohmer, the evil Dr. Fu Manchu appeared for the first time in 1912, in a story serialized in one of the many pulp magazines of those years. While originally a personification of the racism present during the time of its creation (the infamous \"Yellow Peril\"), Fu Manchu has become one of the most famous characters in science fiction, serving as model to other villainous character as one of the earliest examples of the Supervillain archetype. The fascinating evil genius (and his nemesis, Sir Denis Nayland Smith) appeared in so many successful novels that of course, film adaptations became the next step, resulting in many different versions of the stories made since the first British film serial in 1923. Many talented actors like Harry Agar Lyons, Warner Oland and Christopher Lee have played the famous criminal, but the most famous interpretation of Fu Manchu is definitely the one done by horror legend Boris Karloff in the 1932 film, \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\".Based on Rohmer's story of the same name, \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" is the story of the discovery of Ghengis Khan's tomb, where his legendary Mask and Sword are supposed to be hidden. British archaeologist Sir Lionel Barton (Lawrence Grant) has discovered the exact location, but he is kidnapped by Dr. Fu Manchu's (Boris Karloff) criminal gang, in order to proclaim himself Kahn's heir and lead the Asian nations to a war against the British empire. Knowing this, Sir Nayland Smith (Lewis Stone) takes his own group of archaeologists and, along with Barton's only daughter Sheila (Karen Morley) and her fianc\u00e9e Terry (Charles Starrett), attempt to find Kahn's tomb before Fu Manchu, hoping to rescue Sir Lionel Barton in the process. However, Dr. Fu Manchu and his daughter Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy) will prove to be terrible enemies for the British agent and his team.Written by the prolific writer Edgar Allan Woolf (with Irene Kuhn and John Willard as collaborators), the film is as faithful as possible to its pulp novel origins, keeping the essence of the Rohmer's series of books in both style and substance. As in the novels, the story flows at a fast pace, mixing horror and science fiction as the adventurers must face the criminal mastermind, who here is presented as a fascinating and very powerful adversary of Smith and his team. In fact, it could be said that the writers seemed more interested in the villains than in the heroes, as Fu Manchu and his daughter are easily the most developed characters. The treatment of Fah Lo See is really interesting, as the script (written in the years before the Hays Code) allows her to be a very sexual predator, and as wicked as her father.\"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" was directed by Charles Brabin, a very experienced director of silents who after the introduction of sound, directed several \"talkies\" before retiring. Brabin's experience in Silent films may be the reason behind the very visual flare of the movie, as he gives an amazing use to Tony Gaudio's cinematography to create one of the most stunningly looking pieces of science fiction of the 30s, truly capturing the \"feeling\" of the pulp novels where the story had its origins. As the writers, Brabin seems to fall in love with his villains, and injects them the haunting mix of sadistic eroticism that previous incarnations of Fu Manchu lacked. Interestingly, this movie, Brabin's 8th film with sound, was also the first \"talkie\" directed by Charles Vidor, who here received his first chance as an assistant in a big studio movie.As written above, it's the villains what make \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" special, and fortunately, the cast portraying them was the most perfect one for the job. Myrna Loy is simply gorgeous as Fah Lo See, and while her role doesn't have too much screen time, she makes every scene memorable as Manchu's daughter. Legendary horror icon Boris Karloff makes wonders in the role of Fu Manchu, as he takes the character of the evil genius to higher levels of monstrosity. While the make-up (by Cecil Holland) is not as effective as the ones by Jack Pierce at Universal, Karloff manages to be a very convincing Fu Manchu in probably the best representation of the character. As Fu Machu's nemesis, Lewis Stone shows the necessary dignity and wit of the British gentleman he is portraying, but sadly his screen time is very limited and instead we get more of the mediocre performances by Karen Morley and Charles Starrett, who look very weak as the romantic couple.It seems like time hasn't been nice to this film when compared to other films inspired by pulp novels, and not only because of it's constant racism towards the Asians (like with the novels, the \"Yellow Peril\" stereotype is quite notorious), but mainly because it uses devises so typical of adventure films today, that it make the film look dated and clich\u00e9d; however, taking into account the times when this movie was made, one can see it as the possible source of those clich\u00e9s. On a different subject matter, the movie indeed suffers from the bad performances of those put on the main spotlight, as like many directors that started in silent films, Brabin struggles with the most dialog-based scenes. Still, Karloff, Loy and Stone shine despite Brabin's own problems and the lack of talent of the two lead actors.True, \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" looks campy and terribly dated by today standards, but it certainly has many characteristics that make it worthy of the title of \"classic\". It's horror elements are few, but it's an enormously influential film for the action and adventure genres (an influence that can be traced even to the \"Indiana Jones\" series). While not exactly a perfect movie, \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" delivers a nice pack of thrills and fun, and one of Karloff's finest performances. 7/10", "The Mask of Fu Manchu easily could have served as inspiration for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Archaeologists dashing to retrieve relic to save Western Civilization. Feats of derring-do. Scenes of despicable torture and heroic bravery. What makes this movie even better is in Raiders you know Dr. Jones will win. The Nazis are mere obstacles in his path to run over. But in this movie, Boris Karloff's performance as the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu makes the Nazis seem like mere shadows of a threat compared to his evil genius. His Fu Manchu is a villain you not only fear, but respect. Myrna Loy as his daughter is wickedly good. While the sparks put off by Fu Manchu's diabolical invention are impressive special effects, they are nothing in comparison to the sparks emitted by the young, scantily clad Myrna Loy.", "Wonderfully inventive exotic horror movie from the early days of talkies.An expedition from the British Museum sets out to find the long searched for tomb of legendary warlord Genghis Khan and get to the fabled sword and mask before it is found and usurped by Dr. Fu Manchu, evil contemporary warlord with an unquenchable ambition to extinguish the white race in his lust for power.'Mask of Fu Manchu' is well worth a watch for its stunning look alone. The sets by Cedric Gibbons are gorgeous to look at, a uniquely Hollywoodian blend of art-deco and tasteful Orientalism, photographed to fantastic effect by Tony Gaudio and evocatively lit. The acting is top-notch with Karloff an exquisitely seductive Fu Manchu and the young Loy a delight as his sadistic daughter. This film could not have been made just a couple of years later, it is decidedly pre-Code in its sexual frankness and the lusty demeanor of the characters. Ex-football star Starrett is more than sufficiently hunky stripped down to a loincloth in a torture scene! But then, the torture of this movie is always a naughty delight, it has so many things in store for us.Obviously, the question with 'Mask of Fu Manchu' as with others of its time is, Are you able to forgive its naive racism? \"You hideous yellow monster!\", our heroine hisses contemptuously, but then again, the Brits aren't exactly angels either, the barbaric way these so-called scientists go about breaking open Genghis Khan's tomb, desecrating everything on their way, only barely concealing their avarice ...A really good film, highly recommended.7/10", "No self-respecting fan of the great Boris Karloff should miss his juicy performance in this raunchy and very unconventional film. As the evil and maniacal Asian mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu, Karloff plans to kill off \"the white race\" as he hunts down the highly desirable mask and sword of Genghis Khan, which winds up in the possession of a group of British treasure seekers. Boris seems to really relish his part as he tortures his captives with a grinning sadistic glee. Myrna Loy plays his self-described \"ugly and insignificant daughter\", who harbors a sado-masochistic appetite and nymphomania.The sets are glorious, some sequences are disturbing for the time they were made, and there is newly restored controversial dialogue in the recent editions of the film, with \"politically incorrect\" slang being used on both sides of the line. There is sometimes a criticism toward the movie for its usage of this type of speech, but the time in which the feature was produced should be historically considered, as well as fairly noting that no race is spared during the length of the film. While Fu Manchu is referred to as a \"yellow devil\" by his victims, for instance, he is also denouncing Christianity and roaring with contempt to his eastern followers with his authoritative command for them to \"kill the white men and take their women!\"There are also some unintentional laughs to be found on occasion, and many of them come courtesy of Karen Morley as \"Shelia\", who is just atrocious with her comedic overacting. Running a scant 68 minutes, this is a wild and wacky good time for fans of old movies, serials, and Boris Karloff in particular. Enjoy! *** out of ****", "Dr. Fu Manchu(Boris Karloff) is a ruthless oriental who desires to obtain the ceremonial mask and sword of Genghis Khan. He believes if he secures these two sacred items, his leadership over the hordes of Asia will exterminate the white race so that he will rule the world. Professor Von Berg  (Jean Hersholt, radio veteran of \"Poems That Touch the Heart\") and Nayland Smith(Lewis Stone) of Scotland Yard try to prevent Fu Manchu from getting these important relics. These members are subject to murder and torture and are even sentenced to death in the crocodile pit.  Fah Lo See(Myrna Loy,wife of Wm. Powell in the \"Thin Man Series\")is a very sexual daughter of Fu Manchu who wants to make a young expedition member Terry Granville(Charles Starrett) to be her slave for life. Boris Karloff spoke for the first time in his second career in this film after \" Frankenstein\". Sax Rohmer who wrote the novel wanted Karloff because of his natural lisp to make it sound like a snake-like hissing in his hateful role as Fu Manchu. It is a must see film and a great film classic for all generations.", "THE MASK OF FU MANCHU has recently had several minutes of missing material restored to it, footage that has not been seen in decades. This longer cut of the film is currently enjoying a limited theatrical release, and it would be nice to see that followed by a DVD release. Probably one of the best of the films to be based on author Sax Rohmer's stories (along with FACE OF FU MANCHU and DRUMS OF FU MANCHU), it would be nice to see a potential DVD release possibly include commentary by Boris Karloff's daughter, Sara, or a look at the making of the film. Karloff commented in interviews that MASK was a troubled production, with constant changes to the script throughout the filming. In spite of that, the final film manages to capture the feel of the pulp tales that inspired it.", "The Mask of Fu Manchu is not perfect. The dialogue does feel corny to me, Karen Morley overacts dreadfully that it was difficult to take her hysteria seriously and Lewis Stone makes a piece of wood more animated. However, the black and white cinematography does show crispness and atmosphere and the sets and costumes are beautiful. The score is haunting and while occasionally silly the story is fun and never felt dull. The tortures were both scary and amusing, and I got some entertainment from the scene with the crocodiles. While Charles Starrett is not the most convincing of actors he does make up for it by his sexiness. The two best performances come from Myrna Loy and especially Boris Karloff. Loy is lustful and incredibly magnetic, while Karloff seems to be having the time of his life.All in all, The Mask of Fu Manchu is a flawed film but it is a decent and fun one. 7/10 Bethany Cox", "Amazing Sets and Bizarre Costumes and Props propel this undeniably Visual sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of a Film into a Class all its own.The three times Doctor is Diabolical, Demented and uses unspeakable means of Menacing rarely seen on the Screen.

His partner Sir Lionel Barton(Lawrence Grant)was kidnapped by Fu Manchu, wishing to learn the whereabouts of the sword and mask. Barton's daughter Sheila(Karen Morley, emulating Fay Wray type melodramatics)will insist on joining her future-husband Terrence(Charles Starrett)and Smith to an archaeological dig hoping to get Lionel back as well. But, Fu Manchu, and his evil daughter Fah Lo See(Myrna Loy)have a bevy of tricks in store for them.I highly recommend this film to Karloff fans because he squeezes every ounce of malevolence and menace from the Fu Manchu character . I LOVE the scene where he torments Lionel as they torture him with the bell, offering him food and water if he will give them the information he seeks. Giving him a taste of saltwater after hours of grueling bell sounds ringing in his ears, Lionel will not give in with Fu Manchu splashing the water in his face..while also enjoying the control at his disposal. This diabolical character allows Karloff the opportunity to sneer and grin at the power he has, with this army of manipulated Chinese willing to serve in every way, and created devices for which to humiliate and harm his foes. Myrna Loy has a juicy part in Fah Lo See, where she gets to giggle and whip Terrence when he is caught and at their mercy. I also enjoyed the numerous death devices our heroes are up against. There's this really neat invention Fu Manchu uses to test the authenticity of the Genghis Khan sword using electronic bolts. But, the real fun is watching Karloff and Loy in such nasty roles living it up as our stalwart heroes must outwit and evade Fu Manchu and his chamber of horrors.But, I could understand how many might find this offensive, \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" really is a product of it's time.", "Somewhere in the East, somewhere hidden deep in the East lies the grave of Ghengis Khan. Buried with him is his powerful sword and mask which have the ability to let the East rule over the world. A group of British scientists have finally found the grave and want to take the treasures from it to the British museum. But, Fu Manshu is watching them. This evil doctor and his diabolical daughter finally see their chance to conquer the stuff of Ghengis Khan and rule over the world. They kidnap the British leader of the expedition and are prepared to torture him to death, if only they get their hands on the sword and mask. The daughter of the professor and her boyfriend ( also a scientist ) do whatever they can to save him but Fu Manshu is too powerful. And when Fah Lo See ( Fu Manshu's daughter) shows deep interest of Terry ( the daughter's boyfriend ) chances to survive are becoming even smaller for the British scientistsI like to think the genre of horror is like good wine...how older it gets, the better. So, you can imagine how GREAT this film is. Although made in 1932, I must say I've rarely seen a film with so much creativity and originality. The story to begin with...it's fantastic and the format will be repeated many many times after this. The macabre atmosphere hanging around this movie is terrific. Dr. Fu Manshu is pure evil and the methods he uses to reach his target are unbelievable. Like the scene where he brews a special liquid to let people obey him...magical. Also, the methods of torturing used in this film are the greatest I've ever seen. I bow my head with respect for the fact these, rather shocking, images were used in a 1932 film. And then there's ...BORIS KARLOFF. In my humble opinion the greatest actor who ever lived. An honor he surely deserves when watching this movie. His appearance, body language and expressions fit perfectly. Just like he BECAME Frankenstein's monster, he now BECOMES Dr. Fu Manshu. And while the Monster of Frankenstein was actually a depressed creature who only wanted some attention...Fu Manshu is a really horrible person. He only has one vision...rule the world. Whatever it takes. The character is supposed to be evil in its purest form and Karloff plays this really difficult role flawless. A must see film that comes with my highest recommendations...Also made during the 60's starring Christopher Lee as the diabolical doctor. (the second best actor that ever lived...and still lives)10/10 ... move your butt and search this film !", "Sax Rohmer's cruel criminal mastermind Fu Manchu is the personification of the West's fear of oriental races rising up against the white man in their quest for world domination: the 'yellow peril' incarnate in one man. A Fu Manchu movie made in the early '30s, when xenophobia against the Chinese was still rife, was never going to be anything but offensive and demeaning to Asians, especially with the titular character played by Boris Karloff in 'yellow face'. And let's not go into the fact that Fu Manchu's slaves are all bald black men in loin-cloths...Karloff's Fu Manchu is certainly a despicable fellow, but I was surprised at how much opportunity this criminal genius allowed for his enemies to escape his fiendish death-traps. Like Austin Powers vs sharks with laser beams on their heads, the heroes' means of execution are ridiculously convoluted, giving the victims plenty of time to escape or be rescued. I understand that drawing out the seemingly inevitable is intended to be more cruel than simply chopping off their heads, but it would definitely allow less margin for error.This time around, the evil Chinaman is trying to get his hands on the legendary scimitar and death mask of Genghis Khan, so that he can declare himself Genghis come to life and lead his followers to victory. Scotland Yard's finest, Nayland Smith (Lewis Stone), and a team of archaeologists try to find Khan's tomb before Fu Manchu, in a plot that is strikingly similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Sadly, The Mask of Fu Manchu isn't quite as action-packed as Raiders - in fact, it's quite dreary and tedious for much of the time - but the overall pulpy vibe and some wonderful set design just about make it worthwhile (the villain's mad scientist laboratory and a huge spiral staircase are very impressive).The film wraps things up in an ending that also bears remarkable similarity to the first Indiana Jones movie: the good guys blast Fu Manchu's army with an electricity ray, the streams of deadly energy passing between men just like God's rays from the Ark that zap those nasty Nazis.4.5/10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb. Not as bad as the later Christopher Lee Fu Manchu films, but still not great.", "Englishmen race to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan. They have to get there fast, as the evil genius Dr. Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) is also searching, and if he gets the mysteriously powerful relics, he and his diabolical daughter (Myrna Loy) will enslave the world!Interestingly, this film parallels \"The Mummy\" (another Karloff film from rival Universal that came out the same year) with its reference to the curse of King Tut's tomb. An intentional jab?Most reviews focus on the inherent racism of talking about \"Eastern races\", and using a villain who needed so much makeup to look Asian that he no longer even looked human. These are fair criticisms.But although it is easy today to see the racism in the film, what is more interesting is how it was pointed out at the time. The Chinese embassy was specifically upset, and did not appreciate Fu Manchu's orders to \"Kill the white man and take his women!\"If we ignore the racial factor (and it may be hard), the film is actually quite good, with a dastardly villain who schemes and tortures. Replace Fu manchi with, say, a Nazi, and this could be looked back on as a brilliant horror mystery.", "\"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" was MGMs attempt to cash in on the horror craze of the day. They even went so far as to secure the services of the biggest horror star, Boris Karloff from Universal. Evendently, Irving Thalberg the head of production at MGM thought the studio could make them \"bigger and better\". MGM had released \"Freaks\" earlier the same year, about a group of circus freaks, but it didn't do well at the box office. So this time they decided to go with a major horror star.Dr. Fu Manchu (Karloff) a half mad and sadistic oriental leader hopes to become the new Genghis Khan by recovering Khan's mask and sword from his tomb. He then plans to unite all orientals and eliminate the white race. Also after the treasure are Sir Lionel Barton (Lawrence Grant) and his expedition which includes his daughter Sheila (Karen Morley), Professor Von Berg (Jean Hersholt), Terrence Granville (Charles Starrett), McLeod (David Torrence) and Scotland Yard detective Nayland Smith (Lewis Stone) along to protect the treasure from falling into the hands of Fu Manchu.Fu Manchu abducts Barton and tries to get him to reveal the location of Genghis Khan's sword and mask. When he refuses, Fu Manchu subjects him to the \"bell torture\". To free Barton, the party agrees to send Terrence to Fu Manchu with fake artifacts. Fu Manchu's equally evil daughter Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy) sets her sights on Terrence.After subjecting him to a lashing, Fu Manchu injects Terrence with a serum that will compel him to do Fu Manchu's bidding. Terrance returns to Sheila and under Fu Manchu's influence tricks the others into coming back to Fu Manchu with the real treasure.When the tyrant finally gets his hands on the the sword and mask, he has no further use with the explorers. First he plans to offer Sheila up as a sacrifice to the gods, subject Smith to a slow descent into an alligator pit, Professor Von Berg to impalement by a two sided wall of spikes while retaining Terrence \"for the amusement\" of his daughter.This film benefited greatly from MGMs excellent production values. The set pieces including the various instruments of torture, are excellent. Being filmed before The Production Code was implemented in Hollywood in 1934, this film contains several racial remarks and sexual innuendos. Its no secret what the seductive Foh Lo See is up to.As was usual in Hollywood, the lead oriental parts were cast with Caucasians, and the so-called Britishers with Americans using phony accents, if in fact they used them at all.Karloff seems to relish his part being as mean and evil as he ever was. Watch the \"bell torture\" sequence as an example. Loy was never sexier and probably never got the chance to play such a role again. Stone, an MGM mainstay, is also good as Fu Manchu's main adversary.Charles Starrett would go on to be Columbia's main \"B\" western hero in a contract that ran from 1935 to 1952. For the latter years he was better known as \"The Durango Kid\".One of MGM's better forays into the horror genre.", "This is a highly entertaining film, filled with plenty of action and adventure and even torture. Boris Karloff dons monster makeup once again for his role as the fiendish Fu Manchu. He doesn't even attempt an accent - unlike Christopher Lee in his Fu Manchu films - but overall his villain is far colder, and more sneering. Karloff plays it for all he's worth, creating another memorable movie monster to his impressive collection.For those who think '30s films are boring, think again. There are some excellent ingredients in this film, mainly in the form of Manchu's torture equipment. One man is lowered into a pit of crocodiles, another is hung up and whipped, while yet another is tied underneath a gigantic bell which is then made to ring constantly (a variation on water torture). He then gets his hand cut off and the severed body part is unceremoniously thrown into his daughter's residence! There's also some spikes which threaten to impale a sweating doctor. One man gets drugged and becomes a mindless zombie. Another highlight is where an assassin chucks a knife at somebody through a window, it hits them in the back, then they stagger round and shoot the killer off his rope!Events heat up for the finale full of outlandish plot twists and violence. The camera cuts just as the ending hits, leaving us with a violent impression, although cleverly nothing is shown. The film is fast paced, dispensing with dialogue in favour of intrigue and action. Ignore the racist undertones (\"you yellow fiend!\") and you'll discover this as an excellent slice of early adventure. It's also superior to any of the Christopher Lee/Fu Manchu film that were made in the 1960s, apart from perhaps the first one, THE FACE OF FU MANCHU. If you're looking for a good time, check it out!", "***SPOILERS*** In an effort to prevent the evil and sinister Dr. Fu Manchu, Boris Karloff, from getting his hands on and into Genghis Khan's hidden tomb the British Government sends Sir Lionel Barton, Lawrance Grant, on a secret mission to Mongolia. Sir Lionel is to both find Ganghis Khan's tomb and at the same time keep it from Fu Manchu's grasp.The half English, his father was the British Sir William Clayton, Fu Manchu has his hoods kidnap Sir Lionel and take him to his hideout in the Gobi Desert. It's there where he's tortured in order to reveal where Genghis Khan's tomb, together with his mask and sword, is hidden.The British Government send out an expedition team headed by world renowned geologist Sir. Danis Nayland Smith, Lewis Stone,that includes Sir' Lionel's daughter Sheila, Karen Morley, to both rescue Sir. Lionel and find Genghis Kahn's tomb. Smith in fact discover the tomb before Sir. Lionel can be tortured into revealing its whereabouts to Fu Manchu. This has the now crazed Oriental have Sir. Lionel murdered and left outside the house where Smith and a shocked and terrified Sheila can find him.Before Sir. Lionel's body was discovered Sheila's boyfriend and Smith's partner in the expedition Terry Grandville, Charles Starrett, went to make a deal with Fu Manchu in returning Genghis Khan's mask & sword for Sir Lionel's life. Taken prisoner by Fu Manchu's thugs the crazed Doctor really freaks out when he finds out that the sword, were not that sure about the mask, is a fake!Terry having his life speared not only because Fu Manchu's sex starved daughter Fah Lo See, Myrna Loy, took a shine to the handsome but hated and despised young white man but that Fu Manchu has bigger plans for him. Terry is allowed, after being turned into a mindless Zombie, to go back to camp to retrieve the real things, the sword and mask, for Doctor Fu Manchu.The movie \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" is very out in front and in the open with its theory of what at the time was known as the \"Yellow Peril\" from the East. Even though Doctor Fu Manchu was half Oriental and educated in Europe and America his roots were still deeply embedded in the Oriental culture and history. Fu Manchu's attempt to get hold of Genghis Khan's power and legacy as the greatest Oriental conquerer off all time , through his mask and sword, was to finish the job that the great Khan started some 700 years ago: The brutal conquest of the both Christian and Islamic West.The movie's racism can be easily overlooked in that it was made at a time,1932, when it-racism-was not even considered a dirty word and in fact was not found in many, if any at all, of the English dictionaries of that time. Also the racism in the film was an equal opportunity employer in that it insulted not only Orientals but Europeans as well. Not that the film intensionally made the European, or white, explores good guys at the expense of the Chinese and Mongolians but in fact made them look unintentionally ridicules, in retrospect, in their narrow minded and unfounded opinion's about them.", "Once you get past a knighted member of the British Secret Service (Lewis Stone) doesn't have a British accent, but Fu Manchu does. Another knighted Brit (Lawrence Grant) does have a British accent but his daughter (Karen Morely) does not. Somehow, Fu Manchu has people hiding in sarcophagi dressed as mummies in the British Museum, plus one guy who appears to be wearing a beret inside a sarcophagus, but disappears. Once you overlook all this, and a few other things, such as the British finding Genghis Khan's tomb in about the same amount of time that Sir Lionel Barton is kept under a constantly ringing bell, this is actually pretty entertaining.You have Karloff as Fu Manchu who has all these elaborate methods of torture and killing people, and like in the Bond films, people tend to escape before dying. At one point, Karloff looks a bit like Carmen Miranda at the Carnival in Rio. Myrna Loy, as others have commented, seems to be a sadistic nymphomaniac, which for some people, is quite possibly the perfect mate.Overlook all of the things that don't make a lot of sense and just enjoy!", "This isn't exactly the deepest or most politically correct film, but it sure is silly old-fashioned fun. This is a prime example of a Saturday morning B-type movie, though its production values are a little better than average, since it's made by a larger studio.The first thing you will probably notice when you see the movie is that many of the Chinese in this movie, and ALL of the main actors, are Caucasians--so, those who have strong \"politically correct\" tendencies, you MIGHT want to find a different picture to watch. I agree that it's sad to see people such as Boris Karloff and Myrna Loy playing Chinese people in this film, but unfortunately, it WAS the norm for this era. Apart from Keye Luke playing \"#1 son\" in CHARLIE CHAN pictures, Chinese people rarely played lead actors. Such ridiculous celebrities as Katherine Hepburn(!!!), Walter Huston, Sidney Toler, Louise Ranier and Paul Muni played Chinese people--and did so VERY unconvincingly.Now, apart from all this, the movie is pretty good, though not great. Despite having Boris Karloff, this really isn't a horror film and is a pretty much average performance from him. However, this still IS a good thing as his movies almost always are entertaining fun and this film is no exception.", "Somewhere beneath the sands of the Gobi Desert lies the Orient's greatest treasure - the grave & relics of Genghis Khan. Ancient legend says that whoever possesses his sword, scepter & mask will lead the East in the conquest of the world. The insidious Dr. Fu Manchu, Asia's most evil criminal genius, does not know the location of the hoard, but he knows how to set a cunning trap to lure specialists from the British Museum who do know the secret. With his wicked daughter by his side, he plans to stop at nothing in his quest for world domination, once Genghis' mask becomes THE MASK OF FU MANCHU.MGM made few horror films in the 1930's, but that handful tended to be rather special. For this film the Studio was able to get the services of Hollywood's most famous monster, Boris Karloff. Mr. Karloff, who personally was a very gentle soul, is marvelously nasty as Fu Manchu - the thrice-times Ph.D. & gentlemanly torturer. And what delightful tortures they are: Dr. Fu's guests are likely to be injected with tarantula serum, slowly tilted into an alligator pond, or impaled upon steel spikes. Myrna Loy, most effective as his sadistic offspring, enjoys having visitors whipped.Lewis Stone as a Scotland Yard inspector & Jean Hersholt as an archeologist both give the expected fine performance. Charles Starrett, as the much-abused young hero, & Karen Morley, as the requisite young woman on a dangerous expedition, both give a good account of themselves. Film mavens should look for uncredited bits by Ferdinand Gottschalk, as a British Museum official & Willie Fung, as a ship's steward.", "Did Anglos really have so much contempt for the Chinese back in 1932? Wow! This movie portrays all Asians as evil, dangerous, moral-free individuals with reptilian brains and a yen for white women. And, to cap it all off, Fu Manchu and his daughter are played by white actors.But, they came by it honestly: The series of books by Sax Rohmer did not exactly sing the praises of those from the far east. And, when it comes to unbridled sadism, who is better than Boris Karloff? And, when it comes to the flower of Asian womanhood, who is more appropriate than Myrna Loy? This movie plays well as an exciting serial if one doesn't think too hard about any of the dialog...", "MGM, which issued this comic book of a movie, made it easy for viewers to figure out that its movies were exotic. The men always wore white suits and pith helmets. When it was REALLY exotic, they wore pistols and boots too.Lewis Stone is Sir Nayland Smith who leads an expedition into deepest Mongolia to unearth the hidden burial place of Genghis Khan and steal his sword and his mask. There is a certain urgency attached to the task. The notorious arch-fiend Dr. Fu Manchu wants to beat them to it and raise all Asia against the West, and he has spies everywhere. They're even hidden in the British Museum disguised as mummies. I'm afraid I had to call him \"doctor\" because he insisted on it in the movie. He has -- let me think -- a PhD from Edinburgh, a JD from Pace, and an MD from Harvard. In none of these places did they teach him to trim his fingernails.The story is too complicated to spell out here, and besides I nodded out for a few minutes somewhere around the point at which the white folks are captured and the hysterical blond babe is spread out on the altar in a flowing dress of virginal white and Dr. Fu is poised above her, prepared to baptize the sword of Genghis Khan in her blood, just before he and the horde of Yellow Perils is wiped out by the death ray gun that the muscular hero has stolen and is now wielding from a hole in the ceiling and then -- then -- yes, that's where I nodded out. One of the duller moments.I don't know. Some people find this sort of vulgar trash thrilling, but I found it boring. Granted, it was never intended to be more than a comic book of a movie but I quit reading comic books when I was a kid. (We called them \"funnybooks\".) We used to buy them and then trade with each other. I remember Wayne Bigg tried to cheat me once by inserting one comic book into the pages of another. The swine. I wonder what became of Wayne Bigg. Probably in jail.It's not a BAD movie, not bad enough to be amusing in itself. It's exactly what it set out to be. If you can vibrate with joy at the sight of Boris Karloff in outrageous Mandarin make up, his features lighted from below, sneering racist agitprop, then this is your kind of movie.Maybe we owe it to ourselves anyway to see this compounded Saturday afternoon serial. The name of Fu Manchu has become part of our vernacular lexicon. I mean Dr. Fu Manchu of course.", "Back at M-G-M, after a loan-out to RKO, Myrna Loy was cast as the daughter of Fu Manchu when, to everyone's surprise, Louis B. Mayer outbid Paramount for the rights to Sax Rohmer's 1932 novel, \"The Mask of Fu Manchu\".Determined to cash in on the book's success, the studio spent more money on this fourth entry in the series than Paramount had expended on the combined total of the first three. Warner Oland was replaced by Boris Karloff, while Myrna Loy took over from Anna May Wong, and Lewis Stone substituted for O.P. Heggie's Nayland Smith.Unfortunately, neither audiences nor censors responded to the movie's outrageously tongue-in-cheek approach. Failing to recover anything like its huge production cost, this spectacular failure put paid to Fu Manchu until Henry Brandon surfaced as a weak imitation in the 1940 Republic serial, \"Drums of Fu Manchu\"; and a whole quarter century after that, Christopher Lee successfully revived the sinister doctor in Don Sharp's stylish \"The Face of Fu Manchu\".\"The Mask of Fu Manchu\" is available, would you believe, not on an M-G-M DVD, but on a 10/10 Warner DVD.", "The Mask of Fu Manchu is a bit campy, but if you've got a theme planned for Halloween of old horror movies, you might want to add it to the list alongside some other Boris Karloff classics. Boris stars, in heavy makeup, as Dr. Fu Manchu, who's on the lookout for Genghis Khan's lost treasure. His minions will do anything to find it, including steal it off of museum curators who tried to find it legitimately.Lewis Stone is the head of the good guys, or if you're looking at it another way, the opposition team. Lawrence Grant, Jean Hersholt, and Charles Starrett try to find the treasure, but along the way, Lawrence gets kidnapped and held ransom. His daughter, Karen Morley, who's in love with Charles, gets involved in the adventure, and all three of the remaining try to rescue Lawrence and maintain the treasure.Myrna Loy, in her early days, costars as Boris's daughter, and she's quite the villainess who enjoys power and violence. This one's not as scary as Frankenstein, but it's fun if that's your theme for the weekend. Where else will you be able to find Lewis Stone fighting his way through a pit of alligators, or Jean Hersholt strapped to a chair while giant spikes close in all around him? That's some pretty scary stuff for the soon-to-be Judge Hardy and Heidi's Grandfather!"], "tt0023235": ["I remember this movie from seeing it on a kids' matin\u00e9e at Peoples, a neighborhood theater in Dayton, Ohio, in 1933 or '34, when I was 9 years old. It was so scary that the memory has stuck with me for some 71 years.I could not summarize the plot in any great detail; nor would I want to, since it would be a forbidden spoiler in case the film should ever turn up on the cable or elsewhere.The story is set in a small European village -- in Transylvania, or some such place. It seems that it was always raining, with lightning and thunder, and people coming in wet and cold, and that most of the action took place at night -- a real film noir!Mr. and Mrs. White somehow acquired a mummified hand or paw of a small monkey, perhaps from a stranger who came in from the cold. The paw was said to have magical or supernatural powers, endowing the owners with the privilege of making THREE wishes. (It's always three, isn't it?)After a little discussion, Mrs. White convinced her husband to wish for a great deal of money, since the Whites were of modest means. White nervously held the paw in his hand and spoke the wish for money. At that instant, naturally, there was a blinding flash of lightning close by with an immediate crash of thunder! The dead hand of the monkey contracted into a fist momentarily, then returned to its curved-fingers relaxed position. I saw this clearly on the screen, but I'm not sure the characters in the movie saw it. In any case, nothing happened, and the Whites, and the others who were in the house laughed it off.In a day or so, however, the Whites received word that they were to receive a large sum of money from an insurance settlement. That was the good news. The trouble was the event that caused the big payoff ... . You didn't think they'd get money for free, did you?Well, as it turned out -- and as you'd no doubt guess -- the other two wishes were used up in a desperate attempt to recover from the disaster produced by the first. It was all tied up with ghostly illusions and thunder and lightning and rain and floods, and all kinds of troubles that scared the socks off the kids in the movie house. At least it did me.After all these years, I have a very warm feeling about this movie. I believe it was a first rate horror film, though definitely a low budget, \"B-movie\" filler to kill time before they showed the cowboy movie that we had really paid our dime to see. I feel that my recollections of it are vivid enough and accurate enough to justify my entering a favorable vote for it in the Data Base. I wish a print of it were available somewhere so the cable people could show it to us.", "It's kind of hard to believe that in 2017, we can still find a few of the missing stragglers from the early days of Hollywood. This one always baffled me as to how it could be lost as it was made by Cooper and Schoedsack at RKO the same year they released their landmark, KING KONG. This monkey was dwarfed and it is very much a minor B-film. Unfortunately, too, this version of THE MONKEY'S PAW that exists is dubbed in French and is only 49 minutes long - it lists as originally being 58 minutes. I'll explain a bit of that in the end (AND YES, EVEN FOR A LOST FILM I'M GIVING YOU A SPOILER ALERT).To not be able to hear C. Aubrey Smith's thick British droll is a big loss. He dominates the first half of the film and hearing him dubbed in French is tough to take. A similar feeling transpires when missing Bramwell Fletcher's excellent diction and Ivan Simpson's humble voice. The film is well-cast. Simpson is perfect for the somewhat pathetic John White. I had the fortune of an English language script to follow the dialogue. If you are familiar with the story, though, as I would think many horror fans are, then you can follow along for the most part without a script.There is no musical score in the film. If there was one then it went away with the English dialogue. The sound effects are very good - lots of wind and creaking of wood that you would expect from this kind of horror tale. I was under the impression there would be shots of the paw moving (special effects), but in this copy of the film there is only one shot of the paw moving and it is very unimpressive. The direction is adequate. Most of all, the film does have a feeling of being uneven. The story goes that the portion of the film that focuses on the White family was shot by Wesley Ruggles and came in at just over a half hour in length. To compensate for this and pad the film's length, the prologue with C. Aubrey Smith's character, Tom, and how he came to own the paw was shot afterwards by Ernest Schoedsack. I have to say, I enjoyed very much the prologue which takes place in India. It adds to the viewers' belief that the paw is tragically cursed as we see what happens to a poor Indian woman who dies horribly for her wishes. Tom, then makes a similar poor judgment in his use of the paw which leads him to come back to London and tell this tale to the Whites.The thing that will interest most people who are familiar with this film is the ending. The original version that was shown in the US in 1933 had a happy ending. It turned out that the whole story was a dream and Herbert White (John's son) and Rose get to live happily ever after. In this French version, the film ends with Mr. and Mrs. White having used their final wish to send their son back to his grave in peace. This, to readers of the short story, is the scene most people remember. It is not filmed well as the action takes place all in one long shot. As John wishes his son back to his grave, he is in the background of the shot while his wife frantically tries to open the door to let her dead son in. More cutting and closer shots would have benefited the film, but again, this clearly has the hallmarks of being a minor B picture.There is very little storytelling flair in terms of camera-work and editing, but there are ample shadows and dark atmosphere. The suspense doesn't build up as you would hope, though. I'm confident that seeing it and hearing the English actors' voices would help, because it is hard to read a script and look up at the TV screen for 49 minutes. So, the filmmakers' original work is still in many ways, lost. After all, it is a privilege to see THE MONKEY'S PAW as it just as easily could have gone unseen forever. There is a rumor of an English language version being discovered and if this is true, I think this film would be much more enjoyable. It begs the question, though as to what the best ending could be - a dream or reality?", "W W Jacobs was a well known & popular English short story writer of the 1930s - usually sea tales with mystery and The Monkey's Paw is about his best known and oft heard if not a great favourite with amateur dramatic groups (probably because of the small cast). It is a nice little creepy tale with a universal moral - be careful what you wish for.... it could come with a price tag! I originally heard it as a radio play and couldn't wait to read the play itself. This early film version is unknown to me although a variety of adaptations have been produced on film - in one inferior updated case(I forget the title),the paw was replaced by another gimmick. IMDb lists 8 versions including a TV production and it was also included in radio's Suspense & Lights Out! series because it is favourably compared with Lucille Fletcher's radio masterpiece Sorry Wrong No! as a classic of the short story and radio adaptation when only one's imagination can do justice to the imagery & action. The original background was a typical working class English home of the '30s - the rest of the background is just referred to. For once the premise is too possible! 8 out of 10 for the story."], "tt0023236": ["\"The Monster Walks\" is a very old and very cheap haunted-house mystery thriller without much mystery. Yet, considering the budget and the experience cast & crew members disposed of, this probably isn't such a bad movie after all. I'm sure that fans of early horror films will definitely detect a lot of charm and goodwill in this typical story about a wealthy daughter that is targeted for murder upon returning to her parental house for the regulation of her dead father's inheritance. Ruth has always been petrified by her father's pet-ape and, although safely caged in the basement, some malicious persons uses the animal to scare her senseless. Rex Lease is her all-knowing doctor/boyfriend who investigates the strange nightly events and eventually reveals the true culprit. Maybe the plot-twists would have intrigued me more if the actual climax wasn't stupidly mentioned on the DVD-box, but I still can't say the script is very complex or effectively misleading. There are one or two decent suspense-moments but overall this is a dull and unexciting poverty row movie. All the lovely clich\u00e9s of 30's horror cinema are there, though, like the exaggeratedly polite servants, the seemly endless thunderstorm outside the castle and the black chauffeur-guy who simultaneously serves as the comic relief. This is an okay film as long as you don't expect to see another \"The Old Dark House\".", "It is surprising how many \"old dark house\" movies there were back in the early days of talking pictures.  It seems like every independent, Poverty Row studio made their fair share.  Some are actually quite good even after all these years.  I am about to talk about one of them. Stop me if you've heard this one before:  a rich, reclusive, eccentric man passes away and his relatives gather for the reading of the will.  What? You've heard this one already?  Stick with me, it gets good.  The dead mans brother (Sheldon Lewis, the Clutching Hand himself in a surprisingly subdued performance) is confined to a wheelchair and the servants (Martha Mattox, best remembered from THE CAT AND THE CANARY, 1927 and Mischa Auer later to costar in CONDEMNED TO LIVE, 1935) are the creepiest characters you ever saw.  The family attorney (Sidney Bracy) is acting mighty suspicious too. Along comes the dead man's daughter (Vera Reynolds) who seems to be the only likable member of the family.  With her comes her fiancee (Rex Lease, taking a break from westerns) and his chauffeur (Sleep n' Eat who later went back to his real name, Willie Best).  Also in the house is Yogi, a large chimp whom the doctor used for experiments. Everyone in the house gets a chance to say \"His death was so sudden!\" so right away we are ready for foul play to be mentioned.  Like all houses in this genre there are lots of secret passageways but at least this time the killer does not skulk around in a cloak and black hood.  It looks like the killer is Yogi the chimp.  Ah, but things are not always what they seem to be!  Before the 65 minute running time is over we learn about secret love affairs, children, murder plots, bribery and madness. Sadly the weakest point in the movie is the heroine herself.  It hardly takes more than a clap of thunder or a shadow to start her screaming \"Take me away from here!\" to her fiancee.  Willie Best steals many scenes with his on-the-money delivery of many great lines.  When informed that his room is in the basement near Yogi's cage he responds \"Well get me an umbrella and I'll sleep on the roof.\"  Once we know there is a killer loose in the house Willie is asked if he left his gun in the glovebox of the car and he replies \"No sir, it's right here!\" and pulls it from his pocket.  Mischa Auer is quite effective as a menacing presence but he later abandoned drama and became quite a successful comedian.  Sheldon Lewis gets much more to do in this movie than he does in THE PHANTOM (1931) where he does a retread of his old Clutching Hand character. Okay so the movie is old and the plot is nothing we have not seen before; this is still a fun movie and worth catching if you are studying early talkies or if you just want something to enjoy.", "Ever since the literary origins of the horror genre, stories about old dark houses have haunted the dreams of horror fans across the globe. Like in literature, cinema adopted this kind of stories quickly and this Gothic branch of horror was early explored by the filmmakers. Among the earliest movies of this kind in the \"sound era\", is this little known Gothic film by Frank R. Strayer starring no one else but Mischa Auer (whom years later would achieve fame and recognition as a comedian) in a creepy and very dark role.The film is about the death of a millionaire scientist, and the subsequent reading of his will. Among them are his young daughter Ruth (Vera Reynolds), his brother Robert (Sheldon Lewis) and his two servants, Mrs. Emma Turg (Martha Mattox) and her son Hanss (Mischa Auer). After the reading of the will, mysterious events begin to happen as it seems that a killer is after those more benefited by the scientist' will. This kind of plot is nowadays a clich\u00e9, but in its day it was still fresh and a favorite both among the audience and among the writers.Made just 5 years after the first sound movie, \"The Monster Walks\" is a stylistically a film that still retains some features from silent films. It is one of the first works of writer Robert Ellis (who would achieve fame writing the Charlie Chan films), more exactly, his first talkie; and sadly, it shows, as it feels too stagy for its own sake. However, Ellis' love for mystery is present and while clich\u00e9d, the plot is well developed and shows why he became a master of the genre.Strayer's direction is also a bit restrained, as if he was experimenting with the new technology. Strayer builds up his film with care and at a very slow pace, and while his lack of expertise is obvious, it's interesting to see the steps that lead to his far superior \"The Vampire Bat\" and \"The Ghost Walks\", and eventually to his highly successful \"Blondie\" series. It is also worth to point out that he gave both Mischa Auer and Willie Best one of their first opportunities in the business.The acting is a mixed bag of extremes, with some members of the cast being excellent while others give rather poor performances. Mischa Auer is without a doubt among the former and while he is more recognized as a comedian, he pulls off a role clearly inspired by Lugosi and Karloff's performances on the Universal films of 1931. Martha Mattox is equally impressive as his mother but is definitely Wilie Best (under the racist pseudonym of \"Sleep 'n' Eat\") who steals the show with his great talent for comedy. The rest of the cast is less impressive, and while Rex Lease makes a good lead, Vera Reynolds' over the top melodrama (probably another element from silent films) is a bit annoying and distracting.Like most films done on the Poverty Row, \"The Monster Walks\" suffers of a terribly low-budget and even lower production values. The old dark house scenery becomes repetitive and modern viewers may be bored by this old style of film-making. The over the top acting of some members of the cast may also be another distraction that hurts the film, but the biggest problem lays on the fact that nowadays the plot is neither original nor interesting. This last detail is definitely not the film's fault, but viewers are to be warned.\"The Monster Walks\" is not a classic, and definitely not a very good film, but it is a great chance to watch how film-making was evolving as it features the early work of four great artists of the 40s and how they learned the business. As a novelty, this film is very rewarding and a nice chance to watch non-Universal horror of the origins of film. 5/10", "This would be a decent creaky old dark house movie if it wasn't for the acting and over acting. Basically a prodigal daughter returns to her home when her father dies for the reading of the will. The servants are weird, the uncle is in a wheel chair, an abused chimp is in a cage in the basement and there are secret passages through the house. This is low budget film from the early days of sound and it seem like it. There is little background noise and no music which more times than not slows things down. Worse is the acting which seems to have been done in some odd experimental style. Misha Auer, seen in later films with a pronounced accent seems almost not to have one. His performance is very odd, especially when compared to later films. Interesting here you get to see just how big and imposing man he was. The movie is painfully slow and probably would have put me to sleep had I been just sitting and watching the film. This is not a film to recommend unless you have insomnia. Its an interesting film as a curio but isn't remarkable and the plotting is truly run of the mill. There are better ways to spend your time.", "The set-up of this movie is very simple--a bunch of people in a house, trying to be scary. Add an ape to good effect. Here's the idea: a woman and her fianc\u00e9 return to her childhood home after the death of her father, who was a scientist. Her uncle, his wife, and their son reside there as tenants and housekeepers, and they all want the money the young woman inherited. Thus, they do the usual thing a mismatched group of spurned relatives do in this situation: plan to kill her, framing the dead scientist's angry ape as the murderer. Of course, they're really bad at it, so it doesn't really work out very well.Even though this movie was very low budget and the plot was slim, it still could have been a lot better. The direction jumps from exposition to action with very little consideration for timing, which means both fall flat and ultimately the whole set-up is given away too early, ruining any chance of suspense or horror. It's also not worth it to expect good acting from these kind of productions from this era, but on the other hand, only the black man and the messed-up son seemed to have any character. Also, is it a little wrong to ask that the movie have something to do with the title?But worst (or perhaps best) of all, this movie does feature one very memorable scene: the worst attempt at murder EVER. Tell me, how does chaining a woman to a pole and whipping a monkey cage work to off the woman, especially when one is on a time limit? Wonderful b-movie absurdity leads to situations like that, which are very fascinating not only because they're poorly done, but you have to wonder who thought up the scene in the first place! --PolarisDiB", "A wealthy man dies, causing his family and lawyer to reunite in his home and have his will be read. Who will get the money? While the natural answer would be his only child, daughter Ruth (Vera Reynolds), two factors make this a bit more complicated. First, a chimpanzee that has a violent streak and a dislike for Ruth. Second, the possibility that an illegitimate child may exist and be living in the house.The actual plot of this film is not very exciting and you may have to work to keep your interest. Stories of an inheritance being fought over by family members is nothing unique, and for some reason stories with chimps and apes weren't particular rare in the first half of the 20th century. I'm not sure why -- there's nothing menacing about the ape in this picture. Nothing. There are a few plot devices I found clever (such as secret panels in the house), but overall this is child's play.The acting is also, to put it politely, subpar. The lawyer, Herbert Wilkes (Sidney Bracey), was very hackneyed. Worst of all was Hanns, the maid's son. His mannerisms were exaggerated and he had a broken speech that didn't seem natural. Another reviewer commented that he may have been reading from cue cards, and I wouldn't be shocked. Sure, this was 1932 and America was going through a depression... but couldn't we afford better talent than this? (Believe it or not, just a few years after this film, the actor who played Hanns -- Mischa Auer -- was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He didn't win.) The only thing about this film that makes it maybe worth watching -- and I stress maybe -- is Willie Best, the actor who plays Exodus the manservant. There is a strong undercurrent of racism in this film that I cannot tell if it was meant to be intentional or not. Best (credited as \"Sleep N Eat\") talks and acts like a white supremacist's vision of the stereotypical black man. He mumbles, waves a gun around (even pointing it at himself) and generally seems highly unintelligent. The most memorable part of the film is when Exodus asks about the ape and the resident doctor explains that Darwin's theory states the ape is related to Exodus (said in such a way as to imply blacks are more closely related than whites). Rather than defend himself, Exodus says something to the effect of, \"I had a grandpa that looked like that... but he wasn't as active.\" Wow.Anyone into the classic black and white films might give this one a chance. It's alright once you get into it. But unless you have a really strong attention span (and this film is only an hour) I'd suggest you try something a little more lively. It's safe to say that if this film wasn't being distributed in copyright-free box sets, it would have faded into obscurity decades ago.", "In the early 1930's, they had a series of these \"Old Dark House\" pictures, usually involving a bunch of people brought together in an old mansion as an unseen killer begins picking them off. This probably had a lot to do with the fact that early talkies were produced by people who had a lot of experience on stage, as many of the silent era directors and actors found themselves out of their depth with the introduction of sound.The film's opening graphic has a picture of half-naked woman being carried off by a ape. Of course, you see nothing like this in the film, as the primary actress never gets very naked or gets touched by an ape.The plot is simple enough. A rich man dies, leaving his entire fortune to his daughter, but her uncle is the next in line to get it if she dies. And the late millionaire had a pet ape he kept in the basement. Did the ape get out and start strangling people? Well, I'll leave you in suspense... of course not. It was old man Krug, he was the ape all along, and he'd have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids.(Actually, I think this is the second movie I've reviewed with someone in an ape suit killing people, which i guess was a pretty standard fare on Poverty Row in the 30's and 40's.)The final point is the actor credited as \"Eat N Sleep\", better known as Willie Best. He was typical of the way African-Americans were portrayed in this era, superstitious, subservient, and scared. You can't watch these kinds of scenes today without cringing.", "The Monster Walks (1932)** (out of 4)It's rather amazing at how many films would follow after The Bat was released in 1926 and kicked off the \"old dark house\" genre. This time a daughter returns to her father's house after his death so that she can hear the will being read. Everything starts off okay but soon a killer is stalking everyone with the help of a gorilla. I'm still rather curious why every \"old dark house\" from this period featured a gorilla. I'm going to guess that movie crowds back then were scared of them as I don't see why they should play such an important part in these films. Nothing really stands out in this film, although the running time is just over 60-minutes. The performances are decent but nothing special and the story itself doesn't offer enough twists to be entertaining. God knows there are far worse than this out there but then again there are much better ones. The racial humor from a servant (named Sleep 'N Eat) is off base and doesn't really help matters.", "THE MONSTER WALKS (1932)An ape is killing people in an old spooky house! This movie is sooo bad, but also a wonderful example of the 1930's \"haunted house\" films. We love the scene where a dead body is kept in a room lit only by a single candle light...Lots of gimmicky scenes that were common in those days are practiced in this atmospheric movie. Don't miss it, it's a real treasure that will have you laughing, but also calling up some great memories of the era.", "This is a great horror movie. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. 4.1 is underrating it big time. I give this 9 out of 10. It is one of the best horror movie ever.", "It was a dark and stormy night with constant cannon fire in the distance, with the wind scratching a wax record somewhere out of scene. OK the quality of the picture is not Oscar material but hey, this was 1932. At least now I know where H&B got all the gags for the Scooby Doo cartoons. As mentioned in most of the other comments this is a typical Haunted House movie, with only one or two real surprises. There is even the maniac monkey thrown in as with countless other \"horror\" movies of the era. Were chimps really that scary back then???? The acting is worthy of any community playhouse, I kept looking for the script cards Hanns was reading off of. And I was shocked to learn Hanns actually had musical talent - kinda... sorta... OK not really. But I did manage to make it through this movie in one setting without going comatose, but I did find myself quoting Vera at least once or twice during the movie, \"Oh Ted, take me away!\".", "If there was ever an award for \"worst ensemble\", this film would have won that prize for 1932. Everybody speaks as if they are reciting a dictionary filled with words they can't pronounce, as if the director was timing each of their lines to reach a certain point When the fastest speaker is \"Sleep n' Eat\" (aka Willie Best), you know that the film is moving along slower than a snail in a swamp. Had everybody spoken their lines at a normal speed, the film would have been 20 minutes shorter than its hour long running time.This \"old dark house\" movie utilizes elements already old hat in talkie horror films (an invalid patriarch, a heroine in peril, sinister servants, even a gorilla living in the basement), and you just know that a hair-covered hand is going to pop out of a wall to grab the heroine as she sleeps. A violin playing shadow will instantly make you think of Cloris Leachman in Frau Brucher in \"Young Frankenstein\".Mischa Auer can't make up his mind whether his character is a slow-witted servant or sinister red herring. He takes the wacko that Dwight Frye played in \"Dracula\" to a new level of ridiculousness. Vera Reynolds' heroine is so dull and the dialog so non-campy and the identity of the perpetrator so obvious that you will figure it all out within the first 10 minutes of the film.", "Well before 1939's \"The Gorilla\", and 1940's \"The Ape\", you had this Astor Pictures release - \"The Monster Walks\", an early treatment of the big monkey theme prior to the following year's blockbuster \"King Kong\". But to even mention the first three in the same breath (which I just did, sorry!) would be a great disservice to one of my all time favorite films. As a Poverty Row project, this one must have really had a limited budget, as the ape in question was actually a chimpanzee; though come to think of it, at least it was a live animal, and not a man in a gorilla suit. Once the chimp's name is revealed as Yogi, you know you won't be able to pin any murders on the poor old boy.The story revolves around the large inheritance left a young woman (Vera Reynolds) by her father, with the provision that if she dies, the money reverts to the dead man's brother Robert (Sheldon Lewis), crippled and confined to a wheel chair. The story line at least keeps you wondering whether Robert will eventually pop out of his chair to reveal himself as a suspect, as Ruth's fianc\u00e9e Dr. Clayton (Rex Lease) surmises. Also dissatisfied with the outcome of the will are Emma Krug (Martha Mattox) and her son Hanns (Mischa Auer). Auer's performance borrows the early Bela Lugosi forced diction and Boris Karloff's Frankenstein walk. It struck me somewhat humorously that his appearance resembles a cross between a bemused Stan Laurel and a maniacal Christopher Walken. Close your eyes and picture it.I didn't quite know what to make of the incessant drum gong throughout the film. It was as if an important new revelation was about to become known, until I eventually realized it was supposed to be thunder.As if comic relief were needed for this movie, Willie Best is on hand in a very stereotyped role as Dr. Clayton's driver. But what's up with his screen credit as 'Sleep 'n' Eat'? I'll have to research that one. I enjoyed him more as Mantan Moreland's sometimes cousin in the later Charlie Chan films.I think the movie might have been more interesting with one of the name character actors of the day, if not Lugosi or Karloff, then at least a George Zucco or Lionel Atwill. But don't let that put you off, the movie does have it's share of creepy fun and keeps you guessing with moving pictures on the wall and the gorilla hand through the bed rails. Maybe not scary enough to give you nightmares, but campy enough for an hour's worth of entertainment. Tune in when you can.", "This is a misinterpreted film, with reviewers (on another site) believing the opposite of how I understood it; another of those situations when we are likely reviewing different movies, so dissimilar are the ideas, anyway to me Mischa Auer but also Sidney Bracey are the best from the cast, each of the others being also strongly effective and acting professionally, even Lease.A horror movie with a good cast: Sheldon Lewis as the surviving brother, Sidney Bracey as Wilkes (a reliable old-school role), Mischa Auer (who not only got a good role, but also knew how to play it), Martha Mattox as his mother, W. Best (sadly reduced to a coward manservant, like in a later movie); perhaps not so good were the two leads, either bland (him), or less likable, her (which in fact means good casting, she's the offshoot of a doomed family, and she has to look spooked, but also spooky herself). But even she, is understandably scared, and shaken, and asks to leave twice, the 1st time they make her change her mind and the housekeeper keeps her company, the 2nd time she's handed over to Hanns; she doesn't ask to leave the house more than twice, and each time her request is answered: calming her, and then entrusting her to the cousin she doesn't yet know she has. The plot is mysterious and unnerving, the dialogs well written, and the casting, flawless (quite the opposite of what some reviewers affect to think). The visual style proves intelligent, unlike that of other '30s movies that look like footage for a radio play. Lease, the physician, was somewhat bland, but not unlikable, and certainly not obnoxious.Hanns is an Expressionist character, something Strayer was fond of, and the player, a '30s character actor, was highly effective as someone who's not at all a simpleton, and his bond with the elder guy is suggested by the impatient way he handles him in a scene; the plot also may remind of that feel, with its suggestions of beastliness, monstrosity, the 'Universal' horrors took over something from the European style. But the horror attempted here is different, starker; it's not an Expressionist horror, Hanns alone reminds of this style, otherwise here the terror is starker, more visceral, punching. A moving frame on the wall, hands seen in the funeral chamber, a clutching hand, a player's silhouette \u0085. Then the pulse count reveals half the solution.Strayer in the early '30s: he was a dependable director. In this tale of a doomed family, where one brother preferred his ape to his daughter, and the other one fathered a gloomy man, the doubles are significant: the caged ape is the daughter's double, but also her cousin's double.Vera R. has been chosen precisely because she looked spooky herself. In Strayer's movies, the murders are sometimes shown, in this one as well.I liked the dreary house, the sets, starkly unnerving, I enjoyed the feel, and the dialog, with some likable people, like the physician and the lawyer, behaving as they do, the lawyer made a nice gentleman, and chivalrous, so I approve of the way the characters have been thought out and played; both families, owners and servants, are German, Hanns looks and behaves the way he does, because he is the sickly brother's child, his cousin asks only twice to leave, and it's explained why she remains (as also the ape's presence in the house is amply explained; less obvious is why would Hanns use the unholy glove for his hand, but the ape is his double), and when she was going to leave, she's kidnapped. There are only few funny moments, all by W. Best.The last joke, the likeness with the ape, seems added for the half-wits, and comes after an hour with two strange German families.", "Treating this horror film as anything but camp and you will agree it's one of the worst films ever made. The acting is wooden, the writing amateurish (with leading lady, Vera Reynolds, saying to her fianc\u00e9, Rex Lease, \"Oh Ted, take me away\" at least five times, whenever something disturbing happens), and the production values poor.  As a horror film by today's standards it's totally laughable, but in 1932 it was intended to scare audiences.  You see a wall picture move, revealing a hole (gasp! someone is watching).  You see a furry arm come through the headboard and threaten an unsuspecting sleeper. And there's a caged ape in the basement that may or may not know how to get out of his cage. (He's called an ape but is obviously a chimpanzee.) Willie Best, annoying billed as \"Sleep N' Eat,\" provides the intended comedy relief and is as good as usual, but don't expect too much from anyone else.  See it with a group and you'll all have some fun.Forgetful Filmmakers Dept.: Lawyer Sidney Bracy is billed onscreen as \"Herbert Wilkes.\"  But in the will he reads, he is referred to as \"William Wilkes.\"", "The owner dies and leaves his fortune to his daughter (Vera Reynolds), but the brother (Sheldon Lewis) wants it for himself and the son (Oscar nominee Mischa Auer) he is hiding. He plans to have the son eliminate everyone so he can grab the riches.The plan goes awry when the son kills his mother (Martha Mattox) by mistake. He turns on his father and tries to kill the daughter.It was a weird little film, just out of the silent era, and there was more talking than anything.Of course, they have the stereotypical black chauffeur (Willie Best, who was listed in the credits as Sleep 'n' Eat). I kid you not! I last remember Best from High Sierra. He has a long career with numerous roles, probably many of them doing that stereotypical frightened black man.Not very scary for a haunted house.", "This is the typical rainy night in the old house with the invalid uncle. People, terrified, running around. There is a chimpanzee name Yogi in the basement, for whatever reason. Apparently he doesn't like women. The only reason being that a young woman is about to show up. There is the reading of the will where one person inherits everything if the other one dies. We have a dredged up relationship with the housekeeper, her son, who feels he is wronged, and the invalid uncle. There are passageways, hairy hands, and other claptrap. There is a violinist who uses a McCauley Culkin trick to fool people. Anyway, there are some murders, the chimpanzee the prime suspect. The racist use of a chauffeur (what a great time in America!) and a whole bunch more. The young woman has a very strange look about her.

King Kong, eat your heart out.", "This is an absolutely terrible Horror/Mystery, that's painfully dull, with laughable dialog, and wooden performances. All the characters are boring, and the story is not very interesting, plus the only time the Ape really gets into act is in the final five minutes!. The script is also terrible, and there is absolutely no suspense or chills what so ever, and even at 63 minutes it's hard to get through. There is also no characters to root for, and before things start to heat up, you will most likely be asleep, or too bored out of your skull to care, plus the killer is pretty easy to figure out. I got this in a DVD set called Back From The Grave along with a bunch of other Horror films and I must say this deserves it's very low 3.8 rating, plus Vera Reynolds(Ruth) laughably overacts and is a terribly non convincing lead, along with Rex Lease (Dr. Ted Clayton). It's also extremely cheap, and very very low budget, and I say this should be a contender for IMDb's bottom 100, plus The Ape is terribly non scary. This is an absolutely terrible Horror/Mystery, that's painfully dull, with laughable dialog, and wooden performances, Avoid it at all costs!. The Direction is god awful. Frank R. Strayer does a god awful job here with inept camera work, and keeping the film painfully dull throughout. The Acting is laughably bad. Rex Lease is actually not all that bad as the Doc, but that isn't saying much, as his terrible dialog certainly Doesen't help matters any, and his chemistry with Vera Reynolds is non existent, still he managed to come out of this crap looking somewhat adequate. Vera Reynolds is pretty bad here, she laughably overacts, and had to spurt out terrible dialog throughout, not to mention her character irritated me. Sheldon Lewis is OK here, and plays the old/crazy man part adequately. Mischa Auer is also bad here, were supposed to find his character eerie, but instead it's boring and non scary. Rest of the cast are equally as bad. Overall avoid at all costs!. * out of 5 and that's being generous.", "In the 1920s and 30s (and even beyond), there were a long, long string of \"old dark house\" films where a string of murders occurs and the audience is expected to guess as to who the murderer is. In most cases, the murders occur because the murderer wants an inheritance or is bent on revenge. Regardless of why, I am getting pretty sick of the whole business because after a while the films all start to look the same. This film was especially difficult to watch because not only did it not open up any new ground, but it was also painfully dull and the production values were pretty shabby. In fact, before the film began I KNEW it would be this way because for comic relief, they cast \"Sleep n' Eat\" (later known as \"Willie Best\")--a character actor who was almost as stereotypical and offensive as Steppin' Fetchit. Fortunately, Best plays the part pretty straight here, but his early film moniker remains (\"Sleep n' Eat\"--how offensive can you get?!).As far as the rest of the acting goes, it was all pretty wooden and uninvolving. The nice young lady role was given to a woman with all the charisma of a piece of toast and the rest of the occupants of the house were pretty dull--even Mischa Auer. In fact, the only one who had the least bit of energy was the crazed chimp who was oddly cast in the film. He really didn't fit at all in the movie and I have no idea why they chose a chimp!! The bottom line is that this is a 3rd rate production made by a 3rd rate studio. It's uninteresting from start to finish but isn't silly enough to be a film for fans of bad movies (I LOVE to laugh at a bad film so bad that it makes me laugh). Avoid it unless you LIKE migraines.", "This venerable 1932 production looks prehistoric with its Poverty Row value and run-of-the-mill scripting. Basically, what we have here is another \"Old Dark House\" knock-off with a group of characters convening a meeting at night during a storm to hear the reading of a dead man's will. The chief problem with \"The Monster Walks\" is that there are not enough suspects and some characters may be ruled out in advance when the murders begin. Naturally, we aren't privy to some important information that might help us identify the killer. Moreover, the filmmakers have gone out of their way to complicate matters, especially after you learn about the outcome. Frank Strayer directs without urgency and drags out some red herrings to throw us off the scent. The use of an ape caged in the basement to generate suspense works initially until it is clear that the ape cannot escape his enclosure. The acting consists of a mixed bag, while the production designs look okay. If you're going to watch this to catch a glimpse of the eponymous Monster as it walks, you're in for a dire letdown. The monster never appears in full shot.", "Slow moving old dark house chiller consisting of several familiar traits associated with these kind of films. The heiress set to receive a fortune after returning home to her father's mansion for a will reading with her fianc\u00e9. Secret rooms and passageways. Suspicious characters that'd have a reason to harm her, such as the maid, her manservant son, and the invalid uncle all desiring a larger portion of the inheritance that is unavailable as long as she remains alive to collect. You have the thunderstorm and lighting outside. The killer constantly threatening to kill her, often failing to do so due to unforeseen circumstances. And, an amateur sleuth, attempting to solve the mystery as to who would wish for his beloved girl's demise.The film adds a primate caged in a basement, a pet of the deceased who was a follower of the Darwinian theory. The woman in peril is Ruth Earlton(Vera Reynolds), and her fianc\u00e9 is Dr. Ted Clayton(Rex Lease). Ruth's uncle is Robert(Sheldon Lewis), with crippled legs, always needing assistance and all around pitiable sight. Emma Krug(Martha Mattox)and her glum son, Hanns(Mischa Auer)are the hired help, really unhappy about how unappreciated they were by their former employer. A furry arm extends from behind a curtain over Ruth's bed attempting to strangle her, inevitably killing someone else on accident who was lying in her spot. Hanns has a secret as to why he's particularly angry, besides his mother's meager salary left to her in the will(..Hanns didn't receive anything just fueling his malice even further)..concerning Robert, who himself would get everything if Ruth were out of the picture. Clayton, along with Mr. Wilkes(Sidney Bracey), executor of the will, attempt to uncover whose behind the sneaky shenanigans involving his future wife.There's really nothing attractive about this fossil, as the cast(..or their characters for that matter) aren't that interesting(..a rather dull, colorless, stiff bunch)or is the mystery at the heart of the plot. The film pretty much goes out of it's way to tell us who the perpetrator is, and the whole scenario around the primate is rather embarrassing/laughable. African-Americans, I'm sure, will cringe at the treatment of Willie Best's chauffeur, the black man constantly ordered around like a mutt by his white superiors, who bark at him as he expresses his displeasure for being stuck at the mansion around a potentially dangerous ape. Best's character is slow, constantly befuddled, frightened, uneducated and subservient..it's a disturbing stereotype that would typecast black actors/actresses for decades to come. To top it all off, his character is told of how some believe we came from apes and he mentions how his grandfather favored one! The title is rather lame as well. This one isn't exactly worth pursuing, but of mild interest to fans of low budget B-movies, who enjoy films featuring a damsel in distress, a fortune coveted, and a series of events that lead to the unmasking of a concocted plan that falls apart. There have been better films featuring a similar kind of plot and characters(..without the caged ape, of course), and I'd say search elsewhere for better examples of the genre.", "Ruth Earlton (Vera Reynolds) inherits her wealthy father's estate, but will she live long enough to enjoy her new-found riches? Her fiance Ted (Rex Lease) tries to figure out who the killer is before he/she/it succeeds.A typical 'old dark house' mystery of the 30s, The Monster Walks does everything by the book, right down to the reading of a will, the hairy hand emerging from behind a wall panel to attack the heroine as she sleeps, the caged vicious ape in the basement, and a cowardly black manservant as comic relief. Chuck in a creepy housekeeper (Martha Mattox), her equally creepy son (Mischa Auer), a supposedly crippled uncle (Sheldon Lewis) and a suspicious looking attorney (Sidney Bracey), and the scene is set for a night of murder and intrigue, all occuring during a raging thunderstorm, naturally.There's clearly nothing remotely original about the plot for The Monster Walks, and director Frank R. Strayer conducts proceedings with little imagination, but his performers do what is required of them, and the pace is fairly quick (the film is just over an hour long), the result being a reasonably enjoyable albeit more-than-a-tad predictable thriller. If you're a fan of creaky old black and white movies that go bump in the night, then this'll provide some fun, but don't expect to see a monster walking: there isn't one.4.5/10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb.", "\"A woman and her boyfriend return to her ancestral home for the reading of her father's will.

Still Banks never got a part as good as Count Zaroff in which he could chew enough scenery for a three course meal and not be noticed.Joel McCrea plays an American big game hunter who is the sole survivor of a shipwreck who is washed up on Banks's island. In the palatial home he's built out of an old Portugese fort, McCrea encounters brother and sister Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray. Armstrong, in an unusual part for him, plays a wastrel playboy who is consuming the liquor at the home at a prodigious rate. He's taken to the 'trophy' room and not seen again.The next night McCrea and Wray discover that The Most Dangerous Game is man himself. Banks sends his guests out into the woods and stalks them like wild animals. Supposedly if they can elude him for 24 hours they earn their freedom, but no one ever has.The Most Dangerous Game is one of those films where you have no doubt who the hero and villain are. No moral ambiguities in this one. For all of Banks's talk about man being the most challenging animal to hunt, the only other man besides McCrea we see him hunt is drunk and pathetic Robert Armstrong. In McCrea because he's a hunter Banks finally meets an opponent who's a challenge. If Armstrong is a sample of what he hunted before, Banks ranks as one of the most malevolent villains ever portrayed on screen.If the sets look familiar to you remember the team of Meriam C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack is bringing you this film. A year later these same sets were utilized by RKO for the classic King Kong. Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong got to know that back lot jungle very well.Banks meets a most fitting end for one as evil as he which I can't reveal, but viewers will find it poetic indeed. After 75 years, The Most Dangerous Game is still one exciting, heart pounding, entertaining film.", "A solid little thriller with several things going for it, \"The Most Dangerous Game\" easily holds your attention all the way through, even at the more predictable points. It takes good advantage of an often-used plot idea, without trying to squeeze too much out of it. Joel McCrea makes a likable and confident hero, and he fits in well with Leslie Banks and with \"King Kong\" stars Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong. Banks's performance is a little on the eccentric side, but he has enough energy to make the character and the plot work most of the time.The opening sequence is a little slow, but it does set up some of the themes of the rest of the movie. The first half of the movie is generally predictable, yet even so it builds up a good amount of tension. In the last half, the suspense is sustained quite well for an extended time, and though the last few scenes may lack plausibility, they work well dramatically because they were set up carefully. Overall, it is an effective and rather efficiently-made thriller.", "THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME (RKO Radio, 1932), directed by Ernest B. Schoedsack and Irving Pichel, from the short story by Richard Connell, is a highly suspenseful drama with a neat twist in theme. But for the benefit for those who have never read Connell's original story nor seen the movie, this is something to really consider, especially for action and adventure fans. Categorized as a horror film, the only horror is the thought of a hunter being the hunted, especially by a crazed individual.The story begins with an explosion and the sinking of a yacht with Robert Rainsford (Joel McCrea) becoming the sole survivor of the perished crew. He swims to safety on a remote island and soon encounters an ancient mansion where lives the Russian Count Zoroff (Leslie Banks), and his muted servant, Ivan (Noble Johnson) and Tatur (Steve Clemento). After getting into some dry clothes, Rainsford is introduced to Zoroff's other guests, Eve (Fay Wray) and her brother, Martin Trowbridge (Robert Armstrong), also shipwreck survivors. Gathering in the living room, Zoroff discusses his interest in game hunting, but instead of hunting animals, which now bores him, he hunts his new interest - a most dangerous game. Later that night, Zoroff has made the drunken Martin his latest prey, and after returning from his all night hunt, Zoroff shows Eve and Rainsford his trophy room, consisting of human heads and corpses, with Martin's body being among them. Because Rainsford is a noted author and hunter, Zoroff wants him to go game hunting with him, the hunting of man. Refusing to take part in his mad scheme, Rainsford, in turn, becomes Zoroff's next prey. Zoroff promises that if Rainsford eludes him until sunrise, he and Eve are set free, and if he doesn't, gets to recapture Eve alive, since he doesn't hunt the \"female animal.\" Being given a 12 hour head start for preparation, Rainsford, with Eve's help, works against time using his brains instead of his feet to try and outsmart the hunter, but after midnight, the hunt begins, with Zoroff's tracking them down with weapons ranging from bow and arrow, rifle, and, as the last resort, the release of his vicious dogs, climaxed by surprises for both hunter and the hunted.THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME ranks one of the very best stories ever transferred on screen. In spite of alterations to Connell's original story, such as adding a female to accompany Rainsford, this adaptation is a fast-pace 65 minutes that never lets up for a minute. The first half hour devotes itself to character study, with Robert Armstrong's drunken performance somewhat slowing down the pace instead of providing humor. However, second half of the movie is tight on suspense, with the camera capturing every move and reaction from the three central characters, with Max Steiner's underscoring setting the mood and pace. Of course there's plenty of close calls and near misses to add to the excitement, making this a well staged and truly memorable experience after it is all over. What makes THE MOST DANGEROUSGAME worthy is the uncanny performance of British actor Leslie Banks, in his Hollywood debut, hamming it up to perfection, making his insane hunter come to life as intended by the author. Closeups of his eyes during the hunt is truly effective. If the jungle settings look familiar, it's the same set used for the much more famous adventure, KING KONG (RKO, 1933), that also features Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong.While Joel McCrea has been on screen since the silent era, starting from small roles to the elevation of leads, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME showcases him to best advantage, but cannot take away from the performance of Leslie Banks. While never a high rank leading man, McCrea did become a Hollywood survivor, better known for westerns, retiring from his successful career by 1962.THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME was remade as A GAME OF DEATH (RKO, 1945) with John Loder and Edgar Barrier; RUN FOR THE SUN (United Artists, 1956) with Richard Widmark, and recycled numerous times, but none have captured the greatness to the 1932 original. It's also interesting to note that the theme was used as the basis in one of the better episodes to the comedy series, GILLIGAN'S ISLAND, titled \"The Hunter\" with Rory Calhoun guest starring as the title character who hunts people, namely Gilligan (Bob Denver).Once regarded a \"lost\" movie, a print of THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME was discovered in the 1970s, and introduced to the small screen for the first time on public television in 1976. Prints shown in its initial premiere were crystal clear, but sadly, by the early 1980s, in the wake of home video, transfers circulated by distributors had that third to fourth generation look. A public domain title, it's unfortunate that a movie as good as this couldn't be available with better better picture quality. Aside from TV showings on various cable channels such as Nostalgia Television, and currently on some public TV stations after the midnight hours, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME had yet to be shown on any commercial free classic movie channels until Turner Classic Movies aired it on June 28, 2007, but because of its reputation, continues to circulate in the VHS and DVD markets to a very favorable audience. An instant classic not to be missed. (***)", "What a deliciously creepy and suspenseful film this is. We know what's coming, but that doesn't stop us from feeling real tension that builds into a crescendo with an extended hunt sequence in the second half of the film. Leslie Banks is fantastic as the intellectual and cruel Count Zaroff, and Joel McCrea and Fay Wray play their parts well. The film is hokey in places (such as a rather comical fighting/wrestling scene), but that adds to its camp value, as did recognizing some set elements from 'King Kong'. I found it easy to overlook the sillier things because the story itself is so strong \u2013 well ahead of its time, and re-used in countless movies and TV shows over the decades. A small example of that is the ending, which may remind modern viewers of 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'.Early on we're given some food for thought with this line: \"I was thinking of the inconsistency of civilization. The beast of the jungle, killing just for his existence, is called savage. The man, killing just for sport, is called civilized. It's a bit inconsistent, isn't it?\" We get action in the form of a shipwreck and shark attack. We get eeriness and sadism in the Count, as well as a pre-Code ominous hint of intended rape (\"Kill! Then love.\"), and that's all before an exciting game of \"outdoor chess\". There's a lot to like in this action-packed and fun film.", "Oft imitated but rarely equalled, The Most Dangerous Game stars Joel McCrea as big game hunter Bob Rainsford, who survives a shipwreck in the Pacific only to be washed up on a nearby island where deranged Russian aristo Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks, chewing the scenery in an unforgettably OTT performance) enjoys hunting humans for sport, man being 'the most dangerous game'.Pre-Hays code, the film is quite the eye-opener, from the opening ship wreck scene in which crew members are boiled alive and hapless survivors are dragged into the murky depths by ravenous sharks, to Zaroff's trophy room which features the severed heads of previous victims, to random moments of nasty violence (gotta love the impalement of Zaroff's henchman Ivan on a sharp stake). And let's not forget gorgeous Fay Wray (as Eve, survivor of a previous wreck) providing the eye-candy in a very clingy dress.The film also benefits from marvellous production design (Zaroff's impressive fortress and the surrounding jungle sets, some of which were also used for the original King Kong), a snappy run-time of just sixty-three minutes, and plenty of excitement, as Bob and Eve are sent into the jungle with just a knife to defend themselves from Zaroff (who tips the odds in his favour by arming himself with a bow and arrow, and later, a rifle and a pack of hounds).8.5/10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb - just don't watch the colourised version if you can help it.", "Ignoring the captain's fears, a ship makes its way through two signal buoys that are slightly off from where they're supposed to be. This is a big mistake, leading to a shipwreck, death, and the sole survivor, named Bob (Joel McCrea) having to swim his way to an island.Said island is inhabited by a man named Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks), who lives in an enormous, fortress-like house, with his frightening henchman, Ivan (Noble Johnson). Bob is introduced to two other \"guests\", named Martin (Robert Armstrong) and Eve (Fay Wray). As the evening wears on, the Count takes inordinate interest in the fact that Bob is a hunter. Zaroff reveals his own love of hunting, and soon facilitates his next big hunt. Obviously, this is when the title comes into play.THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is an excellent thriller, filled with foreboding and macabre imagery (i e: the \"trophy room\"). The house is loaded with dark hallways and vast rooms, and the jungle hunting ground is well-realized. Banks is perfect in his devilishly demented role. McCrea is a strong, heroic lead, and Ms. Wray puts in another great performance. Highly recommended!...", "The second most used plot device (boy meets girl is the first) happens to be one of my favorites, Man Vs. Man. The Most Dangerous Game (based upon a short story) is about an eccentric hunter who has hunted every single animal there is to hunt except one. Man. On his tropical island surrounded by dangerous coral reefs he seeks out prey so he can add them to his trophy case. That is until the day he happens to meet the world's most famous big game hunter. This excellent film was shot by the same crew that was shooting King Kong (both films nearly have the same cast) Between takes they would shoot this one. If you want to see where it all started, then this is it!!Highly recommended.A+", "Films from the 1930s often featured imaginary and exotic worlds brought to life on sound stages.  For us today the sets are unreal, creations of both limited imagination and limited budgets.  Most of those movies are justifiably in the \"B\" range.  A few aren't and among those is the relatively little seen \"The Most Dangerous Game.\"Joel McRae is globetrotting big game hunter Bob Rainsford on a yacht bound for exotic adventure.  Deliberately misplaced channel lights cause the vessel to hit rocks and founder.  Only Rainsford survives to drag himself onto the shore of a nearby island.  To his surprise the island is dominated by an eerie mansion owned by Count Zaroff, Leslie Banks.  A Cossack attended by a retinue of his countrymen, Zaroff exudes silken hospitality and refined culture.  Already there as guests are two people from a previous shipwreck, Eve Trowbridge, Fay Wray, and her perpetually drunken brother.Zaroff is the film version of that familiar figure from Russian literature, the eternally bored aristocrat whose anomie can only be defeated by extreme diversions.  In Zaroff's case it turns out that he, a skilled huntsman since boyhood, is only brought to vibrant life by stalking and killing the most dangerous prey - man.Zaroff offers Rainsford a deal he literally can't refuse.  Escape being slain by the count by outwitting him for a number of hours and he goes free. Eve elects to accompany the intrepid hunter on his journey through impenetrable backlot settings. Romance is in the humid air.Zaroff is, of course, evil but he's also oddly sympathetic.  What's a count to do when he can buy anything and only the most extraordinary hunting will bring him happiness?  In that light his trophy room becomes understandable, his bloody diversion almost sympathetic. Banks is very effective in this role where he swings between culture and carnage.Directors Irving Pickel and Ernest B. Schoedsack made \"The Most Dangerous Game\" on the same sets they'd employ a year later for the universally revered \"King Kong.\"  This film is only 63 minutes long indicating they intended it to be a second feature.  What they got was a truly engrossing movie with Fay Wray and Joel McCrea turning in first-rate performances.  Max Steiner's score is excellent (did he ever compose a bad one?).Released on DVD by Alpha Video, it's both a bargain and a pleasure.8/10", "Cooper and Schoedsack are, of course, the same directors who made King Kong. They actually made it right after they made this film on some of the same sets, and you'll recognize that, if you're a Kong aficionado. The Most Dangerous Game probably would be as well known as King Kong if it were a half-hour longer. As it stands, it's only 63 minutes. Half of that is exposition, and the other half the chase. That first half does drag a little. Some people will say the same thing about the exposition of King Kong, though I'd disagree. The comical drunk in The Most Dangerous Game is quite annoying, I must say. No matter. Once the hunt begins, I dare you to try to take a breath. I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat that entire half-hour. Bravo, good sirs. Once again, you have proved yourselves to be entirely undervalued filmmakers. Make sure, if you like this and/or King Kong, to see their early documentaries Grass and Chang, which are two near masterpieces themselves. 8/10.", "This classic was co-directed by Irving Pichel and Ernest B. Schoedsack and while some of its effects might seem rather rudimentary by today's standards it's still a cracker. The basic story has been filmed countless times in one form or another but \"The Most Dangerous Game\" still knocks its competitors for six. Set in one of those exotic South Sea Islands so beloved of filmmakers in the 1930's, (you know, the kind of place where King Kong hung out), this is the one about the big game hunter, (Joel McCrea), becoming the hunted, victim to the monstrous Count Zaroff, (a splendidly over-the-top Leslie Banks). There's also a woman involved, (a screaming Fay Wray, naturally), and it's both exciting and superbly designed, (Zaroff's 'fortress' home could just as easily have housed Dr. Frankenstein or Count Dracula). Clocking in at just 63 minutes, this is a B-Movie with A-Movie credentials and is hugely enjoyable.", "\"Until you've hunted men, you haven't hunted\" -Jesse Ventura, April 2001.The story of a hunter having the tables turned on him is overly familiar to today's audiences. The basic premise of Richard Connell's short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\" has also been reinvented as a Game of Death, Run for the Sun, Hard Target, Surviving the Game, The Running Man, and even Predator (starring the Governor Ventura himself). But the irony and purity of the story are exercised best in this 1932 quickie, made by the King Kong team, using the same cast members and sets. It's legacy has been somewhat overshadowed by the popularity of Kong, but don't let it slip away, The Most Dangerous Game is a game worth playing.Robert Rainsford (Joel McCrea) is a big game hunter who is shipwrecked somewhere off the east coast of South America. He washes up on a beach of a lonely island and makes his way through the jungle where he is greeted by the eccentric Count Zaroff who has settled in a restored Portuguese fortress. The Count escaped Russia before the revolution and travelled the world hunting animals. But having killed all of the most savage he has grown bored and needs an animal with wits, cunning, and intelligence. Man; the most dangerous game of all.Finding his match with Rainsford, the Count releases him into the jungle, along with the screaming Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray), and promises him freedom if he can survive the next 24 hours. The sets, the Gothic atmosphere, and even the loneliness creates a wonderful atmosphere. As one of the first \"talkies\" the film is backed-up by a score (in a time when music really had to carry wordless motion pictures) that really stands out to me for several reasons. It's certainly the earliest film I have seen with a recognizable melody and even goes as far as having the Count play the theme on his grand piano; a nice little in-joke. I never thought I'd recommend a score from a 1932 movie for being mysterious and action-packed but, if you excuse the pun, I suggest you hunt it down.At 63 minutes the film doesn't outstay his welcome, but James Ashmore Creelman's screenplay was written as a film lasting no less than 85 minutes, so I'm curious to know what RKO Pictures cut out to keep the budget down.Criterion did a good job with the DVD, but the film desperately needs a full HD restoration. I suppose the original camera negative is gone, but a 4k master from a complete 35mm print is what this film needs. No nicks, no scratches, no missing frames. If The Most Dangerous Game doesn't get this an overlooked classic may be lost forever.", "Evil and depraved big game hunter Zaroff (deliciously played with lip-smacking wicked relish by Leslie Banks) hunts humans for sport on his remote island. Zaroff chooses fellow well known big game hunter Robert Rainsford (a solid and likable performance by Joel McCrea) to be his latest quarry. Directors Irving Pickel and Ernest B. Schoedsack, working from a compact script by James Ashmore, relate the absorbing story at a quick pace, milk the dark premise for all its worth (Zaroff's trophy room with the bodies of his previous victims is truly grotesque and startling), and deftly stage the major hunting set piece in which Zaroff and Rainsford match wits. It's the second half of this movie that really makes it hum: It's remarkably tense, gripping, and exciting as all hell, with loads of suspense, jolting moments of sudden ferocious violence, and a dandy conclusion. Moreover, Banks' sublimely slimy portrayal of Zaroff delivers a pleasing mix of suavely decadent menace and alarmingly twisted perversity. Fay Wray makes for a suitably fetching and appealing damsel in distress. Henry W. Gerrard's crisp black and white cinematography provides a fine moody look. Max Steiner's dynamic full-bore score hits the stirring spot. Only Robert Armstrong's irritating turn as annoying comic relief drunk Martin detracts a bit from the substance of this otherwise sterling movie. Worthy of its classic status.", "Well-heeled hunter Joel McCrea (as Robert Rainsford) survives a yacht wreck and shark attacks, then finds himself washed up on a mysterious island. Stranded, Mr. McCrea finds refuge with the island's only inhabitant, creepy Russian Count Leslie Banks (as Zaroff). In Mr. Banks' fortress castle, McCrea meets survivors of a previous shipwreck, beautiful Fay Wray (as Eve Trowbridge) and her boozy brother Robert Armstrong (as Martin Trowbridge). McCrea is pleased to discover Mr. Banks shares his interest in big game hunting; Banks tells McCrea, \"We are kindred spirits.\" But, Banks' choice of prey becomes a problem for his houseguestsFrom many of the folks who were soon to unleash \"King Kong\" (1933) on an unsuspecting public, this well-paced early talkie is a classic due to associations with its RKO Radio Picture cousin (there are several similarities). The subject matter is intriguing. And, more importantly, \"The Most Dangerous Game\" features Banks' delightful scenery-chewing, ahead-of-its-time characterization of the articulate madman \"Zaroff\". Both Richard Connell's story, and Banks' take on the villainous character, would be much imitated.******** The Most Dangerous Game (9/16/32) Ernest B. Schoedsack ~ Joel McCrea, Leslie Banks, Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong", "A luxury yacht is on a questionable course. The captain advises caution but the rich privileged passengers dismiss the warning. They crash into unseen rocks. Safari hunter and author Bob Rainsford (Joel McCrea) is the sole survivor. He swims to shore and finds a mansion owned by Russian Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks) with his mute manservant Ivan. Zaroff is hosting survivors from an earlier wreck; Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray), her brother Martin (Robert Armstrong), and two other sailors. The scarred Zaroff claims to have created The Most Dangerous Game after getting bored with hunting animals. Martin is a clueless drunk but Eve is leery of the count.This is really simple and really effective B-movie material. The most important Hollywood connection is its ties to King Kong. It has Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong with many of the same jungle sets which are reused for King Kong. The movie itself treats the material seriously and keeps the hunt to its second half. It is fascinating that the hunt never gets boring despite not having much dialogue. The locations keep moving and the excitement never dies. The characters are simple from the boy scout hero to the silent era damsel to the drunk and finally to the villain. It's really good and like the B-side to the legendary King Kong.", "Imagine this: a remote jungle island set in a lonely sea. A solitary chateau outfitted with every luxury & inhabited by a charming lunatic. A lovely young woman & her drunken, boorish brother. And a celebrated big game hunter who suddenly finds himself to be the prey.This is an excellent adventure movie, imitated many times but never equaled. Once the hunt begins, the suspense doesn't let up. It keeps on pounding until the last bark of the savage hounds used to track down the helpless quarry.The film was shot, largely at night, on the same jungle sets being used by day for KING KONG; four cast members appeared in both films. Joel McCrea & Fay Wray make a fine romantic couple, with Robert Armstrong suitably annoying in the small role of the intoxicated brother.But it is Leslie Banks as the mad Russian, Count Zaroff, who remains in the mind the longest. Like a sophisticated & urbane serpent, he coils himself around his florid role of the master huntsman who has discovered a new sensation - that of stocking his island & hunting through its jungles the most dangerous big game of them all...", "It's time to play the game. 'The Most Dangerous Game\" in fact. Directly adapted for film at least eight times, though only twice under its original title, this 1932 movie directed by Irving Pichel & Ernest B. Schoedsack is the very first film version of the 1924 short story by author Richard Connell of the same name. Like the book, the movie tells the story of a big game hunter, Sanger 'Bob' Rainsford, (Joel McCrea) being hunted for sport, by another big game hunter, named Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks) on a jungle island. However, unlike the book, this RKO Pictures' film change the plot, somewhat around, when they added, female character, Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray), and her brother Martin (Robert Armstrong), into the mixed to tag along with Rainsford. This big change from the source material is a hard watch for me, as I never like, the idea of Count Zaroff being alright in hunting down, people that he views are not a challenge to him. After all, what contest is he getting off, on, if he's killing drunk fools and helpless women! I get that, his character is a social Darwinist, but it always seem like his character was a man, looking for a real fight. Man Vs Man. It just doesn't seem right, to see him, picking on helpless people. Another thing that bug me, about the movie, is the fact that many of the sets and looks, are taken from previous films. I hate that Count Zaroff's castle looks like something out of 1931's Dracula. I also hate the fact that film was shot at night on the 1933's King Kong jungle sets. It's just way too jarring. Even, the fact, Count Zaroff looks like actor Bela Lugosi in 1932's White Zombie & his assistant, Ivan (Noble Johnson) seem a little too similar to the zombies-like henchmen in that film is distracting. White-face, anyone! Despite that, I do like how the style of the assistant was later used for Ygor in 1939's Son of Frankenstein, played by no other, than Bela Logosi. So that was nice. I just wish, the writers kept Zaroff, as General than a Count. It's seem to me, that Leslie Banks was acting like an over-the top- Count Dracula rip-off. Another thing, that kinda bug me, is Fay Wray's character. She adds nearly nothing to the film. Her own purpose is to weights the hero down. I hate that, she always has to be rescue by Rainsford. It's like watching 1933's King Kong, all over again. Unlike the book, it seems to me, that Rainsford was never really given a fair fight in this movie. Three days is cut off, as a day. Despite that, Joel McCrea was alright as the hero role. His character was kinda a jerk, but at least, he wasn't the 'All-American Boy Scout' mode that most films, at the time, would portray their main characters. I like the fact, that his character survived a shipwrecked, rather than falling overboard like a fool. It's a nice important. Better than the novel's idea, of getting him, on the island. I also like how the movie didn't go with \"The Hounds of Zaroff\", titled like the novel. I always felt that, 'The Hounds of Zaroff' title, sounds like a Sherlock Holmes's 'Hounds of Baskerville' rip-off. I'm glad, they went with 'Most Dangerous Game', instead. I'm also happy that this movie was released before the Hays Code was widely enforced. As a result both Joel McCrea and Fay Wray were able to get away with wearing relatively little clothing in comparison to other films of the era. Even the violent in the film, seem a lot more graphic than most films at the time. However, some of the trophy room scenes were cut in the final version, as the studio felt like, seeing a few more heads in jars and mounted stuff sailors was a little too much for the audience. I just wish, these shots would one day, be released to the public. Even seeing, Robert Armstrong playing a drunk bum, was controversial. At the time this film was released, Prohibition was still in effect, but the law was widely ignored. Producer of the film, Merian C. Cooper was strongly critical of alcohol use and of the glamorization of drunkenness in movies. Another great message is the conflict between, reason vs instinct, the effects of war, and how the color red even shine in the darkness. Even with the strong moral message of the film, within a few years, the film was considered indecent and too revealing. It was barred from re-release and was not shown publicly for several decades. Until, the failure of the original copyright holder to renew the film's copyright resulted in it falling into public domain, meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHS/DVD copy of the film. Therefore, many of the versions of this film available on the market. However, some of them are either severely or badly edited and/or of extremely poor quality, having been duplicated from second- or third-generation (or more) copies of the film. Overall: While, not a lot of people have saw this movie. Its basic concept has been borrowed for numerous films and episodes of television series. Even if you haven't saw this film, you see, the movie themes live on, with films like 2000's Battle Royale, 1987's Predator, and 2012's The Hunger Games. In the end, while this film might be a little dated action. It's still worth checking out. You would find out, you had never slept in a better bed, after watching this film.", "Modern Audiences surely must recognize the Story. The Richard Connell Novel has been the Inspiration of many a Movie and TV Productions. This one was the First and is a Grand Guignol Treat. The Movie is Atmospheric and Creepy, Frightening and Action Packed.It is Compact in its barely One Hour Running Time and things don't let up for a Minute. It is a Legendary Film, because of its King Kong (1933) Auteurs. In Addition there is the Incredible, Maniacal Performance from the less well known Leslie Banks as Count Zaroff playing alongside Joel McCrea and Faye Wray.For a Finishing Touch of Grandeur there is the Max Steiner Score. In 1932 it was Virtually Unheard of to Write a Complete Movie Score and it adds another Welcome Dimension to this already Rich and Rewarding Film.There are a Number of Quotable Lines. When McCrea Returns to the Castle and Surprises Zaroff the Count says...\"Well Mr. Rainsford you have beaten Me.\" He answers...\"Not yet.\" It is also a Sexually Charged Script with much Pre-Code Emphasis that also included some Horrific Visuals and Violence.", "\"The Most Dangerous Game\" of 1932 is a masterpiece the production of which largely included the same team as one of the most famous films in history, \"King Kong\" (1933), and while this film does not reach the same level of fame, it easily is an equally impressive milestone and maybe one of the most exciting films ever brought to screen. Adapted from Richard Connel's story of the same name and directed by Irving Pichel and Ernest B. Schoedsack (who also co-directed \"King Kong\"), \"The Most Dangerous Game\" simply is an overwhelming cinematic experience in all aspects: exceptionally filmed in fantastic settings, this film is an incredibly suspenseful thriller with a genuinely macabre premise, that is pioneering in its effects and action sequences and, probably most importantly, it introduces one of the most memorable villains ever in cinema, the demented hunter. This demented hunting enthusiast is Count Zaroff, and while the story has often be re-filmed, Leslie Banks' diabolical Count Zaroff in this film remains cinema's most memorable 'Mad Hunter' (and one of the all-time greatest villains) to this day.After surviving a shipwreck, famed hunter and hunting-book author Bob Rainsford (Joel McCrea) strands on a remote island where the Russian Count Zaroff welcomes him into his eerie mansion. After Bob is introduced to fellow castaways, the beautiful Eve (Fay Wray) and her drunken brother, it turns out that Zaroff is a fellow hunting enthusiast. What Bob doesn't know, however, is that Zaroff prefers to hunt for a very particular kind of 'game'...This film simply is amazing in all regards. As said above, Zaroff is one of the greatest villains in cinema history. Villains are usually more interesting than heroes, especially in classic 30s cinema. Yet this film also has an interesting hero, greatly portrayed by Western star Joel McCrea. Bob Rainsford is an early form of the action hero, so the film's character as a milestone even includes the hero. Leslie Banks still steals the show as Count Zaroff, though. Banks is brilliantly sinister in the role of the insane hunting enthusiast, whose macabre hobby is the hunting of humans. Zaroff is so dedicated to the hunting-sport that he cannot understand Rainsford's abhorrence for the idea of hunting human beings. The Count's dedication is manifested in unforgettably creepy speeches. At the same time, he is wonderfully cynical, sarcastically repeating what others have said. Fay Wray's female leading character may seem extremely defenseless and dependent on male help by today's standards; on must keep in mind that this was made in the 30s, however, and Miss Wray is lovable and very beautiful. The film is extremely fast-paced and exciting and does not include a single length. Maybe more than any other film from its time, \"The Most Dangerous Game\" offers non-stop thrills paired with some of the most remarkable action sequences of its time. The shark-sequence in the beginning and the breathtaking chase near the end are just two examples for this. Some of the settings were re-used for \"King Kong\" a year later, and they also form the perfect scenery for this brilliant film. In a nutshell: This film is as memorable as its villain. One of the most influential classics of the 30s and simultaneously one of the most exciting films ever made, \"The Most Dangerous Game\" is a sensational masterpiece that everyone even remotely interested in cinema MUST see! Is there a higher rating than 10 out of 10?", "After surviving a shipwreck in reefs not signalized in the maritime charts, the famous hunter Rober \"Bob\" Rainsford (Joel McCrea) is lodged by the Russian hunter Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks) in his castle in an isolated island. Bob meets Eve Trowbridge (Fay Wray) and her brother Martin Trowbridge (Robert Armstrong) also survivors of another wrecked vessel and hosted by Zaroff. Sooner, Bob and Eve find that they are part of a hunting game plotted by the insane Zarof where they are the chase, and they have to escape and survive until the next morning to Zaroff and his hounds.\"The Most Dangerous Game\" is a great adventure, where the target is surviving a different hunting where humans are chased. I do not know how many recent movies I have seen with variations of this storyline, but certainly this is the first, or at least one of the first, to explore this theme. One of the greatest attractions of this movie is that it was shot simultaneously with \"King Kong\", having the same director, crew, locations and many actors (Robert Armstrong, Noble Johnson, Steve Clement) and the actress Fay Wray, who became famous with her screams in a time where cinema was changing from silent to spoken films. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Zaroff o Ca\u00e7ador de Vidas\" (\"Zaroff The Hunter of Lives\")", "\"The Most Dangerous Game\" is a surprisingly good little thriller that runs just over an hour. It was made the year before \"King Kong\" by many of the same people that were involved that classic. In fact many of the \"run through the jungle\" scenes are very similar to those in the later film.The film opens with a realistic staged ship wreck (achieved mostly with convincing miniatures) from which only Bob Rainsford (Joel McCrea) survives. He crawls ashore on a mysterious island and finds his way to a creepy castle inhabited by a Russian Count named Zaroff (Leslie Banks). There he meets the lovely Eve (Fay Wray) and her drunken brother Martin (Robert Armstrong), who were also ship wrecked.It turns out that the \"Game\" of the title is the mad Count hunting down and killing human prey. Naturally, McCrea and Wray ultimately wind up as the hunted.A very young McCrea is excellent as the hero and Wray, fetching as the heroine. Banks, however, and Armstrong for that matter, are way over the top in their roles. Banks in that early talkie style, enunciates every syllable and bugs out his eyes at every opportunity.Still and all, \"The Most Dangerous Game\" is exciting and well made and worth a look.", "Based on a rousing short story, \"The most dangerous game\" tells the tale of a famous hunter who finds himself stranded on a distant island. There he meets a complete madman who has developed a taste for hunting the most dangerous animal of all, to wit homo sapiens...\"Game\" is a pretty successful movie in the tradition of the great horror or adventure movies of the 1930's. It must have impressed the hell out of a lot of people, since its influence was to prove both wide-ranging and long-lasting. Just watch the suave-yet-demented Russian aristocrat with his sinister castle and his equally sinister henchmen - and then watch, say, a handful of \"Bond\" movies. It will become clear that our villain sired many, many other villains. (Now that I think about it, the Russian count may also have inspired the Montgomery Burns character in \"The Simpsons\", at least where the \"release the hounds\" joke is concerned.) The idea of humans being hunted for sport, too, had considerable legs - just look at the \"Predator\" movies.The various props are particularly well-done : not only does the castle boast a Front Door from Hell, there's a tapestry showing leering, violent mythological creatures that could keep a whole international meeting of psychiatrists busy.Just sit down in a comfortable chair and open the popcorn, the 1930's are here to provide you with some prime adventure...", "The Most Dangerous Game is a terrific old barn-stormer. A horror-thriller from the same talents that produced King Kong. Indeed, the movie re-used several of Kong's sets, and was conceived in order to get more value for money from Kong's colossal budget. It is, however, a thrilling adventure in its own right.Kong Alumni Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong and Nobel Johnson turn up here (the film was shot almost simultaneously with Kong) but the British actor Leslie Banks steals the show as Count Zaroff, Russian game hunter who has grown bored with hunting animals, and now prefers to hunt \"The most dangerous game of all\". Banks is a hoot as Zaroff, perpetually stroking his scar and giving lustful gazes in the direction of Fay Wray. He's also splendidly wry in his exchanges with Robert Armstrong's drunken sot, and adopts a maniacal intensity during the hunt.Zaroff, occupying a remote island, has adjusted the navigation lights of a treacherous stretch of water to ship-wreck passing vessels. Those who escape the shark-infested waters and make it to the island are given rest, food and are eventually invited to spend a few hours in Zaroff's trophy room. Believe me, it's a good incentive for what Zaroff plans! They are given a days' head start, and then Zaroff begins hunting...Joel Mcrea makes an engaging hero as young hunter Bob Rainsford, who eventually out-thinks and outfights the nasty ol' Count. The later half of the movie, in which Mcrea and Wray are hunted through the jungle by the merciless Zaroff is brilliantly shot and edited. Max Steiner, the composer of Kong's classic score, here comes up with another memorable main theme. Zaroff even plays it at the piano. Irving Pichel, the goon from Murder By The Clock, co-directs with Kong director Shoedsack and delivers a rousing movie. I saw this as a DVD double bill with White Zombie, and had a splendid evening's entertainment!", "This influential film has a quick pace and so much action that it hasn't dated at all in the past seventy years. While most films of the period were slow and stately, this wastes little time in setting up the characters, instead preferring to cut right to the chase. The short running time means that the plot is constantly furthered and there is no time for hanging about. The simple idea of a human using other humans for sport is one with limitless possibilities and one which has been used countless times since in the likes of GAME OF DEATH and HARD TARGET. It also probably influenced the man vs. man cat-and-mouse antics of DIE HARD and all the films which followed but here you see it for the first time.The acting is pretty good, with Joel McCrea as a talented and likable hero who does everything that an action man should. The unbeatable Fay Wray (from KING KONG, of course) lends her vocal chords to a glamorous woman-in-peril role, just a year before she'd appear in the same sets being chased by a gigantic ape. Leslie Banks puts in a camp performance as the sinister Count Zaroff and seems to be trying to ape Bela Lugosi's acting style. The fact that half his face was paralysed as a result of injuries sustained during the First World War makes him all the more eerie. Noble Johnson, a black actor used to playing slaves, zombies or man servants, is unusually cast as a Cossack and dons 'white face' makeup throughout.The plot is kept nicely simple and doesn't need to be complicated - there are no unnecessary characters, everybody has their own purpose. The only flaw I can think of with the film is a blatantly unrealistic shipwreck scene which looks just like a model - other than this, everything about the film is flawless. Obviously the best part of the film is the 20-minute chase at the conclusion, which has plenty of danger and excitement to please any fan. Traps are set up, arrows and bullets fly everywhere, and a pack of vicious, evil-looking stinking dogs run about and savage people. Remember how in Dracula the camera shied away from all the violence and left it off screen? Not so here. If you ever thought that all '30s films were prudish when it came to violence then think again. This film has it all - people being killed on screen, severed heads on plaques and in tanks, stabbings, and even a gruesome spine-breaking which comes out of nowhere. Apparently the film was even more gruesome, but after the adverse reaction of a test audience the gory shots had to be significantly reduced and the footage is now lost, which is a shame. Still, THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME is nevertheless a supremely entertaining thrill-ride of a film that stands up to repeat viewing and should be a staple for all fans of classic cinema."], "tt0023245": ["I love these Universal horror movies. This one is all atmosphere. The lighting, the focus on Karloff's eyes and his threatening persona carry the film. When I was in elementary school (my kids would say not long after this film was made), I had another kid scare the daylights out of me by describing the internment of the Egyptian rulers. The taking of the body, perfuming it, placing it in a room full of gold, then killing the slaves so that only the priests would know the actual resting place of the body. There was also the bit about being wrapped alive for burial. I'll tell you.The effect of that story, which is portrayed in the movie, put a bigger scare into me than any movie I've ever seen. Since this one was really the only one we would ever see on television, I watched it every time I could. Isn't it interesting that both the Lugosi \"Dracula\" use a quotation from \"Swan Lake\" as a theme song. I've always wondered why that is. It is certainly eerie and as the credits roll, it builds in intensity. I was told once that Tchaikovsky would probably do movie soundtracks if he were alive today. Pardon my digressions. It is interesting that the mummy (as a fully wrapped personage) really doesn't appear after the beginning sequence--we just know that old Boris is in the process of decay and will eventually be sent to his eternal reward. As usual, the scientists and those who should know, carelessly leave the young woman unattended and he makes his move. The threatening suavity of Karloff is the high point of the movie. I feel the world received such a gift when these films were made. It is a delight, full of frightening images and classic moments.", "With one of Boris Karloff's numerous acting successes and a production done the way that a horror feature should be made, this is a well-crafted classic of the genre. From the first scene, the right atmosphere is established, and the story is told at an implacable pace that slowly builds up the tension and possibilities.As he does with his characters in so many of his horror features, Karloff makes \"The Mummy\" a menacing monster, yet one with enough human motivations to keep him from becoming cartoonish. Karloff's approach, as does the movie as a whole, stimulates the imagination rather than the senses, giving this classic version a depth and permanence that cannot be matched by those more recent adaptations that rely on boring \"special\" effects and contrived \"action\" sequences instead of a well-told story with solid characters.Edward Van Sloan, David Manners, and the rest of the supporting cast also help out. The atmosphere and settings are kept relatively simple, but effective. Naturally, the story is far-fetched, but it has a consistency that makes it relatively easy to suspend disbelief. The picture fits together well, and it remains a solid entry in the list of classic horror films.", "This Universal classic (1933)\u00a8The mummy\u00a8 that ahead many follow-ups was finely directed by Karl Freund with Boris Karloff, Edward Van Sloan , David Manners and it results to be the first and classic rendition of the \u00a8Mummy\u00a8.

Superb atmosphere , flavorful music , make this one of the best terror movies from Universal , using intelligence and interesting dialogue rather than guts and blood to horrify its audience .

Boris is terrific as the terrifying mummy and David Manners is good as an obstinate archaeologist , one of the men he frightens , being attacked by the mummy, as well as Zita Johann as the damsel in distress . The Mummy is masterfully incarnated by Boris Karloff , giving one of his best movie portrayals along with Frankenstein . Boris is almost irrecognisable beneath layers of skillful make-up, undergoing 8 hours of top-notch make-up to transform him into the creepy mummy , being layered on his face filament by filament , and actually giving the impression of having been hidden away for centuries .

And recent \u00a8The mummy\u00a8 (2017) with Tom Cruise and Sophie Boutella .", "Although frequently reinterpreted, the original 1932 THE MUMMY remains the most intriguing film version of a story inspired by both 1920s archaeological finds and the 1931 Bela Lugosi Dracula: when an over-eager archaeologist reads an incantation from an ancient scroll, he unexpectedly reanimates a mysterious mummy--who then seeks reunion with the princess for whom he died thousands of years earlier and ultimately finds his ancient love reincarnated in modern-day Egypt.Less a typical horror film than a Gothic romance with an Egyptian setting, THE MUMMY has few special effects of any kind and relies primarily upon atmosphere for impact--and this it has in abundance: although leisurely told, the film possesses a darkly romantic, dreamlike quality that lingers in mind long after the film is over. With one or two exceptions, the cast plays with remarkable restraint, with Boris Karloff as the resurrected mummy and Zita Johann (a uniquely beautifully actress) standouts in the film. The sets are quite remarkable, and the scenes in which Karloff permits his reincarnated lover to relive the ancient past are particularly effective.Kids raised on wham-bam action and special effects films will probably find the original THE MUMMY slow and uninteresting, but the film's high quality and disquieting atmosphere will command the respect of both fans of 1930s horror film and the more discerning viewer. Of all the 1930s Universal Studio horror films, THE MUMMY is the most subtle--and the one to which I personally return most often.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer", "THE MUMMY awakened in Egypt by English archeologists goes on a rampage searching for its reincarnated lover.Boris Karloff dominates this little fright fest, bringing new nightmares to the screen and proving that his Frankenstein's Monster was no mere quirk, but actually the beginning of a distinguished career in shocker films. Helped immensely by makeup master Jack Pierce, who gave the Mummy face & hands like weathered parchment, Karloff uses his own saturnine features and tall thin body to full effect, creating a horror portrait that has stood the test of time.A sturdy supporting cast gives Karloff good support: exotic Zita Johann is lovely & slightly mysterious as the woman of Imhotep's deathless desires; valiant David Manners as the young hero gives another typically fine performance; Arthur Byron & Edward Van Sloan are enjoyable as the requisite old gentlemen (every horror film must have at least one) who study & stalk the Mummy. African-American silent film star Noble Johnson appears as a sinister Nubian.The film's best scene, the resuscitation of the Mummy, demonstrates the potential of the medium. The only indication the viewer has that something horrible is about to happen is a flicker of Karloff's eye and a slight movement of his hand as he stands in his casket, bound in bandages. The rest of the scene unfolds in the hysterical reaction of young Bramwell Fletcher (excellent performance) as he watches the undead leave the scientists' tent. All the audience sees is Karloff's hand and the trailing bandages from his feet as they drag across the floor. It is enough.", "I love the classic horror movies of the 1930s. They were made when the talkies were still novel and film makers were experimenting with storytelling approaches, often taking inspirations from German Expressionism (indeed 'The Mummy's director Karl Freund, who later directed another 1930s classic 'Mad Love', originally worked as a cinematographer on Fritz Lang's science fiction classic 'Metropolis' and several movies by F.W. Murnau). And it was before the Hayes Code kicked in and took a lot of the fun and thrills out of horror movies (just look at how safe and uninteresting horror became in the 1940s with a few notable exceptions e.g. the movies produced by Val Lewton). The film obviously owes a lot to 'Dracula' and Edward Van Sloan and David Manners from that film reappear here in similar roles. Karloff is brilliant as Imhotep a.k.a The Mummy, and stage actress Zita Johann is wonderful too, very striking with exotic good looks. Too bad she became very quickly disillusioned with Hollywood as she should have been a major screen star. Karloff and Johann are fantastic on screen together, and make 'The Mummy' impossible to forget. I was quite surprised to discover that this movie wasn't enormously successful when originally released, but it has obviously captured the imagination of thousands of film fans since. It is easily the best Mummy movie ever made (though I also have a fondness for Hammer's \"Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' made almost forty years later), and much more entertaining and intelligent than the awful remake starring Brendan Fraser et al. 'The Mummy' stands alongside 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Island Of Lost Souls', 'Freaks', 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Black Cat' as one of the best horror movies of the 1930s, an era that has had an enormous impact on horror ever since. Highly recommended!", "The great story of the mummy Imhotep who comes to life again after scientists discover the grave of his beloved female Egyptian Priest will be told many times again after this original from 1932. But never again will it be so magical. Never again will it be so scary with the use of so less effects. Boris Karloff BECOMES Imhotep, just like he became Frankenstein in the earlier monster classic. His achievement makes this film immortal. Even in another 75 years he will still be the one and only Mummy to me. This classic monster production from Universal delivers. It's grabs your attention from the very first minute and it doesn't let you go. Most of the credit for that go to Karloff himself of course. His voice and especially those eyes !!! All the modern computer generated skills can never give the same horrific effect as Boris Karloff's creepy look. The mummification at the end, the few close ups when the camera stares right in his eyes...those are images who can never ever die !! I have to give some credit to the rest of the cast as well of course. Zita Johann is absolutely gorgeous as the Princess Anckesen-Amon. Imhotep sees in Helen Grosvenor the reincarnation of his long lost Egyptian priest. Only her love for archaeologist Frank Whemple can save her. Edward Van Sloan, also a great legend in early horror ( he played in Frankenstein and was the very first Dr. Van Helsing in Dracula with Bela Lugosi ) plays a very memorable part in this film as well. His character, Dr Muller, is an expert in the field of the Egyptian culture. Overall, like the credits in they end say \" A good cast is worth repeating\" I think that's great.I'm a great fan of the Egyptian Myths and recommend this film to everyone who likes this great culture as well. I also advise you to see the Hammer version starring Peter Cushing and Christoper Lee and The mummy lives starring Tony Curtis. I do not like the modern version of the mummy actually. Brendan Fraser is good the CGI effects spoiled the magic for me. It's loyal to the story, I gotta give it that. Finally, I would have loved to be there when this film came out back in 1932. Only a few years after the amazing discovery of the tomb of Tut. this must have been gigantic. I heard the audience was frightened to death when Karloff opened his eyes for the first time. The hype back then, I would love to be a part of that. My humble opinion on The Mummy...what do you think ... 10/10 !!! This title comes with my highest recommendations", "Boris Karloff plays Imhotep, a cursed Egyptian buried alive 3700-years-ago, returns to life to claim the reincarnation of his lost-love in this Universal classic. Moody, understated and succinct, The Mummy is one of the best films from Universal's classic horror period. Although much of the success can be credited to first time director Karl Freund, who normally worked as a top cinematographer, and the brilliant make-up artist Jack P. Pierce, it is Boris Karloff who gives the film its resonance. As he previously did with the Frankenstein monster, Karloff imbues this character with an aching sense of humanity which was completely absent later incarnations of the Mummy character. Credit must also be given to the able supporting cast including Zita Johann and the always reliable Edward Van Sloan. Now here's a question. Is the film scary by today's standards? I guess I'd have to say not really. However, I just watched this film again after seeing the American version of 'The Grudge.' 'The Grudge' certainly had me jumping more, but which film did I enjoy more? It'd have to be 'The Mummy.'", "Karl Freund, who photographed some of the most memorable silent films made both in this country and Germany, turned director only twice in his career.  He directed Peter Lorre in MAD LOVE (1935) and Boris Karloff in this film I am about to discuss. Following FRANKENSTEIN and THE OLD DARK HOUSE the public knew it liked Boris Karloff but he had been silent in his two biggest roles.  When this movie was released they flocked to the cinema to hear him speak (evidently they had missed THE MIRACLE MAN, NIGHT WORLD, BUSINESS AND PLEASURE and the other minor roles he appeared in while FRANKENSTEIN was becoming a hit). His voice was no disappointment and neither was his performance in this picture. Director Freund handles many important scenes as if he were directing a silent film . . .and it WORKS!  The scene of Im-Ho-Tep returning to life is masterful, as is the flashback sequence where he shows his reincarnated princess just what became of him.  David Manners is a far more practical hero in this film than he was in DRACULA (and he is not hampered by having to wear those ridiculous knickerbockers) and Edward van Sloan is fabulous yet again.  Watch for Noble Johnson showing off his muscular frame as the Nubian servant.  Jack Pierce's makeup is nothing short of fantastic; what he did with gum cotton and collodion was truly masterful.  The photography is very well done also.  One scene where the camera flashpans away from Im-Ho-Tep and over the rooftops of Cairo coming to rest on Helen Grosvenor is truly Germanic.  A similar scene appears in FAUST (1926), and also in SVENGALI (1931). Red Rock Canyon substitutes for ancient Egypt but we always believe we are seeing just what we are supposed to be seeing.  This is a very subtle film, and all the more scary because if its subtlety. Now shall we discuss MAD LOVE?", "Another film that puts the basic storyline of Dracula to better use. This time, it's the undead Egyptian priest, I'm-ho-tep (Boris Karloff), who puts the beautiful Helen under his spell. David Manners and Edward Van Sloan both reprise their Dracula roles as the young hero, and the wise old mentor respectively. Van Sloan, who is the only actor to appear in Frankenstein, Dracula and The Mummy, gives his best performance here. Karloff is also quite good as the evil villain, I'm-ho-tep. This remains the only mummy movie that can really be called a suspense film or thriller rather than a monster movie. It's not quite as good as Frankenstein, but it's still one of the better classic horror flicks.", "Having recently seen the 1999 remake, I realized just how powerful Karloff's portrayal of Imhotep/Ardath Bey truly is. Without fancy effects or CGI, without an $80,000,000 budget, with little more than dry-looking make-up, a doleful stare, and that wonderful, lisping voice, Karloff created a monster that will endure long after the rental copies of the remake have shed their metal oxide coatings. Karl Freund, the director, was one of Germany's finest cameramen and this was his first film as a director. Employing the \"less is more\" theory of film-making, he keeps the mummy a very mysterious and deadly creature. Never does the mummy stroll up to someone, working them into a corner to strangle them. No, he just reaches out with his mind, killing people from miles away. Finally, the flashback scene is one of the best, done in \"silent film\" style with music and Karloff supplying a morbid voiceover. Sadly, Universal cut the flashback short before the mummy had a chance to tell about chasing the re-incarnated princess throughout time. Some stills survive and Henry Victor still gets credit as \"The Saxon Warrior\".", "-Throughout the great length of his career, Boris Karloff played a number of horror cinema's most memorable characters. But I've always been of the opinion that his work in Universal's The Mummy is his best.The story in The Mummy is, in many respects, almost identical to Universal's earlier Dracula movie. Exchange a mummy for a vampire and Cairo for Transylvania and the rest is quite comparable. Both movies are basically love stories - regardless of how twisted the \"love\" may seem. Ardath Bay's sole purpose in life (or should that be afterlife) is to resurrect the spirit of his long dead love, Princess Anckesen-Amon. His 3,000 year obsession and devotion is demonstrated in the line, \"Anckesen-Amon, my love has lasted longer than the temple of our gods. No man ever suffered as I did for you.\" The response he receives a few scenes later, \"No. No, I'm alive. I'm young. I won't die. I loved you once, but now you belong with the dead. I am Anckesen-Amon, but I'm somebody else too. I want to live, even in this strange new world\", is heartbreaking.Other obvious and less obvious examples of how the two movies are similar include: the use of religious symbols to repel the monsters, the use of hypnosis, the close-up shots of the eyes, and cast members who play basically the same roles (Edward Van Sloan and David Manners appear in both films in almost identical roles). Finally, a similarity that I've always noticed that I've not read anywhere else concerns the Renfield character from Dracula and poor Ralph Norton in The Mummy. Both become stark-raving, hysterical-laughing, mad lunatics. And whether intentional or not, both assist their respective monsters with their plans \u0096 Renfield by actively helping Dracula and Norton by accidentally bringing the mummy back to life.Karloff is perfect as Imhotep/Ardath Bay. I've said a number of times that Karloff was born to play this role. His slim, long body looks like what I imagine a mummy might look like after 3,000 years in the hot, drying desert. Karloff's face, with the help of Jack Pierce's make-up, looks like it would turn to dust at the slightest touch. And, as most would agree, Karloff's voice has an otherworldly quality that sounds as if it were coming from the grave. Karloff's acting abilities also add to the illusion that he is the mummy. Whether his decision or that of director Karl Freund I don't know, but Karloff gives a very understated performance that is necessary if he is to be believed. The understated performance without wild, exaggerated movements is perfect for a 3,000 year old mummy. His carriage suggests a very fragile being that fears crumbling with any strenuous action. To me, Karloff simply is The Mummy.Every time I watch The Mummy, I'm amazed at how little screen time Karloff has as Imhotep. To think that he spent 8 hours a day getting the full-body mummy treatment only to appear for a few minutes in the final film (and never a full body shot) shows an amazing amount of restraint on the part of Freund. If you're a believer in the \"what's not shown is more frightening that what is\" theory of horror, you'll appreciate Freund's decision. But the few shots where Imhotep does appear are, for me, the definition of movie magic. I'll never forget the first time I saw The Mummy. The scene where Imhotep slowly opens his eye to reveal for the first time that he is alive immediately became (and remains) for me one of the most memorable moments in horror history.", "Talk about crushing out big time on a woman. Boris Karloff's been buried for 3700 years just thinking about Princess Ank-sa-namen and no cold showers where he's been.Maybe I shouldn't be so flip because I do in fact consider The Mummy to be one of the best horror films ever done. Amazingly so because it relies so little on special effects or make-up. You see Boris Karloff in the beginning while he's still in his coffin in his Mummy wrap. Then at the end there are special effects ever so briefly in the final battle with Karloff.Other than that this film relies entirely on the mood and suspense created by director Karl Freund and the performance of Boris Karloff as the tortured soul Im-ho-tep.In 1922 I'm-ho-tep's secret unmarked tomb is found and when young assistant Bramwell Fletcher utters an ancient Egyptian spell, the Mummy gets up and walks out, leaving a stark, raving mad Fletcher.Fast forward ten years, a mysterious man named Ardath Bey tells another expedition where to find the tomb of Princess Ank-sa-namen. Her mummy is raised and put in the Cairo Museum.But that's only the beginning of Ardath Bey/Im-ho-tep's plan. It also involves Zita Johann the daughter of the Governor of the Sudan who is Egyptian on mom's side. She's a collateral descendant of the princess and feels drawn to Karloff. She's also drawn to young David Manners and that could put a crimp in Karloff's plans.Boris Karloff probably had his most challenging role here. It's a terribly complex part. We are repulsed by Karloff's scheme, but at the same time the audience feels terribly sorry for what he's been through. While Johann is in a trance, Karloff narrates a flashback sequence to her telling how he was buried alive after she died because he tried to use Egyptian black arts to raise the princess from the dead. What a terrible hurt the man must have felt, and the audience feels it too.The mood is helped in large part by the great orchestrations of James Dietrich of Tschaikovsky themes. Also interpolated in the film background score is the popular ballad Beautiful Love. It creates an aura of unredeemed sadness throughout the film.There is a lot of similarity between The Mummy and that other Universal horror classic Dracula. But Bela Lugosi's Dracula is hardly as sympathetic a figure as Im-ho-tep as played by Boris Karloff. Also Edward Van Sloan as Professor Muller plays the same kind of role in The Mummy as he did as Van Helsing in Dracula.The remakes of The Mummy used a lot of gimmicky special effects to achieve what Boris Karloff did with sheer talent. Personally I still think this version has the power to frighten and entertain.", "Greedy archaeologists in Egypt unearth both a mummified corpse and an ancient scroll which foretells disaster; soon, the mummy has come back to life and wreaks havoc. Deliberately-paced mood piece from Universal hopes to attain the dreamy, surreal qualities attributed to \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\", but the script doesn't have much weight to it. The narrative is thin and the pacing is drowsy for a thriller, though Boris Karloff's presence as the monster certainly gives the picture a boost. Directing debut for Karl Freund who, the year before, was the cinematographer on \"Dracula\"; he knows a great deal about atmosphere, but a livelier touch within the scenario--an offer of suspense for the audience--might have been even more successful. Followed by a slew of unofficial sequels; remade in 1959 and 1999. **1/2 from ****", "Boris Karloff stars in the title role of this well regarded Universal horror favourite. He plays Imhotep, who is resurrected in modern day Egypt and who goes about seeking the reincarnation of his long ago love. That woman is Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann), a half- English / half-Egyptian woman who is also romantically pursued by Frank Whemple (David Manners), son of archaeologist Sir Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron).Stylishly directed by cameraman Karl Freund, \"The Mummy\" is a master work in under statement. You won't see a bandage clad Karloff slooowly shamble after his intended victims, a clich\u00e9 originated in subsequent mummy movies. The film is mostly noteworthy for the actors' subtle, chilling villainy, and his excellent makeup by the talented Jack P. Pierce (who goes uncredited). Johanns' exotic beauty is utilized well, and overall the cast is very fine indeed. It's always a treat to see Edward Van Sloan in these Universal horrors; here he plays Sir Josephs' associate Dr. Muller. Young Bramwell Fletcher has the memorable role, and performance, as the foolish, headstrong man who puts into motion the means of resurrecting Imhotep; he also has the films' most memorable line of dialogue. Noble Johnson, as a servant referred to only as The Nubian, has a powerful screen presence.Solid atmosphere is a heavy asset, as well as some believable sets created by Willy Pogany. And Imhotep is one of those villains whom you can't entirely hate, because everything he's doing, he's doing in the name of love.Seven out of 10.", "What director Karl Freund achieves in this movie is nothing short of staggering, even at a remove of nearly 70 years. If this same story, with this same basic approach, were released today, it would still be great. And especially now, when the box office successes of such movies as The Sixth Sense, What Lies Beneath and The Blair Witch Project demonstrate that audiences are hungry for a return to the classic horror virtues of style, mood and suspense (as opposed to the tired formula of gore, in your face shocks, special effects, and more gore) The Mummy would seem ripe for some kind of revival (too bad the lame Brendan Fraser vehicle has stolen its title - though nothing of its wit, skill, or conviction).What makes this movie so good is. . . gosh, there are so many things! Start with the creepy and unsettling tone, which the movie establishes right away. The very first scene - where the Mummy is awakened - is one of the greatest ever for pure atmosphere and chills. Look at the way Freund *under* plays it, every step of the way. Instead of piling on a crescendo of \"scary\" music and using odd or distorted camera angles to dramatize the situation, he has the action play out in total silence and with a resolutely still camera, the tasteful cut-aways (from the mummy in the tomb to the archaeologist sitting not five feet away) being the only frill. The tension which results is unsettlingly powerful - and is made moreso by the fact that the scene refuses to resolve itself in the way which we expect it to. I'll give no more details, but when you watch the film, ask yourself: isn't *this* resolution ten times more creepy and effective than the one we thought we saw coming. Already, five minutes in, it's clear that The Mummy has a far more wicked, sophisticated sense of horror than any of the other big \"monsters\" of the day (Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, etc.) - and a good deal more than many that have come after, too.But of course, all the style in the world ultimately cannot save a weak or hackneyed script.  And so it's a great pleasure to report that all of Freund's technical finesse is at the service of a really super cool story. Not content to be merely a spooker, the film is also - nay, one might even say primarily - a tragic love story: one that deals intelligently with such provocative notions as forbidden love, reincarnation, religious desecration, inhuman torture, and a strong sub-theme of the desire to respect the past vs. the need to live for the moment. All of these elements swirl so ingeniously and non-didactically in The Mummy's streamlined storyline, that I'm tempted to proclaim this at once both the most compact, as well as the most ambitious, horror movie script I have ever come across.Of course, such superlatives can get you in trouble too, so let me add that yes, there are flaws - mainly the ones endemic to all horror movies of the time. The so-called \"hero\" is once again a young man of no charm or interest whatsoever. Meanwhile, the venerable old \"expert\" who must explain the ways of the monster to everyone else is already a tired convention at this point - and since the role here is played by Edward Van Sloan (who was Van Helsing in the original \"Dracula\" and  its sequel \"Dracula's Daughter\", as well as Dr. Waldman in \"Frankenstein\") there is an even greater than usual sense of perfunctoriness to the undertaking. However, even here the movie displays its strength and uniqueness by toying with our expectations of what these stock characters will be able to do and achieve. Whereas in most other horror films, the romantic lead and the crusty old doctor end up being the white knights who vanquish the monster and save the girl, here they operate on a much less exalted plane - and are thereby made more human in the process.As for faults, that's pretty much it. The pace is masterful; some have called it slow, but I strongly disagree. The film flows naturally and inevitably, with every scene building upon the one before it. There's nothing extraneous in the way it unfolds - achievement enough when compared to the countless other horror movies of its day. As an added treat, there is a flashback sequence in the middle of the movie that is a mini-masterpiece all by itself: it has all the fury and grandeur of a D.W. Griffith silent, honed and encapsulated down to its bare essence. It tells the tale of the title character's previous life with an economy and precision that could still serve as a model for filmmakers today. And, well, most of all, the movie has. . . Boris Karloff.I've restricted my discussion of him until the end because his towering greatness is so routinely accepted and understood that it's almost redundant to comment upon it. Also, I wanted to make clear that, though he is the film's chief asset, he is far from its only one. But there's no question that it is his stately, brooding, menacing performance that ultimately pushes this film over into the realm of greatness. The key thing here is this: while the concept of a centuries-old being raised from the dead and out for vengeance is a great *idea*, Karloff's portrayal is what gives it tangible, terrifying REALITY. Observing this man - with his stiff ramrod posture, his measured and stately movements, and his absolutely hypnotic voice - we are truly convinced, on a visceral level, that yes here indeed is the walking dead. That kind of verisimilitude is rare enough in horror movies of any era, and its presence here stands as an absolute revelation. Just as does the entirety of this wonderful, exquisitely made film.", "The Mummy's place with classic monster movies is down several notches from the likes of Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Wolf Man seeing as the film features very little jolts, a surprisingly slow narrative, and some rather hokey acting by everyone involved. But the film deserves praise for Boris Karloff's unsurprisingly strong performance along with the makeup and set design which make the film an immediate, if minor, success.The story concerns Imhotep (Boris Karloff), an ancient Egyptian priest who is revived on an archaeological expedition conducted by Joseph Whemple (Arthur Byron), who discovers Imhotep's mummy. Imhotep attempted to resurrect his lover Princess Ankh-es-en-amon, and was mummified alive as a result. Joseph, much to the dismay of his friend Dr. Muller (Edward Van Sloan), reads an ancient Egyptian script that brings Imhotep back to life, which leads to the mummy roaming the area of Cairo to find his long-lost love.Karl Freund's direction here is extremely meticulous - a trait many of these older monster films possessed. Freund's direction is very focused on providing efficient light and specific character placement, which at least shows a distinct level of alertness on part of the filmmaker.If only director Freund and writer John L. Balderston had realized The Mummy was also a monster film instead of solely a slowburn drama. This is the kind of thriller that remembers it is part of the horror genre almost fifteen minutes before it's over, leading to an identifiable panic to try and include some scares before the entire opportunity is missed. Because of this, The Mummy is redundant and not very frightening or even remotely eerie.As a drama and a parable about revisiting and tampering with history, I'll say The Mummy succeeds on that level. Universal monster movies seemed to always include some sort of realization or moral and this one in particular kind of keeps the film together and makes its existence as a drama more justifiable. However, marketed and released like a monster film, this poises an odd issue. When we have a film with its title character occupying roughly two minutes in the film, than this is a problem.However, when we do see the mummy, the film becomes a bit more satisfying. Karloff's makeup job is extraordinary, and his acting, throughout the whole film, is the glue of the film. I don't critique acting much because I feel a good story is made by much more than such a thing, and to waste time by saying \"this guy was good, this guy was bad\" makes for a lame, overly-subjective, general review. But Karloff works in the regard that he is a natural screen presence. His modesty (such as saying that anyone could've done his job in Frankenstein) only makes him shine more.The Mummy is an interesting piece of history, well-directed, mostly well-acted, but falls short of monster movie standards due to its lame expository and reliance on drama rather than on tone and exemplified eeriness.Starring: Boris Karloff, Arthur Byron, and Edward Van Sloan. Directed by: Karl Freund.", "I'm a big nerd, I find analytics interesting regarding my viewing activity and I noticed that I had nothing at all from 1932 so The Mummy was a welcome addition.This is where The Mummy franchise truly began and was essentially where The Mummy (1999) came from.Starring original horror icon Boris Karloff as Imhotep the mummy who returns from the grave seeking the reincarnation of his beloved this is where it all began but did it deliver early on?For me The Mummy is a mixed bag. Yes it was highly original for it's time and looks surprisingly good but the performances are lacking and the finale is blunt and very poorly constructed.I'll give it this, it's considerably better than it's 2017 remake which was a true embarassment that took a simple concept and turned it into overblown Hollywood garbage.A classic, but not overly enjoyable (For me at least)The Good:Looks incredible considering its ageThe Bad:Acting has certainly improved since the 1930'sSudden endingThings I Learnt From This Movie:Though the body rots, eyes stay perfectly intactEven in the humble beginnings of horror cinema, the pets still had to die", "Discovering an ancient Egyptian queen's long-lost tomb, a group of archaeologists find that a local's special interest in their find is due to his belief that a local woman is the reincarnated soul of his long-lost love and race to stop him from carrying out his nefarious plans.This is one of the few classic films that is not as great as it's reputation. The reason for it's classic fate is solely based on the resurrection sequence, with the setting, the lighting, the dread emerged from it and the whole way it proceeds to play out is the large part of it's success. From the warning against reading to the actual reading of the tomes, to the single eye that subtly opens and stares out, it really just sends a chill that resonates incredible strongly. The slowly flickering arm beneath the bandages adds a whole second dimension and creepiness to it, and the conclusion is still utterly powerful and full of suspense. It's effective in it's simplicity, and that is one of the best features of the film. The Egyptian sequence is also quite fun, and the way it works through the historical connections throughout the ages makes for some incredibly fun times here showing the manner in which he gets caught and then mummified for his troubles that has a lot to like here makes it all that much better. However, these two factors, along with being one of Karloff's most memorable and well-played roles at the time, is about all for this one as it's really an overrated film. The fact that the film plays more like a romance film and not a horror film is a big part of that. There's really a small amount of scenes that can possibly be classified as being suspenseful, and those are so rare in the film that it's mostly played quite bland. The sequences in the museum should've been, but there's really nothing there to really call it suspenseful when it's all mostly off-screen. The fact that most of the film is a series of sequences following the romantic exploits of the leads is another helping factor, and they don't really belong in the film. It keeps the focus away from the title villain, who really should've had more of a say in the way the events unfold which manages to really focus in on a few areas which show this. Even the fact that the mummy appears on- screen for no more than five minutes, and none of them involve actually fulfilling it's destiny. That also puts one more nail in the coffin: this is mistakenly made out as the starter of the mummy genre. There was two small factors that hurt that. The basic premise for this was taken from another film, and that there are hardly any signs at all of the standard trademarks of the mummy genre. This really wasn't all that great of a film.Today's Rating/PG: Violence.", "If you come into The Mummy (1932) expecting either a cheesy horror flick about a slow-moving, bandaged killer or an Indiana Jones-esque adventure, then you'll be sorely disappointed. If you come in without an appreciation for atmosphere and subtle storytelling, then yes, you will not get why this is such a highly regarded film.The Mummy stands apart from most of the other Universal horrors with its slow, dreamlike quality. Some complain that nothing happens in this film, but that is only because they are looking at the surface. Really, what's happening inside of the characters' heads is more fascinating than any generic horror movie killing spree could be. The reincarnation love story is interesting and the conflict between the ancient and modern world within the heroine Helen makes for good drama.Karloff's performance as the menacing but sympathetic Imhotep is one of his finest characterizations. Though the character and the movie overall are often compared to Dracula (1931), I think Imhotep has more in common with the 1925 Phantom of the Opera in that he is a grotesque figure out to claim the romantic love of a woman he feels he deserves.I believe Zita Johann as Imhotep's beloved Helen deserves special mention too, for unlike most Universal damsels, she gets a role with depth and plays it off beautifully. Unlike say, Mary Philbin's Christine in POTO, Helen is conflicted as to her feelings for Imhotep, whose presence awakens a love from another lifetime within her. And yet, she also loves her life in the modern world and struggles as to whether or not to give it up to resume a relationship cut short centuries ago. Johann underplays it, coming off as more soulful than your garden variety horror movie heroine.Paired with a fine story and fantastic direction from the great Karl Freund, classic horror fans should not go through life without at least two viewings of this wonderful movie. It takes multiple viewings to really grasp the genius at hand.", "Poor David Manners, there was an actor who truly never had a break. Imagine being an actor whose fate was seemingly always to be consigned to playing straight-man to Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. In one film, \"The Black Cat\", he actually would up playing straight-man to both of them!In \"The Mummy\" it was poor Manners' misfortune to be cast opposite Boris Karloff. How can any actor hope to get noticed while sharing the screen with one of the greatest horror icons of all time, especially in what many consider to be one of Karloff's roles? Granted that, after 80 years, some aspects of the movie may creak a bit. However, there's no getting around the fact that time has detracted absolutely nothing from Karloff's performance.It is interesting to compare the 1932 version of \"The Mummy\" with the 1999 version, because the differences in style and production emphasis are so striking. The modern version is all about CGI special effects and roller-coaster paced action. The 1932 version is all about setting an eerie mood and, of course, the sheer charismatic presence of Boris Karloff.In Frankenstein Karloff played The Monster as a heavy, hulking, stumbling mute. Yet how different he seems in The Mummy. Yes, there are scenes in which the actor was wrapped up and heavily made up to simulate a 3,700-year-old mummy. By all accounts that was a very unpleasant experience for the actor, too. However, in most of the movie Karloff was dressed in a sort of full-length gown, emphasizing the actor's tall and spare frame, further implying the notion that he is a 3,700-year-old re-animated mummy. Nevertheless, the actor's performance was not limited to makeup and costume. Further accentuating the idea of a walking corpse is the subtle manner in which Karloff moved, or should one more precisely say, didn't move. Karloff's mummy moved very slowly, almost gliding; and when he stood he stood very still, moving his body as little as possible. The overall effect of that stillness was to make Karloff's mummy seem even more powerful and menacing. Another notable difference was that, unlike in Frankenstein, in \"The Mummy\" Karloff got a chance to make use of that wonderfully sibilant, purring voice of his; that unique voice that has put chills up generations of spines, and still continues to do so.It is also worth noting that Karl Freund's direction was a textbook example to aspiring modern horror film directors of how less can be so much more. The initial scene in which Karloff's mummy becomes alive, opening his eyes slightly and slowly moving one hand just a little bit, still has the power to chill. So does that the subsequent scene, in which all that is visible to the viewer are a couple of bandages moving slowly along the floor and trailing out of the door. Nothing is more frightening than the imagination and, in that classic scene, Freund demonstrated exactly how far a little bit of suggestion can go.", "A lot of people sincerely love this film and I do appreciate its relevance, but I didn't find it to be as great as most people do. I guess it's mostly because I thought it would be an entire movie centering on well, a mummy. Instead, we actually got to see the so called mummy acting like a normal human most of the time. It's just not what I was expecting. I still liked it of course. It's mostly because of how good the performances are, especially with Boris Karloff. I'll give it credit for being different than I thought it would be. It was nice to be surprised by this.Yeah, it was more boring than the other films. The \"Frankenstein\" ones are of course the best of the Universal Horror films. I think this film's length worked quite well too. The sets are a very strong point. The very first part with the opening credits might be the best as they really create great visuals and set up the mood perfectly. The mood is obviously what makes this so good. While not one of my favorites, it still holds up well with its tone. ***", "I loved this horror film. Even by today's standards, the makeup for Boris Karloff as the Mummy was perfect. With today's fantastic special effects, it is possible to do BIG and EXCITING special effects, but the subtlety and believability (or at least as close as you'll get for this type of movie) make this a great film. Add to that, excellent acting, a tight script and wonderful cinematography (possibly the best of any of the Universal horror films) and you've got the ingredients for one of the greatest classic horror films.I should point out that almost a decade later, Universal Studios revived the films and created a new Mummy series. These are not related to the Karloff film but are entertaining B-movies. All Mummy movies I've seen that have been made since I found to be lacking--I love the old stuff best. Mostly because the newest films provide lots of special effects but really lack when it comes to story and acting,...and fun!UPDATE: I just watched this film again (5/10) and was amazed with the great Egyptian details. The look of the artifacts were great and the people making this film obviously worked hard to get the look and names right.", "Given enough time and interest, I'm sure that I would have gotten around to the original Universal version of \"The Mummy\", but the hideous (in every respect) 1999 remake is the straw that broke the camel's back. The second I happened to see the original (complete with poster art) on the shelves of my local Wal-Mart, there were no second thoughts. It HAD to be better than that low-grade (though high budget)\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" ripoff I spent two hours suffering through. Thankfully, my impulse proved to be on the money.I really look at this film as Karloff's first piece of proof that there was more to his talent than Frankenstein's monster. Imhotep (aka Ardeth Bay) couldn't be more different than that sweet-natured brute. Though both are pathetic in their own way and lonely, Imhotep is more intelligent and a great deal more malicious by far. He's willing to do anything, kill anyone, and break any taboo to be reunited with his lost love. Karloff never has to raise his voice to convey menace; just a hardening of the eyes or a steely tone in that oh-so-distinct voice of his is enough to make you a little uneasy.An overlooked aspect of this film is that, in a way, it's something of a tragedy. Imhotep has literally sacrificed everything he ever had just to be by the side of his beloved princess. So focused on this goal is he that he doesn't realize the great harm he is doing to all those around him, including to his beloved (who, in a thankful break with movie tradition at the time, proves to be the undoing of the immortal monster). I feel more of a sense of relief at film's end than triumph. Maybe now Imhotep can rest in peace.", "Boris Karloff follows up his exceptional 1931 performance as the Frankenstein Monster the following year in another Universal horror hit, \"The Mummy\". In the film, Karloff portrays not only the title character Imhotep, but also his modern day counterpart Ardath Bey, whose mission is to reunite with his long lost love Princess Anck-Es-En-Amon.It was the 1921 British Museum Field Expedition that discovered the Mummy's remains along with the Scroll of Thoth, whose mystic message contains a spell that can raise the dead. When expedition member Norton (Bramwell Fletcher) unseals the scroll, the Mummy slowly comes to life in a sequence designed to create nightmares in young children and shivers in the timid. Fletcher's descent into madness is conveyed by a maniacal rant as his mind fails to accept what his eyes are showing him. His response to expedition leader Sir Joseph Whemple - \"He went for a little walk, you should have seen his face\".Fast forward to 1932, Sir Joseph and son Frank return to Egypt, and aided by Ardath Bey, discover the tomb of Imhotep's lost love of 3700 years prior. In ritual prayer, Bey summons the spirit of Anck-Es-En-Amon to seek life in the body of Helen Grosvenor. As Helen slowly succumbs to her new identity, Imhotep uses his mystical powers to remove his opposition, willing Sir Joseph's demise and nearly doing the same to Frank. In an illuminating sequence, it's revealed how Imhotep came to be buried alive for his sacrilege of stealing the sacred Scroll of Thoth, and memorizing it's prohibited secrets.For fans of classic horror and Universal monsters in particular, the names of Frankenstein, Dracula and Wolf Man will always remain the big three, but that in no way can lessen the importance of \"The Mummy\" when it comes to one's must see list. Boris Karloff would have been considered legendary for either one of his signature characters, to have portrayed both Frankenstein and The Mummy so effectively is significant testimony to his \"monstrous\" talent."], "tt0023247": ["A woman and her fianc\u00e9 travel to get her father's blessing on their up coming marriage. In tow is another couple. The father, a professor and inventor is working on am invention which will make unlimited power from sunlight. Arriving at the house as a thunderstorm threatens to break the quartet find themselves in the middle of a murder.This is yet another old dark house movie with secret passages, dark cloaked figures, weird science and lots of mysterious people lurking around. Both better and worse than many similar films from the period this movie is worth a shot for those who like this sort of thing.Graced with a game cast including Jack Mulhall and Misha Auer this is a good looking film with some nice smart ass dialog. It looks and feels like your typical old dark house movie of the period with very little of the periods creakiness. The film keeps things moving and lively in a way that many films from the period don't (they also use enough sound that you don't notice the lack of music).The film however is far from perfect. The main problem is really split into two parts. First there are way way too many characters wandering around the grounds. Its simply too many for the story to sustain. I think there are 11 characters at the house, many of which are little more than faces that stand in the shadow or pass by the windows. Until the final denouncement we have no idea who these people are. Related to that this film simply has too much going on. Characters are spread out all over the place and its hard to tell who is doing what or why. And again, until the final denouncement we're never really sure what is going on, its a bunch of people staggering around an old dark house.Recommended for those who like old dark house films and are a bit forgiving in their tastes. Others may like it but find it too slow and confused for their tastes.FYI: IMDb lists this as being 62 minutes long however the version from Alpha Video that I saw ran about 10 minutes shorter. I'm not sure if that part of the reason things are confused or not. I somehow think not.", "The second recorded deployment of Kenneth Strickfaden's fabulous fantasy lab equipment (following the original Frankenstein), is the sole element apt to please viewers of this wearisome essay at creating an Old Dark House mystery, wherein stabs taken toward comedy and suspense are less than persuasive, and production values in this low-budget affair are anaemic. Danny (Jack Mulhall) and Doris (Josephine Dunn), in order to avoid a stall in their marriage plans, entrain with married chums Freddie (Eddie Boland) and Gertrude (Marjorie Beebe) to the mountain hermitage of Dr. Farrington, inventor father of Doris, to gain his consent for their wedding, and on a dark and stormy night (as can be noted from repeated footage of identical flashes of lightning), with the film striving for a general atmosphere of malevolence, the quartet arrives at Farrington's aerie. Meanwhile, the doctor is seen demonstrating his latest brainchild, a \"VXO Accumulator\", to a visiting colleague, Judge Folger, a contrivance that will purportedly mine the sun's rays for the development of free power that will benefit mankind, but as the device might also be utilized for evil, the stage is set for harrowing proceedings. These include Folger's murder, along with the kidnapping of Farrington, all while the bewildered young couples try to stay out of harm's way from such as secret passages and trap doors, disappearing corpses, a sinister caretaker played by Mischa Auer (complete with maniacal cackling laughter), in addition to two other men who skulk about the grounds (one of whom is dropped, unidentified as to name or purpose, by the script); notwithstanding these melodramatic events, the film is bare of moments that may be interesting to a sensate viewer. In truth, from its very beginning, this is a poor film, and even with the surfeit of ominous occurrences tossed at us, the work is so substandard that a viewer eventually is resigned to merely studying the sequences to wonder at examples of what are not only distinctly tedious goings-on but risible as well, the script, direction, acting, and editing being as atrocious as can be imagined.", "The archetype of every character from this formula plot is there, from the eccentric scientist, the vulnerable heroine (who happens to be his daughter), her heroic fianc\u00e9e, the comical drunken sidekick, dour housekeeper (is there any other kind?), stereotypical black porter, and all sorts of other mysterious and nefarious characters who pop in and out of the storyline.Try not to laugh at the presence of the very serious Martha Mattox as the housekeeper; At one point, while holding a candle, she highly resembles \"Young Frankenstein's\" Frau Brucher, and when she breaks out into an evil grin, looks like \"Alice in Wonderland's\" Cheshire Cat. Mischa Auer steals every moment he is on as the man of mystery, clad much like Bela Lugosi and given some sinister dialog.When the heroine, played by Josephine Dunn, is suddenly confronted by the dark Auer and doesn't instantly break into hysterics (after having already done so in other scenes), the screenplay hits its nadir. Eddie Boland, as the drunken pal of hero Jack Mulhall, is not only afraid of his own shadow, but of the shadows of tree branches as well, and no amount of booze in his system can give him any amount of liquid courage.The use of scientific equipment, apparently also used in the earlier \"Frankenstein\" (and later in \"Bride of Frankenstein\") really has no point in being there, the bulk of the chills coming from the creepy servants who slither around the cheap set as if they had just been thrown off of \"The Old Dark House\".", "...or else what would actors like Josephine Dunn and Jack Mulhall have done??? A lot of the interest in these type of films is the cast list - whatever happened to such and such , only the year before they were on top of the heap. Unfortunately for Josephine Dunn there were no such memories. Her main claim to fame rests with playing the meanie in \"The Singing Fool\". Then she was the third maiden in \"Our Modern Maidens\" (1929) but the other two were Joan Crawford and Anita Page, so she wasn't left with much to do other than be nasty to poor Joan!! She was then in \"Safety in Numbers\" (1930) with Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, unfortunately she was overshadowed by Carole Lombard and Virginia Bruce, so it was on to the quickies. Jack Mulhall did have a career - he co- starred with Alice White in \"Naughty Baby\" and \"Showgirl in Hollywood\" but by 1932 was firmly entrenched as a reliable actor on poverty row.Doris (Josephine Dunn) and Danny (Jack Mulhall) are visiting Doris' father to get his consent to their marriage. He lives in the mountains and is working on a new invention. Doris is worried as she hasn't heard from him for a while. There are strange goings on at the house, with a creepy housekeeper (Martha Mattox, looking exactly like she did in \"The Cat and Canary\" (1927)) and a sinister caretaker, Henry (Mischa Auer - what would Hollywood have done without him!!!). Doris' father has created a solar powered form of electricity that will cut costs!!The night that Doris and Danny arrive, along with their friends Gertrude (Marjorie Beebe) and Freddie (Eddie Boland) other people turn up as well (a judge and other unexplained people). As usual with these \"old dark house\" movies, people have a habit of turning up dead!!! It seems that Henry has been building a laboratory of his own and he wants the good doctor's formula or he will be zapped by his own invention.It is okay - not the best or the worst of these type that I have seen.", "Danny and Doris along with some friends go to Dr. Farrington's house to ask get his consent to marry. Well, once they arrive weird stuff happens...such as finding Farrington and his friend dead...and soon after this discovery the bodies disappear!! What follows is essentially a murder mystery and an old dark house film rolled up into one.As far as the genre goes, this one is fairly good--despite coming from a low-budget studio. However, one thing bothered me and may well bother other viewers--the very ignorant black character. Back in the day, folks thought it was funny featuring a scared black man as comic relief....and this one is no different...except that he's even more ignorant than usual. A sad cliche, I know...but still a decent film despite this.", "Murder at Dawn (1932)** (out of 4)Danny (Jack Mulhall) and Doris (Josephine Dunn) are on their way to tell her father about their engagement but what they don't know is that her father scientist has created a deadly ray that can work off the sun. The father's friend is mysteriously murdered and soon more bodies are piling up as someone tries to steal the secret.MURDER AT DAWN was one of the numerous \"old dark house\" movies that were produced in the 1930s. This one here features lightening, thunder, mysterious shadows, screams in the night, a nutty scientist, murder and of course an annoying lead couple who go for laughs. If you've seen at least two of these then you already know what's going on in these types of movies as there are countless suspects and out of no where one pops up at the end as the killer. Rarely do these films make any sense so it takes something really special happening in order for them to stand out in the pack.Sadly, nothing too special happens here as there are way too many characters introduced to us and none of them really stand out in an entertaining way. All the stereotypes are in full force here and I must admit that it was rather hard following the film because it's so uneven. The performances range from fair to decent but, again, nothing really stands out. MURDER AT DAWN isn't horrible and it's mildly entertaining but it's mainly going to appeal to those who want to see all of these sub-genre movies that were made.", "Now, \"Murder at Dawn\" perhaps may not suit the tastes of a highbrow who demands a perfect production and direction and an answer to everything - but it's a very stunning, atmospheric and VERY much underrated B movie, with all the elements of a classic 'isolated mansion' mystery: complete with a thunderstorm, shady types creeping through the garden at night and peeping into windows, a mysterious housekeeper (Martha Mattox, well known to fans of the genre from \"The Cat and the Canary\" and \"Murder by the Clock\"), turning fireplaces, bodies in the closet, and so on...It's also got its 'scientific' element (which constitutes the reason for all the murderous ongoings): an inventor is working in the seclusion of this old house on a device for producing electricity, which could of course be very important for the future of mankind, but also very dangerous...But the entertainment isn't neglected either in this charmingly old-fashioned 'cheapie': there's romance in the shape of the inventor's daughter (Josephine Dunn) and her fianc\u00e9, played by Jack Mulhall - and also a comical side, which is handled very nicely by the 'old' married couple Marjorie Beebe and Eddie Boland. And a very special surprise: Mischa Auer in a VERY unusual role as the strange and sinister caretaker - you'll have to look twice to recognize him!For friends of the good old 30s' mysteries, an absolute 'must' - it catches the mood and atmosphere just as well as the much more famous classics of the same time, like \"The Old Dark House\" or \"The Bat Whispers\"!", "My idea of torture, which might perhaps be inflicted upon terrorist suspects in order to make them scream and divulge their confederates, would be to tie them down, prop open their eyelids with those tools used by optic surgeons, and force them to watch this film. Richard Thorpe directed it, and later he learned how to direct, as proved by 'A Toy Wife' six years later, but at this early stage in what was to be a long career (offering him plenty of time to go to confession and tell some holy father that he had committed the sin of directing 'Murder at Dawn' abominably), he seemed to imagine that film direction was something one does with a knife in a butcher shop, serving up the offal to the masses, of which this is a misshapen specimen. To pretend that this is a film is like pretending that an ant is an elephant. Of course, everything is relative. After all, to a flea, an ant is an elephant. And similarly, to Richard Thorpe in 1932, this presumably did appear to be a film. But we who live in later times are not fooled: this is unmistakably a piece of rubbish.", "I guess if there weren't films as bad as this one we wouldn't be able to tell what a good one looked like. This is as muddled as they come with a cast of characters that resemble those metallic spheres in a pinball machine, bouncing all over the place and accomplishing nothing. Someone like Charlie Chan might have been able to reign in the players on the way to solving the murder mystery at the heart of this story, but without that calming effect, it looked like it was every man (and woman) for themselves.Another reviewer on this board described Professor Farrington's (Frank Ball) invention as the VXO Accumulator; I thought I heard DXL Accumulator. It doesn't make any difference. The gizmo was supposed to be able to harness unlimited power from the sun, thereby 'setting millions of wage slaves free'. I thought about that for a while, trying to imagine what a million freed wage slaves would do then, and came to the conclusion that they'd be even worse off. Now they wouldn't even have slave wages coming in.Considering that we had a murdered judge and a kidnapped professor to worry about, things got just a little too frantic here for my taste. A lot of scurrying about aimlessly and unidentified characters peering in through windows and around corners with no purpose that I could figure out. Presumably the crazy caretaker (Mischa Auer) had designs on stealing the Professor's secret formula that made his invention work, but things came to an end when he hit the pavement, literally. Fortunately, the run time for this flick was about a full ten minutes shy of the sixty two minutes described on the DVD sleeve. That added a bonus point to my rating for the picture.", "There is only one reason to watch this film: Eddie Boland as Freddie. And possibly for Gertrude (Marjorie Beebe), Freddie's wise cracking wife.I caught this on YouTube (Hastings Mystery Theater) and watched out of curiosity as the host Randall Scheafer discussed Big Four Productions. The major studios had bought up most theaters in insure their pictures would be seen. But the independent theater owners still needed films. Small production produced films on the cheap: spend a lot less on sets and extras and anything else you could cut. That's how a picture like Murder at Dawn gets made. And if you watch, you can \"clearly\" see the result.There is an amusing exchange between the four stars and George Reed ( a fine African-American actor) that relies on stereotypes, but you can't deny Reed's comedic timing.The plot is as silly as the opening screen credits: a \"mad\" scientist creates a power source that could provide free electricity to the \"wage slaves,\" but faces a foe bent on stealing his invention. The twist is the heroine, her fianc\u00e9, and friends are going to see the scientist because he is the heroine's father and she wants his blessing. Forget the plot, everything will eventually work out. But the banter between Freddie and Gertrude is blistering. And Freddie solo screens as he tipples his way along provide some terrific laughs, or at least chuckles."], "tt0023249": ["THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE (Universal, 1932), directed by Robert Florey, and suggested on the story by Edgar Allan Poe, became Universal's third installment in its horror cycle (following two 1931 releases of \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein.\" Top-billing goes to Sidney Fox, a short, dark-haired beauty with innocent charm, but the scene stealing goes to Bela Lugosi in a very creepy and scary performance.Set in 1845 Paris, Pierre Dupin (Leon Waycoff), a young medical student, with his fianc\u00e9e, Camille L'Espanaye (Sidney Fox), attend a carnival where they enter a tent to watch a side show featuring Doctor Mirakle (Bela Lugosi) with his pet ape, Erik. Mirakle demonstrates his friendship with his ape by speaking his language, etc., and tells his mesmerizing audience that the ape's blood can be mixed with that of the blood of man. While many in view feel him to be insane, Pierre does not. Mirakle later makes an acquaintance with Camille, and noticing that Erik is particularly interested in her, Mirakle finds she may possibly be the perfect choice as the bride for his gorilla. As the story progresses, bodies of street girls are found in the river and taken by authorities to the Rue Morgue where Pierre decides to study these unfortunate victims of drowning, only to soon learn the motive for these recent deaths, and hoping to put a stop to it before any more murders occur.Combining horror and mystery, THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, running only 60 minutes in length, reportedly did not become a box office success, maybe because of some scenes that were possibly too intense for 1932 audiences, but in spite of some intrusive \"comedy relief,\" this atmospheric movie does have its bonuses, especially that of Lugosi, sporting curly hair, bushy eyebrows, glassy eyes and red lips that make him every bit as creepy as he did playing Dracula a year ago. The scene where he leisurely approaches a prostitute (Arlene Francis) in the heavy fog of night after her \"lovers\" have a knife fight to the death, speaks to her in saying slowly, \"A lady ... in distress .... Come ... with me.\" The way he says this is pure Lugosi not only scaring his proposed victim, but his viewers as well. What occurs after he takes her with him to his place is not for the squeamish. D'Arcy Corrigan also adds some nice touches of horror in the story as the morgue keeper. He is not the villain, but his appearance in itself is stereotype undertaking at best. He looks more like the walking dead himself. The funny thing here is that he tells Pierre that he has a wife and children. One can imagine what they look like, but we'll never know.If the voice of Leon Waycoff sounds familiar and not his name, Waycoff later changed his surname from Waycoff to Ames. Leon Ames is famous for his role as Judy Garland's father in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (MGM, 1944), and playing fathers in many other film and TV roles. Also in the cast are Bert Roach as Paul; Brandon Hurst as the Prefect of Police; Betsy Ross Clark as Camille's mother; and Noble Johnson as Mirakle's assistant, Janos, who says nothing but whose facial gestures also add to the creepiness.Pierre Dupin, the medical student turned sleuth, would turn up again in another Universal film, THE MYSTERYOF MARIE ROGET (1942) with Patric Knowles as Dupin, Nell O'Day as Camille and Marie Montez as the title character. As for THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, it was formerly shown on both the Sci-Fi Channel and American Movie Classics cable channels prior to 2001, and later Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: August 18, 2006). Formerly on video cassette and later on DVD, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, is satisfactory nightmarish entertainment, especially for any avid Bela Lugosi fan. (***)", "... and it probably wouldn't be remembered at all if not for Bela Lugosi being second billed as Dr. Mirakle and Leon Ames (so early in his career he is still going by Leon Waykoff) as Pierre Dupin, a medical student. And yet it is on DVD!Dr. Mirakle is a mad scientist, and he meets Pierre and more importantly his girlfriend Camille (Sidney Fox) at a circus sideshow where Dr. Mirakle claims he can talk to his gorilla, Eric, and that the gorilla is lonely. It is obvious Mirakle wants Camille to be Eric's \"girlfriend\", but she is difficult to get close to. So he continues trying - and failing - with prostitutes, who are easily abducted. and not missed. He injects gorilla blood into their blood, probably in an attempt to turn them into gorilla like creatures as a companion for Eric, but the experiment always fails and the girls die. Dr. Mirakle blames the failures on the girls' \"sins\". There were some things that you couldn't come out and say even in the precode era, and what he is probably trying to say is that he needs the blood of a virgin - enter Camille. Mirakle's assistant dumps the bodies into the Seine. That is where Dupin comes back into the picture as he is frequenting the Rue Morgue where their bodies end up, and is trying to determine the cause of death.The dialogue is pedestrian, and so is the acting. Only Lugosi comes alive at all. And there are some really obvious shots of a man in a gorilla suit that is supposed to be Eric and repetitive close up shots of the gorilla himself that do not impress. What does impress is the set design. It is very detailed and interesting and worth a look. Plus there are a couple of scenes, that, if it wasn't for the fact that King Kong came out a year later, I would swear were stolen from that more famous film.Probably for fans of Lugosi and of interesting and atmospheric set design only.", "A crazed scientist commits vile MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE to promote his theories concerning the relationship between human & ape biology.Bela Lugosi dominates this rather fascinating little foray into terror, his mad mesmerizing eyes & theatrical gestures a natural complement to the film's Grand Guignol qualities. Listening to the world of weariness in his voice as he delivers a line like `Will my search never end?' makes only more poignant this fine actor's eventual descent into drug addicted obscurity.Pert, pretty little Sidney Fox -she actually receives top billing over Lugosi - gives a pleasing performance as the unfortunate choice of the ape's interest (the plot is never really clear as to what, exactly, Lugosi is attempting to accomplish with his gruesome experiments). Leon Waycoff is hopeless as a romantic lead, but with an eventual name change to Leon Ames, he was to become one of Hollywood's most durable character actors.The supporting cast is quite good: plump Bert Roach as a nervous medical student; sepulchral D'Arcy Corrigan as a sardonic morgue keeper; Arlene Francis, who has the dubious honor of featuring in one of Universal's most horrific murder scenes; and Noble Johnson, important Black actor & silent film star, here performing in whiteface (as he often did) as Lugosi's mute henchman.Movie mavens will spot some familiar faces in unbilled roles: Harry Holman as Miss Fox's silly, obese landlord; Herman Bing, Torben Meyer & Agostino Borgato as three ear-witnesses to one of the murders; Tempe Pigott as an old crone with very bad teeth; and Charlotte Henry as a lovely young lady.Based somewhat loosely on the classic detective story by Edgar Allan Poe, the film also owes much in plot to Leroux' The Phantom of the Opera and in style to Wiene's THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. Karl Freund's cinematography is first rate, as is the expressionistic set design by Herman Rosse, with buildings tilted or leaning at crazed angles. The contribution of master makeup artist Jack Pierce is also evident.", "Murders In The Rue Morgue casts Bela Lugosi as one of the many mad scientists he played in his long career. To make ends meet he has a carnival act, but it's really a blind for some gruesome experiments involving sex. InterSpecies sex that is.If Charles Darwin is correct and man is related to the other primates than it follows, reasons Bela apes should be looking to mate with man given the proper stimulation. So for his horny gorilla he kidnaps women and injects them with simian blood. In the Paris of 1845 Bela's experiments are working pretty good as his ape is let loose on these injected women and the young women of Paris are in danger. Women of all classes as streetwalker Arlene Francis discovers to her tragic regret.King Kong never eyed Fay Wray with more lust than Bela's simian had when he was checking out Sidney Fox. In fact King Kong should prove the hypothesis Lugosi was advancing. The climax of Murders At The Rue Morgue is very similar to King Kong with Leon Ames playing the Bruce Cabot part.Some really great sets and beautiful cinematography are the main attraction of Murders At The Rue Morgue which bares only the slightest resemblance to Edgar Allan Poe's story. Lugosi is fabulously sinister and lustful, he's checking out Fox and the others himself. It's not Dracula for him, but what is?", "After the enormous success of Tod Browning's \"Dracula\" in 1931, producer Carl Laemmle Jr. finally proved that his vision had been correct and that the horror genre was an excellent source of stories to film. With that in mind, he began to work immediately in a follow up for that success with an adaptation of Mary Shelley's immortal novel, \"Frankenstein\", in the expressionist Gothic style of Browning's film. The film was set to be written and directed by French director Robert Florey and starred by the recently discovered Hungarian star of \"Dracula\": Bela Lugosi. However, people at Universal changed the plans and assigned the film to British director James Whale, who had a different idea for the movie and replaced Lugosi with Boris Karloff. Owing a film to both Florey and Lugosi, Universal gave them a project based on a tale by Edgar Allan Poe: \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\".Set in Paris during the late 19th Century, \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is the tale of a series of unsolved crimes where women are abducted and murdered by an unknown method. Since the murders began to take place after a carnival arrived to the city, young medicine student Pierre Dupin (Leon Ames) suspects that Dr. Mirakle (Bela Lugosi), a scientist who owns one of the sideshow attractions, is behind the crimes, but so far he finds himself unable to prove it. His suspicion has its source in the fact that Mirakle has claimed to be looking for a way to finally prove that man and ape are related, and apparently has been experimenting on his sideshow attraction: an intelligent ape named Erik, which Mirakle claims is the missing link. Dupin fears that Mirakle's experiments are related to the murders, but the truth is far more horrible than what he thinks.\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is not exactly a faithful adaptation of Poe's short story, as the script (written by Tom Reed, Dale Van Every and Robert Florey himself) focuses more on the reasons behind the murders than on the investigation done to solve the case. It is because of this reason that it is Dr. Mirakle who is in the spotlight while Poe's famous character, Dupin, has been transformed from cunning detective to a young student of medicine. With this change, the writers allow themselves to completely focus on horror, and deliver one of the darkest and most violent stories among Universal's classic horrors. However, as many have already pointed out, the story is not only an exploration of Poe's tale, but also a charming tribute to German expressionism's most celebrated triumph, \"Das Cabinet Des Dr. Caligari\", as the plot mirrors the classic silent film in more than one way.The tribute to \"Caligari\" is not only a part of the script, as director Florey, aided by the legendary cinematographer Karl Freund and the wonderful art direction by Charles D. Hall, extended the tribute to the overall visual look of the film, following the expressionist style to the letter with an amazing use of light and shadows to create a powerful and haunting atmosphere. However, not everything is lifted from German expressionism, as Florey adds his own realist style to the mix resulting in a powerful combination that enhances the violence of the script. As the film was done before the Production Code was introduced, Florey manages to bring to life a lot of the vicious images of the script with an amount of detail that would be impossible a few years later. Sadly, Florey's skills at directing actors aren't as good as his skills with the camera, and some bad performances end up damaging the movie a lot.While Florey doesn't seem to direct his actors as good as he does with the visuals, Bela Lugosi shows off his talent in a tremendous performance that's probably among the best of his career. As Mirakle, Lugosi is incredibly believable as a demented scientist, and despite being one of his most menacing roles he even manages to be sympathetic at times. The sadly ill-fated Sidney Fox is also good as Camille, the damsel in distress of this eerie horror, but sadly her counterpart, Leon Ames, isn't up to the challenge. While he later proved to be a talented actor, in this movie Ames delivers an awful performance that looks stagy and simply out of place in the movie. Bert Roach, who plays his sidekick, is not much better, as his delivery of comic relief is mediocre at best and ludicrous at worst.This varying quality of the performances and the sharp contrast between them and the superb visual look of the movie may had played a part in the relatively disappointing reception the film had at box office, but the main reasons the movie failed was probably the fact that the audience wasn't ready for the dark nature of the plot and the violence displayed on screen. In fact, there are rumors stating that Universal removed almost 20 minutes of the original cut, taking away scenes supposedly too violent for being released. Anyways, whether this rumor is true or not is ultimately irrelevant, as the film's main problem is still in the actors' performances and that's something that missing footage hardly could improve. It is a shame that one of Lugosi's best performances ends up in the same film as one of Ames' worst.Despite its many troubles, Robert Florey's \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is still an effective tale of horror and mystery that keeps the classic Universal feeling to the max. Dark and atmospheric, it is also an unusual movie due to its raw portrayal of violence on film. While not exactly a classic of the level of Universal films like \"Frankenstein\" or \"The Black Cat\", this movie is definitely a must see if only for Karl Freund's masterful cinematography and Bela Lugosi's amazing performance. 7/10", "\"Murders In the Rue Morgue\" was Universal's follow up for star Bela Lugosi after the huge success of \"Dracula\" (1931). He did appear in other films during this period but mostly in minor roles. In fact, in one of the worst career moves of his career, Bela had turned down the role of the monster in \"Frankenstein\" (1931).This film made in 1932, two years before the introduction of the infamous Production Code, contains many situations that would have not been allowed under the Production Code. For example, even the suggestion of a liaison between an ape and a woman would have never been allowed and the clear identification of a prostitute likewise. It's probably why this film was not seen for many years.Lugosi, donning his mad scientist hat, plays the mysterious Dr. Mirakle who works in a carnival sideshow in 1845 Paris. He displays his man-like ape (actually it looks like a full grown chimpanzee) Erik while searching for a human female to presumably mate with the monster. One night pretty Camille L'Espanaye (Sidney Fox) and her beau, medical student Pierre Dupin (Leon Waycoff) visit the carnival and take in Dr. Mirakle's show. During the show, the ape is give the girl's bonnet and becomes obsessed with her.Meanwhile we learn that Mirakle has been searching for the right blood match for his pet. We discover that two women have been murdered (offscreen) already. One dark night, Mirakle comes upon a \"woman of the streets\" (Arlene Francis) who has just witnessed the deaths of two \"suitors\" in a knife fight. The good doctor lures the poor wench to his laboratory where we witness his torture of her and her rather cold disposition of her corpse when she dies after she is injected with the ape's blood.All the while Mirakle has kept his eye on the comely Camille. Then one night he sends the ape to Camille's room and..............The film is well directed by Robert Florey who utilizes Universal's dark fog filled sets to great effect. Lugosi is quite terrifying in this role. Although he did get teamed with Boris Karloff in the mid thirties, he never achieved the heights he should have at Universal. With his personal off screen problems well documented, he made a number of poor choices in his movie roles. During the period when his star should have been rising he kept appearing in cheap poverty row features and serials which did little to advance his career.Others in the cast include Bert Roach as Paul, Pierre's friend, Brandon Hurst as the Prefect of Police and D'Arcy Corrigan as the Morgue Keeper.A very young John Huston contributes some additional dialog for the story. Leon Waycoff became Leon Ames and enjoyed a lengthy career as a character actor.One of Lugosi's best.", "Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932)King Kong was released by RKO in 1933, a story of an ape captured by white hairless apes and brought to a foreign land. And this is exactly the beginning of the 1932 Rue Morgue, as Bela Lugosi, playing Dr. Mirakle, appears as flamboyant sideshow impresario with an ape in a cage. His trick (if it is one) is knowing how to translate ape talk to English (or French, maybe, since we are in Paris). His point is that the apes are us, that evolution is true. \"Can you understand what he says? Or have you forgotten?\" Not the most honorable spokesman for science, no doubt, but he is a mad scientist, and is setting out to create some kind of unexplained human/ape hybrid.The movie is filled with dramatic innovations, and a very high technical standard (for Universal, a minor studio player until this time). And the transfer to DVD is terrific. Ten minutes into the film, Lugosi breaks the fourth wall and looks into the camera to challenge the viewer to accept evolution and its consequences.. (The Scopes trial was 1925, so this is a hot topic.) Watch for the camera attached to the swing about 32 minutes in. There are echoes of Frankenstein (1931) with the madman and his doltish assistant, as well as the angry mobs. And there is Lugosi himself, with all the aura carrying over from his breakthrough in Dracula (also 1931).The cinematography by Karl Freund is totally amazing. There are not astonishing tricks, just consistent, brilliant framing and lighting, scene after scene. (If only he had shot Dracula--oh, he did! Yes...check that out, too.) 1920s German Expressionist films find a true expression here (not Caligari, for sure, but a high water mark for American movies of the time). Simple things like shadows and angles, of course, but also moving camera in subtle ways (the camera falling slightly when approaching someone in a window, for example). Completely first rate.It's common in these movies to have eccentric villains, grotesque monsters, and Gothic settings with wild special effects. And to have the common person as a balance to all this madness. These apply a little comic relief but in a silly way from our perspective. (The \"common\" person at the time in other movies was far more vivid and timeless, like Crawford or Cagney, but that would overwhelm the villains as well as the budget). In this case, one of the common folk is a resourceful doctor, and this search for the bad guy takes on a larger role than in the other monster movies.The movie isn't a sparkling masterpiece. The acting throughout (even by Lugosi, really) isn't always spot on, but it works overall, and is consistent. There is a comic moment near the end (when we are most anxious for action) where the character have an argument in different languages, and it's so perky I'm assuming they felt they couldn't take it out, but it doesn't advance the plot. It does deal with Logosi's characteristic odd accent. And for fun, there is an anachronism, half an hour in, when a bicycle rides through the little town, decades before they were made like that.It won't matter if you don't believe in evolution. The movie plays loose with the concept, and Dr. Mirakle says at one point, with his beady eyes: \"Do you think your little candle can outshine the truth?\"", "Fun, if minor, Universal horror flick which casts Bela Lugosi in his trademark role as a screen icon of pure evil. This is a very loose adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe story; the locked-room murder does occur towards the end of the movie, complete with a body stuffed in a chimney, but this is only part of it. Instead, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE focuses on Lugosi's mad scientist and his Darwinian theories that humans are descended from apes (the setting being Paris in 1845, this idea is widely pooh-poohed). In order to prove this, he attempts to mate a girl with an ape, and his plan involves injecting girls with gorilla blood which results in a series of strange deaths. Lugosi ingeniously dumps the bodies into the river under his house and the victims are simply described as victims of drowning.Of course it's not long before an irritating medical student is on the case to foil Lugosi's plans, but he's interrupted in his task when the ape goes berserk and murders Lugosi itself. This leads to an exciting rooftop finale which acts as a miniature forerunner to KING KONG with the ape kidnapping the young female victim and escaping from roof to roof as her suitor gives chase. A well-placed bullet sends the ape to a watery grave, thus ending the film at the incredibly short hour mark. MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE is an understandably dated film with many aspects to alienate it to modern audiences. Like Dracula, there's no music in any scenes which make it look more like a stage play than a movie. The special effects involve closeups of a cute chimpanzee interspersed with a clumsy man in a poor costume pretending to be an ape and are extremely poor in the modern light.However, all is not lost. As mentioned on the back of the box, the film does recall the classic German Expressionist movies in the use of lighting and shadows, and strange backdrops which really help to give it a unique look. There's a fair amount of brooding atmosphere built up in the backstreets of a dirty Paris and plenty of ghoulish humour in the morgue (as well as some unwanted over-the-top comedy and acting at a police inquest). The film also benefits considerably from one of Lugosi's best roles as a crazed, demented scientist who talks to his pet ape and shocks people at a carnival with his insane evolutionary theories (the irony being, of course, that he was correct in his assumptions). Lugoi's wild-haired mad man gets to wear some great costumes which emphasis his skeletal body and delivers his lines with an evil relish. The same quality cannot be said of the rest of the cast, especially the boring hero and his policemen chums, whom we have no interest in whatsoever. Thankfully Sidney Fox makes for quite a fetching beauty and can scream with the best of them. MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE isn't one of Universal's best movies, but it remains a solid (if dated) piece of entertainment with much to commend it to classic horror fans.", "I won't go into the plot details as many have done that before me, but \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is worth a look for several reasons.The first is the overall look of the film from legendary DP Karl Freund (Dracula, Metropolis, and many others). The sets are outstanding, the lighting is great, and the overall atmosphere is perfect. Everything comes off as some creepy nightmare.The second reason to see \"Murders\" is Bela Lugosi, who owns every scene he is in. He is sufficiently strange and intimidating as the mad doctor.The third reason is the overall story line. OK, forget the whole mixing of the ape and human blood thing and this movie is very similar in plot line to \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", just substitute the ape for Cesare the Somnambulist. It also contains some very strong (for its time) scenes involving the doctor \"administering\" to his patients.OK, now some things that aren't so hot.First, the cutting between the man in the ape suit and the real ape's face is distracting. The shots don't match and some serious suspension of disbelief is required for this not to be a deal breaker. I've heard that Florey's film was cut against his wishes to add these scenes and remove others. That would explain why these scenes seem out of place.Also, as others have referred to, the comic relief is really not very good. At the time, however, this type of thing was common in films that were thought to be very intense. The comedy was used to relieve the tension so the audience could be set up for the next batch of horrors. Most of it doesn't work in this film.Overall, I felt this film was well worth a look, and I've watched it several times just to admire the outstanding work of Karl Freund.", "While at first glance Dr. Mirakle (Bela Lugosi) appears to be like many of the other sideshow charlatans, there's something very sinister about the man. It seems that he has been experimenting with the relationship between human and ape blood to prove their mutual lineage. But his experiments require a healthy human body with which to inject gorilla blood. And Dr. Mirakle will stop at nothing to get \"volunteers\" to assist him with his work.What Works:Bela. I don't care how bad or dull the material, Bela Lugosi always appears to be having the time of his life and is somehow able to transmit that feeling to the viewer. It's difficult to watch one of his performances and not be drawn to the man. His Dr. Mirakle is another in the long line of characters given life by Bela. He is just so devilishly demented that it's impossible not to enjoy the character or the actor playing the character. Good job, Bela.Cinematography. I've made no secret over the years of my fondness for Karl Freund. Many of the movies where he credited for the cinematography (or directed) are among my favorites. His work on Murders in the Rue Morgue does not disappoint. Many of the scenes are shot like works of art. One of my favorites (and not just in this movie, but when compared with other movies) is the scene where Bela's prostitute victim is tied to the cross in his laboratory. The lighting, staging, and use of shadows make it one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen.What Doesn't Work:Stagey. While this is a common complaint with some of the older films, I think I have only used the term twice before - Dracula and The Cocoanuts. But the term \"stagey\" fits many scenes in Murders in the Rue Morgue quite nicely. The unnatural feel caused by this took away from the atmosphere the movie was going for in many of these scenes.The Rest of the Cast. As good as Bela is, many of the other members of the cast have trouble meeting the standard set by Bela. The actor who immediately comes to mind is Leon Ames. On more than one occasion I found myself groaning out loud at his ludicrous performance.That's No Gorilla. This may seem picky, but I was bothered almost the entire movie by the close-ups of the gorilla that obviously wasn't a gorilla. In long shots, it's easy to tell that it's a man in a gorilla suit. But in the tight shots, the gorilla suddenly transforms into a chimpanzee. It's very distracting.If for no other reason than Bela Lugosi's performance and the incredible cinematography of Karl Freund, I will re-watch this movie. While Murders in the Rue Morgue may never become a favorite of mine, the work of these two men easily makes the movie better than average. If you're a fan of either, I'm sure you will agree.", "Having decided not to do the Frankenstein monster, Bela's next film for Universal was this rather stagey thriller about a demented doctor trying to mix the blood of an ape with a virgin.  The story is a bit far-fetched, and Lugosi is as over-the-top as he can get, but for the most part the film is good, solid entertainment.  The film is a bit slow, and its has no music in the background.  Add to this some stoic acting on the part of the cast as a whole(Lugosi excepted of course)and some frequent, flat direction from Florey(say that a few times quickly).  Florey shows flashes of brilliance(many of them coming through the magic of Karl Freund's camerawork) with scenes such as Lugosi's pitch in the carnival tent, Lugosi murdering a street prostitute, and the finale of Paris above ground.  Florey is also remarkably mundane in many scenes too, adding little depth to many of the characters as well as not creating enough suspense where always needed.  Florey does deliver more often than not, however.  This film is a good example of the traditional Universal horror film, as well as vehicle to display the talents of one Bela Lugosi.  Look for Arlene Francis(of What's My Line fame) as a prostitute tied to a cross of woodbeams(possibly one of the best sequences in the film).", "Classic terror movie with a powerful cast that will guarantee entertainment .

Scott , Rebecca De Mornay , Ian McShane , Neil Dickson , Val Kilmer.", "\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" isn't nearly as great as the previous year's horror successes \u0096 namely Frankenstein and Dracula \u0096 but nevertheless another progressive and remotely eerie chiller for Universal studios. Loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's writings, \"Murders\u0085\" does feature an old fashioned movie-monster, but the dominating storyline revolves on a mad scientist desperately wanting to prove his awkward theories; even if that means multiple innocent people have to die. Dr. Mirakle, another supremely glorious role for Bela Lugosi, tours around with a carnival and exhibits his pet gorilla Erik to petrified villagers. The traveling show is actually just a disguise, as Mirakle is a scientist obsessed with proving humanity's kinship with the apes and he abducts young women of the street to run tests with their blood. Several bodies end up in the Parisian river, via the trapdoor in Mirakle's lab, but then Erik the gorilla itself points out the next \"victim\" for the Doctor's experiments. The beautiful young Camille would make a fine gorilla's bride indeed, but her fianc\u00e9e is a medical student and quickly suspects Dr. Mirakle is up to no good. \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" isn't stellar entertainment, but horror fans will definitely appreciate the harshly sexual implications as well as the explicit & brutal sequence involving the young prostitute. The harshness is quite shocking considering the year of release, but the film sadly contains too many overlong tedious parts (the whole picnic scene, for example) and suffers from misfit comical elements (Pierre's roommate, the interrogation of the foreign restaurant owners\u0085). The biggest strongpoint of the film is undeniably Karl Freund's moody & sinister cinematography, which is beautifully reminiscent to the expressionistic style of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Later the same year 1932, Freund himself would make his Hollywood debut as a director, with the genuinely brilliant Boris Karloff classic \"The Mummy\".", "Much creepier than any mad scientist and his monkey movie has a right to be. Much of the credit must go to cinematographer Karl Freund (The Last Laugh, Metropolis) who gives the movie the feel of a German horror film. Charles D. Hall's distorted sets also help make this often resemble a sound remake of \"The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari.\" The script has a very European flavor as well with lines that sometimes sound as if they were translated from another language. The ape is more convincing than all those later films because of quick cutting between an actual ape's snarling face and a man in a suit, the latter shown not enough to destroy the illusion. At one point stop motion is used to show the ape carrying a woman across the top of buildings a year before \"King Kong!\" There are three failings, however. Near the end is a long attempt at humor concerning French bureaucracy that hurts the build-up of tension. The other two failings come from the lab. They lay over one sequence a fog effect with the fog blowing at hurricane strength despite no apparent wind anywhere else in the shot. And at the end is a very obvious matte shot with lots of squiggly lines around the characters.", "\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", an adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe tale, is set in 19th century Paris when a mad scientist named Dr. Mirakle (Bela Lugosi) has an exhibit consisting of a \"human\"-like ape. Dr. Mirakle spouts some pretty radical ideas about evolution that local carnival goers find blasphemous. But the bad doctor is committed to his pursuit: proving the link between man and ape. So periodically he abducts young women so they may be injected with gorilla blood. His latest target is Camille L'Espanaye (pretty Sidney Fox), whose boyfriend Pierre (Leon Ames) is not a real Dudley Do Right type himself. He's not above bribing a morgue keeper (D'Arcy Corrigan) to let him have access to dead bodies in order to study them. Overall, this isn't one of the most notable Universal horrors of the time. The main problem is that for a movie running only about one hour, it goes on a little long(!), with some scenes that do feel padded, and some comedy relief (supplied by Bert Roach, as Paul, Pierre's roommate) that doesn't really add anything to it. The movie is simply too slow, too quiet (it could have used a music score), and too light on horror too much of the time. Still, it has the look of quality, with appropriate Expressionist cinematography by Karl Freund, and some good atmosphere. In the movies' few shocking scenes, it *does* deliver, and is actually strong stuff for the time, with people getting stabbed, stripped naked and jabbed with a needle, and stuffed up a chimney. These moments do add punch to the movie, but what really elevates the rating by a point is the presence of Lugosi, one genre star who could always be counted on to give 100% to any role; here he delights in the depraved nature of his character. The other actors are okay but can't exactly compare. Erik himself is portrayed with a combination of a human performer in a gorilla suit and closeups of chimpanzees. This may take some viewers out of the movie too much. Given the short duration, the climax naturally feels a little rushed. All things considered, this is worth a look for devoted fans of 30s horror, but isn't as potent as some of the other productions of the time. John Huston is credited with additional dialogue. Seven out of 10.", "SPOILERS!!! IN 1845 Paris evil Dr. Mirakle (Bela Lugosi) is trying to mate a male gorilla with a woman--but most women die when injected with gorilla blood. This involves him disposing of a lot of corpses. The gorilla seems very attracted to beautiful Camille (Sidney Fox) and her boyfriend Pierre Dupin (Leon Waycroff) isn't happy...but Mirakle thinks she may be the one perfect for the mating.This is rarely shown probably because of the theme of bestiality and a truly harrowing scene involving Arlene Francis as a \"Lady of the Streets\" in Lugosi's lab. By today's standards it's fairly tame but still surprising what they got by with back then. The movie has beautiful expressionistic photography giving it the feel of a German horror film--check out some of the backdrops--they're straight out of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligri\"! Lugosi is great in his role--hamming it up in an amusing way. Unfortunately most of the movie concentrates on the colorless Fox and Waycroff and their boring romance. And the \"gorilla\" is obviously a guy in a shabby ape suit! They only use him for far shots and intercut shots of a real gorilla for closeups--but it's pretty obvious. Those elements severely lessen what could have been a great horror film. Still it's above average and worth catching.", "This movie is tagged with genres horror, crime, mystery and romance. But in none of these aspects it really shines. I think it's a curiosity at best. The only interesting scenes were towards the end when the gorilla abducted the girl and was trying to escape with her over the rooftops. Maybe that scene gave movie makers eventually the idea to make King Kong as it really reminded me a lot of the legendary film ape. Plot and characters are not at all interesting. The character of Dr Mirakle is nice and fitting for Bela Lugosi even though I do prefer him as count Dracula. It's a plot with potential and they try to do make it mysterious even though as viewer we already know from the beginning the intentions of Dr Mirakle. I found it boring and predictable most of the time. There was even a bit of humor in it with the 3 men arguing about the language the suspect spoke which was amusing but served mostly a filler in my opinion. How interesting if Dr Mirakle really succeeded in his experiment, now that would have been interesting!", "A fascinating if unsatisfying addition to the Universal horror cycle (co-written by John Huston!) with a splendid turn from Bela Lugosi - complete with his inimitable delivery - and some highly interesting sets obviously inspired by THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1919). The leads are among the blandest in 30s horror cinema but Robert Florey's stylized direction and Karl Freund's Expressionistic camera-work make up for this deficiency in spades: the foggy night-time sequences, carnival scenes and the gorilla rampage at the end (which reminded me of the similar finale of Hammer's THE CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF [1961], incidentally!) are quite effective. The film followed the trend of sadistic violence (which reached a peak in Universal's THE BLACK CAT [1934]) and sexual overtones (first touched upon by DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE [1931]) prevalent at the time - which certainly aided its box-office potential - but these elements now seem very tame. In the end, while MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE may not be in the same league as the best Universal horrors, it's still a worthy effort which repays repeated viewings.", "It's a bearable film. It has some nice atmospheric effects due to Karl Freund. The scene of the duel between Arlene Francis' two \"Johns\" or lovers or whatever is stylized to look like two men slowly draining each other of life, until they stab each other to death. But such moments are rare ones. The screenplay is horrible. And that does not mean that it is horrible in the sense that it will benefit a \"horror\" film.Edgar Allen Poe, like most 19th Century writers, constructed his stories to be read - he was good at descriptions, but he was better at mood, particularly by his brilliant ear for words and language. Like in his short story \"THE TELL-TALE HEART\", where he makes the words force the reader into hearing the beat of a hidden heart. His story THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE was the first of a trilogy about an amateur reasoner who aids the police (a prototype for Sherlock Holmes) named C. Auguste Dupin. The tales were Poe's way of showing off his high intellect by inventing his version of Conan Doyle's \"deductive reasoning\" (\"ratiocination\").I won't go into the exact plot, except that it does deal with murders carried out by a non-human agent. It has nothing to do with Pre-Darwinian evolutionary crap, like that supposedly being pursued by Bela Lugosi's \"Dr. Mirakle\" (a name stolen from E.T.A. Hoffman's odd tales, or at least from the Offenbach opera). As such, although it would be really hard to believe such a tragedy could happen in a suburb of a major city, it is a fascinating story. But most of Poe's best stories are just that, fascinating.Aside from Freund's cinematography, Lugosi's acting (it is one of his best roles actually), and some curiosity about the fake gorilla, there is not much going for this film. Leon Waycoff (as pointed out on this thread) later achieved acting success in less heated roles at MGM like in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS and YOLANDA AND THE THIEF. But he was Leon Ames then, and as such he is remembered. Sidney Fox was pushed in the early talkie period, but petered out, and died a forgotten suicide in 1945. Oddly enough, if you are into criminal history, her name has a sinister position. A young man named Sidney Fox murdered his mother in an English hotel in 1930, trying to cover it up as death by misadventure in a fire. For every true crime fan who recalls that Sidney Fox there are not that many film fans who recall the other one.Finally a comment about the director. Robert Florey had a long career in film and movie direction, and is best recalled for being the director of the first Marx Brother comedy (or co-director) THE COCOANUTS. Groucho was dismissive of Florey, because he was French and seemed at sea dealing with the brothers, but their first film is among their best - and dealing with Groucho and his three siblings was quite difficult. Even Leo McCarey had problems with them. In the early sound period, Florey appears to have directed some of the French language movies that came out of Hollywood. Even someone with a language problem could be still useful. Unfortunately, whatever strengths Florey developed as a director are not obvious from this film.", "This is a very early horror flick from Universal. Fresh off their successes with Dracula and FRANKENSTEIN, the studio decided to make a remake of Poe's classic tale of a murderous ape and his evil master (Bela Lugosi).While the original story has been changed a lot in order to make the evil master more like a horror villain, it is still wonderful but very lurid entertainment. For 1932 and even today, the scene where Lugosi is tormenting the street-walker (Arlene Francis) is amazingly scary and horrible to watch. She is tied to a giant wooden X-style cross and she screams VERY realistically as he does his experiments on her. Then, when she dies, the way this is handled is pretty shocking as well! Apart from this very shocking segment, the film is very fast-paced and entertaining. Unlike many of Lugosi's later films, this is a quality picture with good sets, makeup, etc. His acting is also a little more restrained and less hokey than usual. Sure, the guy in the ape costume and the closeups of a gorilla are awfully different, but compared to the horrid effects in THE DEVIL BAT or PLAN 9, this is practically a Merchant-Ivory Production!! And, no matter the film's faults, it is a very good horror film--sure to please fans of the genre.A final note about the male lead, \"Leon Waycoff\". He was later known as \"Leon Ames\" and I can see how this name change probably helped his career. He does a fine job in the film as the bright and heroic young man trying to convince the world's DUMBEST police force that he knows what has occurred. It isn't an exaggeration to say that they made the Keystone Kops look competent!", "In the early 1930s, Universal made three horror films that were loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe stories. Bela Lugosi starred in each of these films and this trilogy ranks as some of the best work of his career. The story for this one follows Poe most closely of the three, although still far removed from the source material. It's about a mad scientist named Dr. Mirakle (a brilliantly over-the-top Lugosi) who seeks to prove evolutionary theory by injecting ape blood into women! He tries it out on several prostitutes but it doesn't work because their blood is \"tainted.\" So he sets his sights on pretty virginal Camille (Sidney Fox) and sends his gorilla Erik to kidnap her. Camille's boyfriend Pierre Dupin (Leon Ames) figures out what Mirakle is up to and rushes to save her from the maniacal doctor and his pet ape.While a very good Universal horror film, it's got some faults that have kept it from being more widely loved. So let's cover them first. Leon Ames (billed as Leon Waycoff here) is an insipid leading man. Ames stated in interviews later in life that he hated the movie and, given his performance, I can see why. He gets a little better in the later scenes but the early romantic stuff is stilted. He also appears at times to be wearing silent movie makeup, which is probably no fault of his. Fat Bert Roach is much worse as the supposed comic relief. I kept hoping Erik would get loose and rip his guts out. He contributes nothing to the movie and thankfully disappears about midway through.The main problem with the movie for many, myself included, is the gorilla itself. A guy in a gorilla suit playing Erik isn't the problem. Given the era this was made there wasn't much else that could be done. However, the cheap close-ups are one of the worst parts of the movie. Whenever they want to show a close-up of Erik, they show footage of some chimpanzee which looks nothing like a gorilla. It's absolutely terrible and takes the movie out of the realm of straight horror film and into camp territory. This is especially bad during the climax of the film when such distractions are definitely not needed.Those problems aside, the movie is still a good one for fans of classic horror films for two reasons: Robert Florey and Bela Lugosi. Florey's Expressionistic direction is excellent. He creates a moody atmosphere with dark foggy streets and Mirakle's creepy shadowy laboratory. He uses several unique camera angles and tricks that you won't find in any other horror films from the period. You'd be more likely to find this type of filmmaking going back a few years to the silent era when German Expressionism was at its height. There are some truly great shots in this movie that classic horror fans will love. Lugosi's Dr. Mirakle, with his wild hair and unibrow, is one of moviedom's most memorable mad scientists. Mirakle's stalking and torturing of a street walker is powerful stuff. It's one of Bela's craziest performances. Hammy? Sure, but thoroughly enjoyable.It's a very good movie that most Universal horror fans and Lugosi fans will enjoy. The other two films in the trilogy are The Black Cat and The Raven, which star Bela alongside Boris Karloff. Those two movies are even better than Rue Morgue, though they have even less to do with Poe!", "I wonder if the Laemmles were trying to tell their new young starlet Sidney Fox something by casting her opposite a man in an ape suit, AND unforgivably giving her top billing over the real (human) star, Bela Lugosi. \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" has long been considered the low point of the Laemmle era, loads of atmosphere but ludicrous situations and dialogue to match (some of which was credited to future director John Huston). The embarrassing Sidney Fox had debuted opposite Bette Davis (and Bert Roach) in \"The Bad Sister\" but is so completely out of her depth here that it's a wonder she lasted two more years. Leon Ames (billed under his real name, Waycoff) debuts in this film (along with future television personality Arlene Francis, who had very few movie credits), but obviously preferred character work over playing romantic leads. Lugosi is truly the whole show, but his character's unhealthy harassment of the tiny Sidney makes him look like a real creep; still, it's the first of his many mad scientists, and his sideshow lecture provides his finest showcase. In viewing this film, I restructured it beginning with the fog-shrouded meeting with the prostitute, followed by her death, then Pierre's first visit to D'Arcy Corrigan's morgue, then the carnival (everything did flow much better that way). Director Robert Florey also completely botches the climax, with three ethnics arguing over which of them is right, and a rooftop chase that creates no tension. Apparently, in creating Ames' character of Pierre Dupin, Edgar Allan Poe virtually invented the fictional detective, about 40 years before Sherlock Holmes, presented as a medical student who conducts his own investigation into the Rue Morgue Murders. In 1942, Universal brought back Dupin (now named 'Paul' rather than 'Pierre'), in the person of actor Patric Knowles, in another Poe adaptation, \"Mystery of Marie Roget.\"", "Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932)** 1/2 (out of 4)Universal shocker about a deranged scientist (Bela Lugosi) who tries to mix gorilla blood into the body of a woman. This was considered strong stuff back in the day and you can still see that after viewing this all these years later. Robert Florey adds a lot of style to the film, which also boasts a lot of atmosphere but the thing still remains quite slugish at times. Even though the film only runs 60-minutes there are several times during the film that it gets long in the tooth so to speak. Lugosi turns in a very good performance as the crazed doctor but the supporting cast are all rather weak. The visual style borrows quite heavily from the German classics of the early 20s.", "It would be difficult to find a more tragic Hollywood figure than winsome, pert, diminutive Sidney Fox. Here she is at the apex of her career, appearing as the number-one star (Bela Lugosi was second-billed) of Universal's fascinating if somewhat unbalanced entry in the thriller cycle, Murders in the Rue Morgue, adapted from the story by Edgar Allan Poe by director Robert Florey, with additional dialogue by John Huston (his third screen credit and we sincerely hope that his contributions are the best of a rather mixed sample). Oddly, Florey's direction is a bit inconsistent. The scenes of menace are handled most effectively, but Florey seems less able directing some of the dialogue scenes particularly all those that revolve around Bert Roach's comedy relief material. The ambitious over-acting by Leon Ames doesn't help either. Nevertheless, some of Florey's directorial touches are nothing short of masterly particularly in the scenes depicting Mirakle soliciting a prostitute, Fox's dizzying ride on a swing, and the rapid cutting in the murder scene. These touches are nothing short of sheer genius.", "First, on discovering that the young medical doctor was being played by LEON AMES (well-known now as the father in MGM's MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS and LITTLE WOMEN), under a different surname (Waycoff). And recognizing the prostitute as none other than ARLENE FRANCIS, who later became a television personality on \"What's My Line?\" and a rather well-known actress on stage and in films.Let's just say that Ames made a much better character actor in his later years than he does here as a romantic lead. And while BELA LUGOSI chews the scenery to bits, he's the best thing about this film which has an old European flavor to it--although it seems that, aside from Lugosi's strong European accent, everyone else in Paris sounds as though they come from California.The scenery is obviously just that--painted and photographed in an impressionistic European manner (odd angles, etc.)--and the photography definitely creates an atmosphere in keeping with the strange Edgar Allen Poe story. But something has to be said about the flowery dialog which had additional help from none other than John Huston. Since it is all pretty horrible, we can't give Huston any credit here. It's the most cringe-worthy dialog you'll ever hear in a film made in 1932, sounding, as someone else suggested, as if the words were literally translated from another language.So it's only Lugosi who puts the right frightful flavor into the story and manages to hold audience interest spellbound as he goes through his paces as Dr. Mirakle. He's photographed by Karl Freund to look extremely sinister and made up in his most eerie mode with wild eyebrows and busy hair and is a truly scary sight when he makes an unannounced visit to SIDNEY FOX's apartment in the middle of the night. Miss Fox, incidentally, while pretty, is a strictly cardboard heroine who knows how to scream. The less said about her performance the better. The ape's performance is questionable too, since all of the long shots are clearly those of a man in ape costume intercut with close-ups of an agitated ape. And the attempts at comedy for a long scene toward the end where witnesses are being questioned, is totally pointless and interrupts the pace of the story.This was all done to much better effect in THE PHANTOM OF THE RUE MORGUE which came out in the '50s and wherein the story was told much more effectively with Karl Malden as the man with the ape, atmospheric despite its Technicolor trappings.Only fans of the old Universal thrillers will be willing to overlook the extensive faults of this one."], "tt0023572": ["Yes, THARK is an exclamation by a person who sees a ghost in this delightfully dippy haunted house comedy...and so you can easily see the risqu\u00e9 joke in the title. Today of course they just bellow F**CK. There were many haunted house comedies of this period generally between versions of the Cat And The Canary and right up to Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein or even Francis in a Haunted House. One of my favorite British scare comedies is The Haunted Lighthouse from about 1934. THARK (say it out loud) borrows also from The Cat Creeps, The Bat Whispers and any other films post 1927 lifted from plays about specters and weird butlers and stormy nights in a mansion, a burglary and perhaps a murder. See also THE PHANTOM OF CRESTWOOD. As far as rude movie titles go, it is a beauty and not bettered until THE AMAZING DR CLITTERHOUSE (clitoris) of the 40s. Hilarious!", "All films deserve a review, so I intend to add one for those I have seen that so far have none. I am stringing this out as there is some minimum size requirement here for reviews, this is obviously a rare film as I write this review Oct-2011 the film has failed to register 5 votes to achieve a rating, mine is 3/7. I saw the film in Nov-2002 at the Gothique film society in London, hopefully that is sufficient 'filling' review follows, minor spoiler...A Whitehall farce transferred to the screen, set in a supposedly haunted house which it isn't- slow to start & introduce rather too many characters, but still able to raise a few laughs in the second half when everyone is in the house."], "tt0023582": ["This campy little coo-coo bird has to be seen to be believed. Beware of anonymously sent bouncy balls. I first saw this film many years ago on the early American Movie Classics (before it was destroyed by commercials and awful movies); I made of point of watching it because I was reading Myrna Loy's autobiography at the time and she mentioned this film.Modern viewers may be a bit surprised to find that there is really nothing new in film-making; everything in the psychological thrillers and slasher films over the years that terrified you is done here, and better. Like the rest of the reviewers, I am nearly insane with wonder at what the famous missing 15 minutes might hold (I know a scene further developing the Peg Entwistle character was deleted), but the existing version of this film is a tight, entertaining hour of suspense.Exotic and beautiful Ursula Georgi sets out across America to reek her revenge on those upper crust white gals that ousted her from her school sorority and ruined her chance in life to \"pass\" as one of the elite. If you can actually locate the book this is based on, it's a very enlightening read, for therein we learn that poor Ursula was whored out as a young girl. An orphanage finally placed in her in the sorority with the rich white girls to save her from her life of degradation and exploitation. I believe Ms. Loy must have read the novel, she plays Ursula with a clear awareness of the horrors of her young past. By ostracizing and then kicking her out of the sorority, the rich snobs destroyed her chance to escape and live among the rich and respectable. No wonder she is murderously furious with them. A round robin letter, horoscopes of dread, the stink-eye from Ursula and former sorority sisters end up in the obituary column one by one.Even today, this hour long film is tensely paced and engaging. Ricardo Cortez is always a pleasure to watch, a smooth, beautiful man and a superb actor who brings a touch of class to all of his work. Young Myrna Loy is beginning to show the prowess that would make her one of the most successful of all 20th century actors. If you love 1930's films, this is a very unique and interesting one, you won't be sorry.", "Watching Thirteen Women I wonder what Merle Oberon must have thought. She lived in real life what Myrna Loy's character was experiencing in the film. It was only after she died that it came out that Merle was of mixed racial origin. She successfully passed her entire life.Loy who was in fact Caucasian until she became the incarnation of the perfect wife and mother played a whole lot of these exotic characters. She borrows a bit from her performance as Fu Manchu's daughter in playing a woman who is exacting terrible revenge on members of a sorority at a finishing school who discovered her background and used it to get her expelled. It was her ticket into the white world and respectability as she saw it.Using C. Henry Gordon as a phony swami she has unpleasant horoscopes made against her thirteen enemies. Loy doesn't want to just kill them, she wants to torment them and uses Gordon as her means. Loy wants maximum satisfaction.In the case of Irene Dunne who she sees as her chief enemy Loy also has plans for Dunne's child as well.A whole lot of women dominate this film as the sisters like Kay Johnson, Jill Esmond, Florence Eldridge and more. Ricardo Cortez plays the police sergeant who tracks down Loy and Edward Pawley plays another of the men she uses in her fiendish schemes.As this was a before the Code film, there was some frank talk about racism under the guise of snobbery. No doubt that Dunne and the rest were guilty of it. It drove Loy off the deep end and she enacts a terrible vengeance.A really good before the Code film that should be better known.", "What struck me first about THIRTEEN WOMEN (just shown on TCM this evening), is the fact that it has a musical score by Max Steiner at a time when early thirties movies seldom used much music on the soundtrack for atmospheric purposes. But here, at least, Max does let loose with some sinuous exotic strains for a few scenes.The second thing was how beautiful MYRNA LOY photographed, playing a half-caste who is determined to avenge what snobbish sorority sisters did to her in finishing school where she was exiled because she wasn't white. Loy at this stage was still playing these exotic roles, complete with slanting eye make-up--but as a woman with an hypnotic gaze she was quite convincing. C. HENRY GORDON as Yogadachi, the fake Swami, was rather hammy here--whereas five years later he was very effective as a turban-wearing Indian in CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.***POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD***IRENE DUNNE is the last of the sorority girls to survive and the last one to be punished by Loy. However, as suspense builds to a climax aboard a speeding train, Loy's plan fails with the police hot on her trail.The 59 minute running time means that some fifteen minutes were cut from the original release and it shows. The ending is much too abrupt and before you know it \"The End\" is flashed on the screen. Someone was busy with the scissors on this one, particularly during those final moments.Would love to see the complete film some day, but I suppose that's not going to happen if the footage hasn't been restored by now. All the performances are rather standard, including RICARDO CORTEZ as the detective who's able to solve the case. FLORENCE ELDRIDGE is almost unrecognizable as one of the women and KAY JOHNSON is a bit over the top as one of the victims who shoots herself.Summing up: Not bad and certainly worth a watch.", "I looked forward to seeing this film on TCM. I was disappointed in what I saw. I've read that several minutes were cut from the original for censorship and other reasons and have never been restored. Even Turner who usually attempts to present features uncut and in as pristine condition as is humanly possible hasn't done much with this early talkie, even the sound was bad. So I have to go with what I saw. First, being an early talkie, many of the actors were still gesticulating and shouting their lines as if on stage or doing a silent flick. Particularly guilty of this was C. Henry Gordon who played a key character Swami Yogadachi. Fortunately for the viewer he is killed not long after the movie begins. The two future divas, Irene Dunne and Myrna Loy, do much better and appear very modern with their acting skills. Ursula Georgi (Myrna Loy) is sinister and evil to the core yet smiles like an adorable angel. Irene Dunne as Laura Stanhope plays the type role that she would perfect in later movies. Ricardo Cortez as Police Sergeant Barry Clive does a decent job in a role that isn't all that demanding.Second, the writing is good with an intriguing plot: twelve former classmates of a boarding school are being killed off by rejected classmate number thirteen through the use of phony horoscopes. The plot should have enabled the story to move along at an even pace. Yet there are places in this approximately one hour film that are very boring. These boring stretches are broken by a few exciting moments. The trapeze scene is a dandy as is the final scene aboard the fast-moving train. Cinematography is exceptional in some places considering the age of the film, especially the final scene featuring Myrna Loy. Also impressive is the car chase sequence when the chauffeur is attempting to make a getaway with Laura Stanhope captive in the back seat.Third, though the racial prejudice angle is bold and enlightening for 1932 when Hollywood was notorious for racial stereotyping, it actually only figures in at the very end of the movie in one extremely well-done and well-written scene when the two protagonists Ursula and Laura (Loy and Dunne) confront one another in a spell-binding moment of truth and retribution.How long must we wait until a restored version of this film is released on DVD so we can make a more accurate assessment?", "This is an oldie but a goodie, albeit a short one - one of the other comments explains what happened, but no one knows the reason.Myrna Loy is very beautiful and exotic as Ursula Georgi (which I actually think is an Italian name) who is a half-caste seeking revenge on sorority sisters who kept her out of their group. She uses the power of suggestion, switching their actual horoscopes by mail that they receive from a swami with predictions of doom. One by one, the women die. She ultimately knocks off the swami and turns her sights on the disbeliever of the group, played by Irene Dunne.Loy would soon break free from exotica with \"The Thin Man\" series. Mrs. Laurence Olivier at the time, Jill Esmond, appears in the film, as do Ricardo Cortez and Peg Entwhistle. For Entwhistle, the dire predictions in the film played out in real life for her. Shortly after this movie was made, she achieved a lasting fame by committing suicide by jumping from the \"Hollywoodland\" sign in Los Angeles.", "This fascinating, hypnotic RKO 'A' film bombed so badly that the studio withdrew it from release, chopped out 15 minutes (from 74 to 59), and disposed of it on the bottom end of double bills.  The question is: Why?Even after 70 years, \"Thirteen Women\" is an eerie, lushly produced thriller that provides more genuine chills than in any of today's counterparts. For movie buffs, the real treat is seeing Irene Dunne and Myrna Loy (both of whom within a year or two would emerge as two of Hollywood's most bankable and respected leading ladies) slumming in a nasty pre-Code creeper about a half-caste sorority girl (Loy) who enlists the aid of a sinister spiritualist to exact revenge on the prejudiced campus \"ladies\" who expelled her from their club a few years earlier.  One by one, and by devious means, Loy (still playing slant-eyed fiends, but not for much longer, thank God!)meticulously plots and carries out the not-for-the-squeamish deaths of her victims--until the last one alive, Irene Dunne, happily married with an adorable young son, remains her sole surviving target.  After her plans to poison the toddler go awry, Loy goes bonkers and boards the train where the police (it certainly takes them long enough to figure out what's going on) have secreted Dunne until they apprehend Loy.  The climax--with a dagger-wielding Loy chasing the terrorized Dunne through one car to the next--is a corker--meticulously copied and working equally well a half a century later in the climax of \"Terror Train\" (with Jamie Lee Curtis duking it out with a transvestite psycho). Even chopped to 59 minutes, \"Thirteen Women\" is still a landmark horror film.  The most baffling mystery is why audiences rejected it in 1932. Perhaps it was ahead of its time.  Depression-era loved mysteries--but uncensored exercises in sheer terror like \"Thirteen Women\" were too scary for comfort (even today, it provokes an unsettling series of shocks that make it the \"Psycho\" of the '30s--and even the \"Psycho\" of 30 years later had to overcome initial critical pans before audiences pounced on it and lapped up every sick, terrifying minute.) Hopefully, the 15 minutes a worried RKO cut from the original prints of \"Thirteen Women\" will be discovered and restored so we may someday see this unexpected treasure as it was intended to be seen. Meanwhile, even the expurgated version (shown occasionally on Turner Classic Movies--check the listings) is as dazzling and brazen a shocker Hollywood turned out in the early 1930s--before the Hayes Office took over and thwarted any further movie from going as gleefully and sadistically over-the-top as the delicious \"Thirteen Women.\"  (Even MGM had to severely edit \"Freaks\" to placate horrified censors and audiences.)", "Spiritualism was a craze at the time this was made and hypnosis not really understood by the public at large something of which the scriptwriters took advantage. They concocted this wildly dated, at times preposterous and overwrought meller that if nothing else spotlights a couple of soon to be top stars.This silly junk was one of Myrna's final Eurasian villainess roles. It's interesting after years of exposure to her as the perfect wife or the level headed, spunky All-American woman to see her in a role that was typical of her pre-stardom days, that of the foreign mantrap. She looks great but is far better than the part deserves. She is noticeably understated while most of the other performers over emote.Made when sound was in its relative infancy many of the performers are still reliant on over-sized, distracting stage gestures. Irene Dunne starts the picture in subdued fashion but ends up as over the top as everyone else, she's been much better elsewhere. Same goes for Florence Eldridge, a very fine actress usually though she's overblown in this.Full of actresses of note for one reason or another. Besides Myrna and Irene there is Jill Esmond, first wife of Laurence Olivier, Kay Johnson, a DeMille favorite and the mother of respected character actor James Cromwell and Peg Entwistle, the infamous and tragic actress who threw herself from the Hollywood sign in despair a few days after this film premiered, it's her only film credit. Except for the two leading ladies each only get a scene or two to make an impression.Fun in a ludicrous way but aside from the cast this is a routine, if outlandish, programmer that were it not for them would be utter forgotten.", "Swami Yogadachi seems to have a knack for predicting the future. When he tells Ursula Georgi what hers will be like, she reminds him that he, too, will die a horrible death. Yogadachi, who has been the favorite of some of the well-to-do women who were together in college, rules over their lives, except with the grounded Laura Stanhope. Laura, who has witnessed some of her former class mates die in mysterious circumstances, is not immune to a threat that comes her way and involves her young son.\"Thirteen Women\", directed by George Archainbaud, is a hybrid film that showcased some actresses that were making their mark in Hollywood. Of course, this film would not have a chance to be made today because even with a couple of stars, it would be prohibitive. The film is a curiosity because it's seldom played. As Neil Doyle pointed out in this forum, \"Thirteen Women\" boasts a music score by the great Max Steiner, at a time when music didn't play an integral part of most pictures of the period.Irene Dunne makes a rare appearance in this film of mystery and esoterica. She usually was seen in comedies that catered to her talent for that type of feature. Myrna Loy appears as yet another one of her evil Asian women, a person of mixed blood who was ostracized by the snobs in college, and now wants her revenge. Ricardo Cortez plays the police detective investigating the different crimes involving the sorority sisters. Jill Esmond, Kay Johnson, Mary Duncan, Florence Eldridge, and C. Henry Gordon, who plays the Swami, do a good job.", "Thirteen white women who all went to school together are marked for death by a half-caste woman that they were cruel to as kids. Irene Dunne plays the lead, an early precursor to the Final Girl from slasher movies made decades later. Myrna Loy as the killer is the principal reason to watch. She was cast as Asian or half-Asian a lot in early films. Here, whatever they've done to her makeup-wise works because she's stunning. Ricardo Cortez plays the detective investigating the case. It's nice to see an actual police detective be smart and not bumbling or corrupt. Notable as the only film of Peg Entwistle, a young actress who infamously committed suicide by jumping off of the Hollywood sign. One of the earliest movies with a female ensemble. The racial subject matter is also pretty frank for the time. I mentioned slasher films before. Well, structurally this one is very similar so, in a sense, it's one of the earliest examples of what would become that subgenre. It's a very interesting movie with some good performances, clever direction, and bonus historical value.", "In the early thirties Tiffany Thayer had written two books which depicted the plight of the half caste - \"Call Her Savage\" - a super film with Clara Bow as Nasa, a fiery \"half breed, in a very sympathetic characterization, and \"Thirteen Women\" - a not so sympathetic treatment. At one point in the film Sergeant Barry Clive (Ricardo Cortez) says \"she's one of those half-castes - half Indian or half Chinese\". In fact nowadays Ursula Georgi (Myrna Loy) would have garnered a lot of sympathy. As a young street urchin being sent to an exclusive girl's school, the constant taunts and bullying from a particular sorority group forced her to leave and not be able to take her place in the \"white\" world. Myrna Loy is mesmerizingly beautiful as Ursula. With David O. Selznick as executive producer and a beautiful haunting score by Max Steiner, this movie was obviously designed as a class A production, so what went wrong to have it drastically cut by 10 minutes?June Rasko (Mary Duncan) and her sister (Harriet Hagman) are the first to meet grim fates, linked to a horrific horoscope chart that has been sent to 12 women, predicting death and destruction in their lives. The horoscopes were sent by Swarmi Yogodachi (C. Henry Gordon) and his original readings saw only happiness, but he is only a puppet and is under the spell of Ursula Georgi, who is exacting insane revenge for the treatment she received at school. When another classmate, Hazel Cousins (Peg Entwhistle) kills her husband and cries \"I must have been out of my mind\" - Laura (Irene Dunne) summons the rest of her school friends to a weekend retreat to show a united front and laugh it off.Helen Dawson (Kay Johnson), unfortunately, doesn't make it. She meets Ursula on the train and her hypnotic presence causes Helen to take her own life. I think Kay Johnson gives a very restrained performance in the small time allotted - I don't think she overacts. Her character is the only one who shows Ursula sympathy. When she bumps into her she recalls \"You wouldn't have very many happy memories as we didn't treat you very well\". When Sergeant Clive calls on Laura to explain what happened to Helen, Laura also confesses she has had a letter predicting her little boy, Bobby, will die before his next birthday. The rest of the movie is concerned with keeping Bobby away from some mysterious poisonous chocolates and a bouncy ball that will explode on impact. Wally Albright is just adorable - a real little boy and not a \"child star\".Ursula has dispensed with Yogodachi, sending his hypnotised body under a train and she has now taken up with Laura's chauffeur, Burns (Edward Pawley) - These old movies teach you never to trust a chauffeur!!! One event Yogodachi had predicted and that was Ursula's terrible death on board a speeding train.To see this film complete would be marvellous. Julie Hayden was one of the women whose scenes were deleted. She was a beautiful actress in the Ann Harding mold (she even played her daughter in \"The Conquerors\"). The films that I have managed to see her in, I found her to be a very sensitive actress but Hollywood didn't treat her well. John Springer talked glowingly of her role in \"Thirteen Women\" in 1974 so it must have been complete at one stage. Fortunately people like Noel Coward and George Jean Nathan did see a special something in her and she had a Broadway career.Highly Recommended.", "I've got to admit that this film is far from a great work of art--with a ridiculous plot and some of the sillier story elements I've seen in some time. Because of this, you really need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the film--exactly what you'd have to do with a monster film or fantasy movie. If you CAN'T do this or you are looking for Shakespeare or something with \"the Lubitsch touch\", you'll probably hate the film. Read on and decide if the film is for you.The film stars Myrna Loy in a completely ridiculous role of playing a woman who is incredibly evil and possessing super-human hypnotic powers. To make it worse, she is supposed to be half-Indian (from the country of India)! This sort of bizarre casting happened several times in Myrna's career before she took on the Nora Charles role from THE THIN MAN--Hollywood producers just didn't know what to do with her. Another great example was her co-starring in THE MASK OF FU MANCHU as a Chinese woman!!! You MUST get past all this to enjoy the film, I know! In addition to Ms. Loy, the film also stars Irene Dunn and Ricardo Cortez. Both did a fine job--in particular Cortez. His role as a police detective was exceptionally well-written, as unlike MOST movie cops of the era, he was smart and didn't make the usual stupid mistakes! He was quite believable and capable in the role.The plot is all about 13 ladies who all went to the same boarding school many years earlier. Apparently, Ms. Loy didn't feel very welcomed at the school and decided to use LOTS of evil dirty tricks to exact her revenge--such as trying to murder their children, pushing them to suicide or actually killing them outright!! She is a truly diabolical and awful (but very fun to watch) nemesis! Additionally, the film breezed along well and featured some excellent and appropriate stunt work. The entire package results in a fun \"guilty pleasure\"--a fun film for a Saturday afternoon like THE COBRA WOMAN or an Errol Flynn adventure film.", "Executive producer: David O. Selznick. Copyright 1 October 1932 by RKO-Radio Pictures, Inc. New York opening at the Roxy: 14 October 1932. U.K. release: 1 April 1933. 8 reels. 74 minutes.NOTES: Only film of Broadway actress and Hollywood starlet Peg Entwistle who committed suicide by jumping from the top of the famous Hollywood sign soon after the picture was completed.COMMENT: Myrna Loy gives a stand-out performance in this thriller. She's a vicious murderess who will stop at nothing to revenge herself on the twelve members of a racist sorority who made her school days hell. Loy is so impressive that she easily out-shines every other member of the cast, including highly-touted Irene Dunne, fresh from her 1930/31 Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her performance in Cimarron. Loy also has the advantage of superior make-up, costuming and lighting, whereas Miss Dunne often looks positively dowdy.Of the other eleven women, the most interesting are Mary Duncan, Harriet Hagman and Peg Entwistle. This trio is seen right at the very beginning, with the lovely Mary Duncan, the slinky temptress of silents, as the trapeze artist who receives a rather frightening horoscope. She confides in her friend, Peg Entwistle (an excellent performance this), that she fears she will cause the death of her sister \u2014 the wonderfully personable and beautiful Harriet Hagman.The hero, Ricardo Cortez, makes a rather late entrance and then has not a great deal to do, despite his top billing. Nonetheless, he does give an ingratiating performance. Ed Pawley is likewise impressive as Loy's lover/accomplice. But, next to Loy's, the most memorable acting in the movie comes from C. Henry Gordon. No-one who sees this picture will ever forget the subway scene with Loy and Gordon, masterfully edited by Buddy Kimball.", "With a trapeze mishap, the \"Marvel Circus\" begins a series of horrifying accidental deaths, which seem to be hypnotically predicted by an exotic \"Swami\" from the Far East. As the bodies pile up, a connection becomes clear; they are among the \"Thirteen Women\" who attended a boarding school with sexy mystic Myrna Loy (as Ursula Georgi). It quickly becomes evident that Ms. Loy is seeking revenge against twelve schoolgirls. They were cruel to, and exposed Loy, who was trying to pass as white. \"Do you know what it means to be a half-breed, a half-caste in world rule by whites?\" Loy asks. Sensible Irene Dunne (as Laura Stanhope) tries to reassure the still friendly women, but they are understandably wary. Handsome detective Ricardo Cortez (as Barry Clive) investigates the deaths, which threaten to include Ms. Dunne's cute son. There are a few good moments, but they don't add up.***** Thirteen Women (9/16/32) George Archainbaud ~ Myrna Loy, Irene Dunne, Ricardo Cortez, Jill Esmond", "This is a very unusual film, not least because Myrna Loy, best known for cheerier films, here plays an extremely sinister character. What is more surprising is that she is extremely convincing in that kind of role. There must have been another side to Myrna! Even more unusual, she plays an Anglo-Indian woman. For those who don't know, that means people who were born in India during the Raj who were half English and half Indian. The Anglo-Indians experienced a great deal of prejudice in India because they were not accepted by the Indians, being 'half-breeds', and were also looked upon as inferior by the English. Here, Myrna has a huge chip on her shoulder and is obsessed with resentment at having been treated in a humiliating manner at her boarding school by the other girls. She is, not to put too fine a point on it, dangerously mad. She is determined to get even despite the fact that it is so many years later. She tracks down the other twelve 'girls', now obviously women, and starts killing them one by one. I first came across this film under the title TREIZE FEMMES ('thirteen women'), and wrongly dated 1936, as a DVD release in the RKO Series by Editions Montparnasse in Paris. On its rear cover is the boast, in the form of a quote from Serge Bromberg: 'A rarity never distributed in France' (in French of course.). Well, things have changed, it is now widely available, as more and more forgotten old movies get released. Another reason for the French to get excited was that the film was directed by the French-born director George Archainbaud, who emigrated to America when he was 25 and became a director of 146 films, including the TV series THE LONE RANGER (1949-50), HOPALONG CASSIDY (1952-54), ANNIE OAKLEY (1954-57), and a host of other such Americana. He was therefore very drastically 'un-Frenched' in his new environment, something that the French find incomprehensible, fascinating, and also alarming. The film includes a somewhat subdued performance by Irene Dunne, who four years later would become an eternal icon for her starring role in SHOW BOAT (1936). Both Irene Dunne and Myrna Loy doubled up and played two of the other twelve girls who were minor characters, though this was not revealed in the credits. Another interesting feature of this film is that Myrna uses hypnotic powers to wreak her vengeance. Spell-binding stuff!", "This wonderful thriller stars Irene Dunne and Myrna Loy before they were superstars. It is based on the book by Irene Thayer. Myrna Loy wasn't treated was rejected by a college sorority group, and now she plans revenge on them.This motion picture also has Peg Entwhistle as Hazel Cousins. This tragic beauty committed suicide not long after the picture was released, but she killed herself in a rather strange way. She jumped off of the letter H in the HOLLYWOOD sign.", "Odd and mysterious film revolving around a woman described as a \"Hindu half-breed\" (played by Myrna Loy) who writes fake horoscope predictions under the guise of a famous Swami and mails them to a circle of former female classmates to get even with them. Death and suicide is the norm for these \"predictions\", which somehow start to come true just based on the power of suggestion. One woman receives a horoscope predicting the death of someone close to her - then, oh dear, the power of persuasion is in full force when she and her sister perform their \"world famous double flip done without a net\" flying trapeze circus stunt and the sister falls to her death. Luckily a bright cop is soon on the job to solve the mystery and put an end to these \"horoscope murders\".This film is short, fast-paced, mysterious, and quite good, actually. Myrna Loy is fine in her performance, using her hypnotic eyes in close-up to seduce unwilling partners - and victims, though the very heavy eye makeup on her here isn't exactly grounds for making her believable as half Asian. Irene Dunne is excellent in this too, as the classmate who tries to persuade the others to use reason and not believe these silly horoscopes, then has Loy on her back trying to \"break\" her - by sending poisoned candy and a ball with a bomb to try and kill Dunne's little boy. Yeah, you got it - a real evil piece of work, that woman. Quite a good film, well worth seeing.", "It's a true over the top melodrama and it's not really surprising that it didn't do well at the box office. The most amazing thing is that you don't get the full impact of the plot until the very end when Myrna Loy as the strangely exotic Ursula Georgi explains to the ivory white Irene Dunne how she had wanted so badly to pass as white at the finishing school they attended, and that the reason she took her revenge was because they had rejected her as a half-caste.\"Do you know what it means to be a half-breed, a half-caste, in a world ruled by whites?\" Myrna Loy hisses. \"I spent six years slaving to make enough money to put me through finishing school, to make the world accept me as white. But you, and the others, wouldn't let me cross the color line.\"\"But we were young,\" whimpers Irene Dunne. \"Maybe we were cruel. But you can't use that to justify murder!\"\"I can,\" says Myrna calmly as she slowly moves closer towards Irene to hypnotize her (this bit also looks a LOT like the lesbian seduction scene in Dracula's Daughter).This was one of many, many such roles for Myrna Loy who played everything from Latina to Chinese in her early Hollywood career.", "Campy and entertaining, there are flashes of brilliance here: tight shots on Loy, made up as an evil Indian mystic bent on getting revenge against her old classmates, some scenes where tension is built up rather nicely (I won't spoil them), and even a car chase scene, 1932-style. You'll have to suspend disbelief over the concept that the mind can be controlled by another via 'waves', but that's part of the fun. Loy's motivation is revealed towards the end as she confronts Irene Dunne, and it reveals the racial climate of the times: as a \"half-caste Indian half-breed\", she was not allowed to \"pass\" as white in a sorority. As she explains it, for half-breed men this meant being a coolie, and for a woman, she simply shrugs, implying prostitution. As with many films treating race relations at the time, it has a mixed message, on the one hand, pointing out the unfairness of the sorority (and how racist its rules were), and on the other, elevating fears of violence by non- Caucasians. It's interesting that the film has quite a bit of the framework of the modern thriller in it, but it's not fleshed out as much as it ideally would have been, and seems abrupt in places. Finding out that the original release was 14 minutes longer could explain that, but I have to review it for what survives. You could do worse, and it's actually kind of a fun movie. Oh, and last point \u2013 interesting to see Peg Entwistle in her only credited screen role, before jumping from the 'H' in the Hollywood(land) sign in despair. Watch for her character 'Hazel' early on.", "Somewhere written in the stars, made me, want to see this movie. Call it the power of suggestion, but I found this beautiful female ensemble film, pretty interesting. Directed by George Archainbaud, this psychological hypnosis thriller was based on the 1930 bestselling novel by Tiffany Thayer, of the same name. The story tells the story of 13th women, who were once into the occult. During their time as sorority sisters, they mistreated, and condescension, another woman, Ursula Georgi (Myrna Loy), because of her mixed-race heritage. 15 years later, all the girls, receives a horoscope letter from fame, swami, Yogadachi (C. Henry Gordon), foreseeing their end, because of that one crude act. Soon enough, the women started to be die in mysterious tragic ways. Fearing for her life, one of the 13th women, Laura Stanhope (Irene Dunne) to eager to find a way to stop the terrific curse, by confronting the dark figure from the past, in a last ditch attempt to save herself and her family. Without spoiling the movie too much, the movie is very entertaining, despite it, being really dated. While, the special effects are bit rough like the flowing head. It's still works. The action scenes like the slow car chase might seem bit silly, today. It's still intense, watching it. The acting is alright for the most part, but there are way too much characters to keep track of. All of the women, look way too much like each other. The ones that stand out, were a joy. Loy and Dunne were superb. In a rather creepy parallel event, one of the supporting actress, Penny Entwistle, commit suicide, a few weeks, before the movie release by jumping from the Hollywoodland Sign, due to her screen time here being cut-down and her career dying down. Many believe, this movie is haunted, because of that. While the movie might seem like very one-dimension, it's not. Made, before the Hays Code, the movie tackle a lot of deep social issues, such as religionist practices, social classes, women rights, miscegenation, and others. In many ways, Thirteen Women was one of the first exploitation films that feature many lurid subject matters. One of the biggest issues that the movie often, get criticize for, is the way, it seem to present the film's concept of race. While the movie might be look upon, as racist, outdated, xenophobia propaganda, to a lot of modern audiences. The movie does have some moments that taught people, to be a little more racial tolerance and respect, toward people of another race or a mixed-race, in some degree. This little message, would often be, overlook, due to the highly offensive and often preachy, racial purification message that this movie was presenting. The movie haves this idea that mixed breeding is wrong and by doing it, would lead to demon-like supernatural spawns that will seek revenge on the purists. I really found this part of the film to be a bit misleading since genetic diversity has been going on, since the beginning of time. After all, most Caucasian are already mixed-breed on their own, way before this movie came out. The movie would later, contradict this, by pushing making a statement, about race and the social stratification, through the eyes of Ursula Georgi. While, Ursula is play as the villain, in the film, in many ways, the writers made her, seem more like the victim in a way. The movie gave her, a lot more depth and heart that a normal 1930s villain might get. I can relate to her. She was indeed a complex character who often told the truth, more than lie. It's true, that fair-skinned people, in the 1930s had more social freedoms, than minorities. The only problem with this plot, is that Ursula Georgi looks white and could be easily mistaken for one. It's really hard to believe, that Ursula wouldn't be able to gain the same social opportunities as the other women, due to her race. I really find it, funny that Myrna Loy's character is supposed to Javanese mixed with Indian, but she shows, none of the characteristic of being, from that area. It's somewhat also outrageous, how little, the writers know Indian culture. They portray the often peaceful Hinduism religion as an evil devil-worshipping occult to the point that it felt like it was self-referential, something else. I know that, many modern audience today probably couldn't look deeper into the film, due to how offensive, the film is, but I found the movie to be, a little more gripping in its storytelling. I see the film, as a foreshadowing metaphor for the rise of Nazism. There are lots of examples in this film that point to this theory. It's very plausible. Still, I really don't know, if the movie was trying to be anti-racist, or racist. That movie message came across as very clumsy and very un-coherence as the movie seem to no clue, what it was presenting. It change a lot of things from the source material. In no-way, can be compare to better than the book. The movie also falls short of being an uncommonly deep, due to it, feeling a bit incomplete. This might be because, 14 minutes were removed before the movie's release due to censorship disrupts. Due to this, the movie has a lot of awkward cut-scenes with star-shape fade outs. While the movie is call; 13th women; in truth, the film only portrays eleven ladies, due to these awful editing cut scenes. The movie ends in a mere 59 minutes, which is way too short. Sadly, the delete scenes were never put back in, as those scenes were presumably lost even today. The Warner Archive Collection's DVD-R of this movie tries to have a good version, but while it's transfer of this is great. Some reels still have light scratches and scattered dust. Still, overall: this movie is a highly eccentric, vintage RKO thriller, worth the watch. I do recommended", "This was actually a really good movie. So good, it would stand up against todays horror movies as well as easily translate into a remake (rather surprised it hasn't already). A further poignancy is lent to Ursula's confession of her motives--even though \"crossing the color line\" isn't exactly PC, her speech sums up the history of this country and its treatment of anyone who does not and cannot conform to \"whiteness.\" The movie does resort to \"yellow face\" (Myrna Loy and the man who plays the Swami), as well as conforming to \"Oriental\" and \"Shady Orient\" stereotypes, but the heart of the story is surprising in its realism, and for such a short movie (just an hour), it packs a good amount of thrill.", "No need to repeat points made by others. One unmentioned ingredient the movie sorely lacks is mood, which is usually established by visual style. In short, the movie has no visual style to complement the eerie proceedings. Instead, director Archainbaud films in unimaginative, straightforward fashion, using high-key lighting even in those spooky situations crying out for shadow. That's not surprising since the bulk of the director's career was spent helming undemanding Gene Autry half-hours for early TV. No wonder the pass-off stunt between the two cars in this film is so expertly handled. Archainbaud was an action director and clearly the wrong man to develop a Gothic exercise like Thirteen Women. Think what a great visual stylist like Edgar Ulmer (The Black Cat) or Tod Browning (Dracula; Freaks) could have done with the same dark material. For example, note the weird looking interior constructed for Ursula's two- story abode. It's a real eye-catcher but goes unaccented by Archainbaud's pedestrian style. Think what Ulmer, in particular, would have done with that bizarre set-up. Then too, maybe a more attuned director or producer could have prevented the studio from butchering the contents with its notoriously clumsy deletions and departures. Nonetheless, mood or no mood, cat-eyed Ursula (Loy) can cast a spell on me any day of the week and the proverbial twice on Sunday, that is, if I can manage it.", "Myrna Loy in one of her earliest--and perhaps silliest--roles, that of a half-caste named Ursula Georgi who strikes back at the women who ostracized her years before at a girls' school in San Francisco using \"the power of suggestion.\" Loy, ever the outcast, looks made-up for a night with Fu Manchu; with her colorful appearance and eyes glinting with delicious revenge and evil satisfaction, one may assume Myrna was getting a kick out of these overwrought proceedings. Although the film was produced by RKO and probably had a fairly large budget for 1932, it seems tatty and awkward, and saddled with an anticlimactic finish. It may be just enough of a curio to garner a desperate audience, however anyone looking for a prime example of the Golden Age of Hollywood would be well-advised to duck and cover. ** from ****", "Thirteen Women (1932)** (out of 4)Pretty weak thriller has Myrna Loy playing a psychotic half-American, half-Chinese woman who uses hypnosis to kill thirteen of her former classmates who wouldn't let her join their sorority due to her race. There are some interesting elements here but in the end this film comes off very weak, rushed and just not all that interesting. The biggest problem is that the film was cut by several minutes and then reshot after a poor test screening. Only eleven women are featured in the film because two of them were cut so that Irene Dunne could have extra scenes added. These added scenes are the weakest in the film as they involve the attempted murder of her young child. Dunne is pretty stiff in her role but Loy comes off very good as the vamp but sadly she isn't in the film enough. Her final speech about being hated because of her race is very well done. Peg Entwistle plays one of the girls and is today best remembered for climbing up the Hollywood sign and killing herself by jumping off. That event took place two days after this film was released. Ricardo Cortez plays the lead detective and seems to be sleepwalking.", "I great film! I liked it because it's got lots of action - suicide, murder, accidents...speeding trains and car chases. LOVED IT! Myrna Loy is styled up into another world...pure Hollywood glamor with a dose of Orientalism. Too divine. The good news is that's not too long....for those of you looking for a high quality flick...me? I'm happy with the costumes and sets. I like to show this one as half of a double feature. I saw this one Turner Classics and I thought the sound and quality of the print were great. The police officer sends a \"telephoto\" of the suspect. I didn't know they had that technology in 1931. Seemed like a FAX to me. What a stunner that Loy is...and from Montana yet! Billy", "There may have originally been 13 women targeted for revenge but the cutting of the film obviously lessened that number considerably. Nevertheless, this story of one woman's mission to do away with the girls who snubbed her for sorority membership is worth watching.Myrna Loy, again playing the role of an Eurasian, is beautiful and mysterious as the revenge seeker. Due to her unusual beauty, she made her early career playing exotics and the low-key lighting of this film served her well in some of her scenes. Included in the cast are the then Mrs. Laurence Olivier (Jill Esmond), Irene Dunne and Peg Entwhistle (whose tragic real-life leap from the Hollywoodland sign is her only claim to fame). I could not identify Ms. Entwhistle so it is possible that her scenes ended up on the cutting room floor.Ricardo Cortez plays the detective although he usually was cast as a villain, mob boss or gigolo. He doesn't appear until late in the film which might also say something about the cutting of part of the story. C.Henry Gordon, a stalwart in 1930s film, plays a swami advising Loy with his usual panache. She has her way with him eventually adding to the body count.It's true that the film is dated and a bit overwrought but for my money it is a good entry into the early RKO thriller category"], "tt0023640": ["Paul Wegener, in his first talkie film, plays an evil inventor who is pursued by investigative journalist (Harald Paulsen) through four famous horror tales. The first is based on Edgar Allen Poe's 'The Black Cat'. Wegener kills his wife and hides her behind a wall in his basement. The reporter, who hears the wife's screams as he is passing by, calls in the police days later after she is reported missing. The journalist and the police eventually find her body thanks to her meowing cat, which was also accidentally walled with the body.The inventor escapes, only to hide in a wax museum (spoofing Paul Leni's 'Waxworks'), where a sinister game of cat and mouse develops. The chase soon moves to an asylum (taken from another Poe story, 'The System of Dr. Tarr and Prof. Fether') and later, to a strange gentlemen's club which runs a sinister suicide game (from Robert Lewis Stevenson's 'The Suicide Club').This is a remake of the director's own 'Eerie Tales' (1919), which also included adaptations of 'The Black Cat' and 'The Suicide Club'. All three stories here have been filmed since as well - 'Tales of Terror' (1962), 'Curse of the Stone Hand' (1964) and 'Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon' (1973) stand out as examples \u2013 so this may all feel quite familiar. Despite this, it's still very entertaining.The novel approach of linking the separate well-known short stories into one adds a new dimension to the horror anthology sub-genre. It's intended as a spoof of Germany Expressionism, but while it may not exactly have your sides splitting, it still works as a creepy, atmospheric melodrama.It's always fun to see Wegener, whose three silent portrayals of the Golem have ensure his place in horror history. He's great here as the villain; his stony face and narrow eyes make him appear every bit the devious killer. The rest of the less well-known cast do well too.Austrian Director Oswald, who is accredited with directing the first vampire film in 1916 ('A Night of Horror' - now lost), does a fine job of creating a different atmosphere for each story. Of particular note is the 'Dr. Tarr' segment, in which a whole host of lunatics attempt to put our hero on trial.This is a very difficult film to find which is a real shame. Highly recommended for fans of early horror.", "Richard Oswald uses Harald Paulsen as a reporter in pursuit of German horror star Paul Wegener to stitch together three stories. They are Poe's \"The Black Cat\", his \"The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether\" (as close as Poe came to a comedy) and Robert Louis Stevenson's \"The Suicide Club\".Horror was coming into prominence as a movie genre in the early 1930s. Universal Pictures would begin with its production of FRANKENSTEIN. Wegener who had been appearing in this sort of role since the Teens, was a natural, and the similarities of some of the trial sequence here to that of Lang's M, is worth noting. Oswald, like Lang, had to leave the country eventually, but this doesn't have any political content so far as I can see. I know that standard film history would have it that every German movie from about 1924 on is supposed to be a commentary on fascism, but I don't see it.Unfortunately, while the techniques of movie-making and the performances are fine, the movie is padded. Everyone moves slowly in this movie, and the insane move even slower. The sloth may have been intended to allow the audience the terror of anticipation. Unfortunately, it only rouses a sense of impatience. Twenty minutes could have been cut from this movie by movement and some judicious editing.", "This is a movie that I found thanks to Letterboxd when looking for horror from 1932. I didn't know much about this aside from the title and that it was on YouTube. It wasn't until settling in to make sure I had the right movie that I saw it was from Germany and starred Paul Wegener. I recognized him as the director and star from 1920's The Golem. That was about the extent of what I knew.Synopsis: a crazed scientist murders his wife, walls her up and then flees. A reporter sets out to track him down.This movie starts with a couple in a car. The man driving is Frank Briggs (Harald Paulsen). He is a journalist. With him is his fianc\u00e9e, played by Mary Parker. I believe she is a dancer or something along these lines and they're on the way to her performance. As they're going, Frank hears a scream and he wants to investigate. There is only one house in the area and it belongs to Wegener. He lives there with his wife. While working in his laboratory, she comes in with her cat. An accident happens, destroying what he's working on. He kills her in his anger.Frank shows up and Wegener sends him away. He gets the police involved when he learns Wegener's wife is missing. Wegener is brash and annoyed with the cops being there. They make a grisly discovery that causes him to go on the run. Frank is hot on his trail. It leads him to a mental hospital with a dark truth and to a secret society where its members want to commit suicide.That is where I'm going to leave my recap for this movie as I don't want to spoil things. This one is also difficult due to a lack of character names for people and they are also in German. Regardless, I enjoyed this movie. In the opening credits I saw that this was based off a couple Edgar Allan Poe's short stories as well as combining elements from Robert Louis Stevenson's The Suicide Club. I never heard of this last one, but I'm now intrigued. We are also getting The Black Cat from Poe as well. The other story from him is one that I'm not familiar with and doesn't seem to be adapted much. It is interesting is that we would see Roger Corman do this with Poe stories, or just slapping the names of them on his movies, but this is what Brian De Palma would do with like Body Double or Phantom of the Paradise. What I mean here is taking elements and combining them together. It makes sense when dealing with short stories since they would need to be lengthened to make a feature.To delve a bit deeper into this, I was explore the character of Wegener. He is credited as M\u00f6rder which I'm guessing is murderer. This character is diabolic. He is a mad scientist for one. I'm not sure what experiment he is working on when he gets mad at his wife, but he snaps. What I also like about him is that he's arrogant, which we see with the police when he comes to Wegener's house. There is also this odd sequence at the mental hospital which was quite creepy. I'll come back to that shortly. It shouldn't come as a shock, but Wegener's character also runs this secret society. This is where he becomes a Bond villain. I know that Fu Manchu serials and movies were out, so I'm wondering if that influenced here. Wegener's look and intensity he brings to the role is spot on for me. I wanted to make sure that was known.Now there's not a lot to the story, but I did want to go over to the more important set pieces. The first is the mental hospital. Wegener goes in and hides when he flees from the police. Frank goes in as well. When he goes upstairs, we see people begging to be let out. The 'doctors' claim that they're all mad. What is terrifying here though, the people in the rooms might be the doctors and nurses. There is a dinner scene that pulled my attention. It is tense. The other one would be the suicide club. I think from this point, the movie is conveying an anti-suicide message from how things play out. This is a dark subject to deal with where all these characters who are members are waiting to see if they draw the ace of spades and for their time. We see that some want it to come up, while others not so much. This makes me want to see what elements were taken from the Stevenson story.Next, I will take this over to the acting. I've already said my piece on Wegener. I thought that Paulsen was solid as the counterpart to him and our hero. He goes through a lot for this story, I will say that. While looking at the cast list, I saw Eugen Kl\u00f6pfer as Chefarzt. I took German as my foreign language in college and I remember that arzt is doctor, making him the chief. He is creepier with how things play out. I would say that the acting across the board is good, especially for those in the hospital and the club we go to later.The last things then would be with the filmmaking. I'd say that the cinematography is fine. It is early in cinema do they don't do a lot that stood out. I did like the sets from Wegener's house to the mental hospital and then to the secret club later. They were all good. The latter has an interesting set up when it shows how those that draw this card are killed. It is a bit out there, but I commend the movie for trying what it did. It is a bit futuristic, which I can always appreciate. Other than that, the soundtrack was fine for what was needed.In conclusion, this is a movie I had never heard of and I thought that it was an interesting watch. I like that the movie is combing a couple Poe stories with a Stevenson one. It makes for some intriguing set pieces. There is dark subject matter that gets explored, something I wouldn't necessarily expect for the era. I thought that Wegener is solid as our lead, Paulsen is good as his counterpart and the rest of the cast was solid for what was needed. The filmmaking was fine as well. If I did have an issue, it ran too long and I lost interest for a stretch. Regardless, I found this to be an above average movie. I would revisit this to see what I might have missed now that I've seen it as well.My Rating: 7 out of 10.", "GHASTLY TALES (1932, original title Unheimliche Geschichten, aka UNHOLY TALES, THE LIVING DEAD) is another German horror anthology and essentially a remake of the 1919 film EERIE TALES. I read that this one was intended as a spoof but it's hard for audiences to tell that these days, as aside from some exaggerated performances it's all played straight and with a maximum of spooky atmosphere. I largely enjoyed it, especially the wraparound story which involves a reporter pursuing a murder through various tableaus; it reminded me of Wes Craven's SHOCKER of all things.The first story is the best, a creepy reworking of Poe's standby classic THE BLACK CAT, featuring Paul Wegener - who you may remember playing the Golem - on top form. The second is THE SYSTEM OF DR TARR AND PROFESSOR FETHER, another Poe story and an asylum-set comedy this time around, which I felt went on a bit too long for its own good. The final segment reworks Stevenson's THE SUICIDE CLUB to strong effect. There's also a great little sequence (inspired by the silent classic WAXWORKS) full of creepy automated mannequins which I thought was another highlight. I caught this one on Youtube having seen it featured in Jonathan Rigby's EURO GOTHIC and I recommend it to fans of German expressionist cinema.", "The format for Tales of the Uncanny (AKA The Living Dead) is an unusual one: it's based on several tales by Edgar Allen Poe and Robert Louis Stevenson (with a bit of 1924 silent film Waxworks thrown in for good measure), but rather than take a traditional anthology route, the result is an amalgamation of the stories, each segueing into the next, with the antagonist and protagonist the common thread running through the whole thing.The film opens with a version of the oft-told Poe story The Black Cat: journalist Frank Briggs (Harald Paulsen) investigates the case of a missing woman after hearing a scream one night while driving with his fianc\u00e9e. Leading the police to the house where he heard the scream, he discovers that the occupant, M\u00f6rder (Paul Wegener), has killed his wife and walled her up in the basement. M\u00f6rder escapes and hides out in a wax museum, with Briggs hot on his tail; the pair have a fight in the museum, but M\u00f6rder manages to get away once again, this time seeking refuge in an asylum.The next part of the film is based on Poe's The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether (see also Juan L\u00f3pez Moctezuma's House of Madness), for when Frank arrives at the asylum, he discovers that the lunatics have escaped, locked up the staff, and are now in charge of the place. This film may be a spoof of the genre, but the scene where Briggs is grabbed by the crazies and sentenced to death is genuinely frightening.Thankfully, the police arrive in time to save Frank, but M\u00f6rder vanishes again. Briggs gets to meet his nemesis six months later when he investigates a 'suicide club' (this part based on Stevenson's The Suicide Club), where rich people gamble with their lives. M\u00f6rder is head of the club, and forces Briggs to play.The freewheeling lunacy of the film is a lot of fun, and director Richard Oswald successfully balances the chills and thrills with the comedy whilst delivering some memorable moments with some great production design: the automated wax museum is inventive and very entertaining, and M\u00f6rder's HQ at the suicide club features a cool Bond-style booby-trapped chair and an amazing clock to countdown Briggs final minutes."], "tt0023649": ["\"Vampyr\", one of the first horror movies with sound, is the work of the highly influential danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer. After directing the monumental \"La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc\" in 1928, Dreyer decided to make this modest film based on the novel \"In a Glass Darkly\" by Sheridan Le Fanu; while this is indeed his first movie with sound, it was conceived as a silent film, and the movie contains very few dialog.I must admit that as many, I was left with a big question mark in my face as the story was progressing; but the apparently disjointed storyline do make sense, as it is worked as a surreal experience of the lead character, it is as if Dreyer had filmed a nightmare, complete with the haunting images and eerie atmosphere.The movie is about a traveler, named Allan Grey (Julian West), who gets involved in a nightmarish plot when the owner of the inn where he is staying asks him for help to save his family from what he believes is a vampire. We follow Allan Grey in his surrealistic trip to madness as he finds out more and more about the supposed vampire that haunts the manor turned inn.The highly inventive camera work is truly outstanding, the combination of light and darkness is among the finest work in a black & white film and alone makes the movie worth a look; the movie not only has the structure of a nightmare, it also looks like one. The Gothic manor and the lonely rural exteriors increase the haunting atmosphere and the beautiful images Dreyer conceived are the work of a genius.The structure of the script may be complicated, but it shows its influence over David Lynch and other filmmakers with similar surrealist story lines and dreamlike sequences. It is probably not a masterpiece of the likes of the aforementioned \"Passion\" or the more well-known \"Day of Wrath\" (Vredens dag, 1943), but \"Vampyr\" shines with its own light as one of the finest horror movies of that period.The only real flaw in my opinion, was that the lead actor, Julian West, was probably not the best choice for a lead role, as his acting seems unnatural and not believable. I'm not sure if this was intended that way or had more to do with the fact that West produced the film, but it is my only complain about \"Vampyr\".This modest masterpiece is a must see for any horror fan or anyone who likes silent movies. It is a nightmarish trip to the darker parts of the subconscious mind. 8/10", "I can't improve on the fine reviews of the movie itself, but there are two major factors connected with the making of the film that may have been overlooked.If by \"poor quality,\" the reference is to the washed out, somewhat spotty look of the print, please be aware that this was deliberate. Cinematographer Matt\u00e9 had accidently opened a can of exposed film, and when Dreyer saw the result, he was delighted. It was just the effect he had been looking for.\"Vampyr\" was originally shot as a silent. It was only later half-dubbed with voice-overs. Again, however, like the fortuitous \"damage\" to the print, the sparse and somewhat vague, even incoherent, dialogue contributes to the sense of dislocation which, I believe, is one of the great virtues of this genre masterpiece.Like many, the first time I saw \"Vampyr\" I was put off by its obscurity and, yes, the \"mutilated\" video and audio. But as I saw more Dreyer and learned to stop trying to deconstruct the thing, I really began to like it. Now, I love it. If your first viewing of \"Vampyr\" leaves you the way it left me the first time, don't give up on it. It's on video, so buy a copy and pick your moments to watch it. You'll be rewarded.An aside: Julian West, who played the lead, was also backer of the film and is credited, along with Dreyer, as producer. He is said to have been as spacey in real life as he was in character.", "Brilliant!  Breathtaking!  This film was worth the long wait I imposed on myself to see it.  It is not the most cohesive narrative about, but it has images that linger with you....haunt you.  The film is basically a silent with some speaking.  It tells a story about Allan Grey and how he was introduced into a vampire's conspiracy to kill two sisters.  Grey is brought in for aid by their father who dies while trying to fight the infection coursing through his daughter's veins.  What then follows is pure cinematic magic as Grey...opening a book that the father wrote was to be opened upon his death...begins reading the book on vampires whilst it is going on right around him.  The mixture of action and the text from the book create a wonderfully eerie atmosphere and convey a feeling of dread and despair. There are many scenes in Vampyr, directed with fluidity by Carl Dreyer, that are incredibly well-done.  The dream sequence in particular explores various camera angles, hitherto not used.  As I said before, it is not the tightest story and it has some gaping holes in the plot that are never explained, but that really is not very important because the film succeeds as a film of haunting imagery...fear based on illusion and shadows.", "Carl Theodor Dreyer will always be a household name among directors for me after viewing his Passion of Joan of Arc, one of the most emotionally wrenching, stylistically groundbreaking, and thoughtful of religious treatises.  There not only did he reveal the eye of a cinematic genius, but he also had Renee Falconetti, one of only several people to truly pull off a performance by using the eyes to talk more than the voice.  So, I read up on Dreyer and found that he also directed several sound films after the tragedy that was the butchering and loss of Joan of Arc.  One of them was this film, a piece of experimental horror/mystery dealing with the supernatural, the occult, the damned- Vampires.The story at times becomes a little too hard to follow, even beside the point that the film is meant to be surreal or nightmarish or what-have-you. What I did make out of it was that a man named Allan Gray (Julian West) somehow gets lured by his own curiosity comes upon a chateau where an old man (Maurice Schultz, one of the finest hair/face-styling jobs I've seen in an old-style horror movie) and his two daughters reside.  Inter-cutting between excerpts of a book detailing the ABC's of vampire facts, bizarre and sad occurrences go on in the chateau, both to Alan and one of the daughters.I suppose saying that the film at times veers off into haunting imagery is almost a compliment, but for some audiences this could be a turn off.  On top of the fact that the film contains fewer lines than in any other vampire film I can think of, the whole tone and look of the film is, not to put a snob touch on it, unique.  This would not likely be the kind of film to hang out with adolescent friends and drink beers to (that kind of film in the genre would be From Dusk Till Dawn).  The one minor flaw in the film as well is, unlike Joan of Arc, the performances are less than brilliant, outside of the girl in the bed and at times West (Schultz, while believable in the look of the character, is a little too 'shocked' in most scenes).But what the film has going for it are two main elements- Dreyer and Joan of Arc cinematographer Rudolph Mate.  Despite the film, when being viewed today on video and DVD, having a low-quality transfer with specks and scratches and all, nearly every image and camera move is perfect.  For this kind of film, Dreyer takes an approach that lends the story and characters to another plane- these are people caught in the grip of a force that only has one purpose, to kill in a controlled state.  Certain scenes are like terrifying little masterpieces of gothic torture- the droplets of blood falling onto the ground from the bed; the coffin point of view of the world; the close-ups; the way Dreyer moves around the chateau and outside; the creepy, somehow appropriate over/under exposure of shots.  Overall, this is definitely a horror film with a an artist that doesn't sell himself short of the goods in his arsenal.Vampyr is recommendable, if for nothing else (however the story seems like it would be easier to figure out on a repeat viewing, it would lessen the effect it leaves the first time), for the sheer vision.  Although it has dated, Dreyer's take on the myths and terror of a group of citizens held in the grip of a vampire's grip is a technical landmark, and one of the early essentials alongside Nosferatu and Dracula.  The dreadful score by Zeller is a good touch as well.  A", "The major figure of Carl Theodor Dreyer is one of a select group of directors deemed 'transcendental' along with the likes of Ozu and Bresson. Paul Schrader and other critics identify them as those filmmakers who habitually suggest spiritual intensity by ordinary means. Characteristically austere, often using non-professional talent in their films, they find universal truths through a gradual un-dramatic revelation of interior life. All this means in this context is that one would think such directors far away from the flashy supernaturalism and ghastly melodrama normally making up so much of the traditional horror film, a genre where its the extraordinary providing the revelation for the audience, not the mundane. But then one remembers that both Dreyer and Bresson made memorable versions of Joan of Arc, where their representing of terrifying events showed how disturbing an emotionally stark and restrained approach could prove. And, in 1932, about as the first great Universal horror cycle was getting into its stride in Hollywood, Dreyer made his Vampyr.It is interesting to compare Dreyer's great work with that of Murnau, the only other great director who made a broadly comparable title. Both the German director and the Dane took their inspiration from literary horror classics. Murnau based his Nosferatu (1922) on Dracula while, for his inspiration, Dreyer too turned to an English author: Sheridan le Fanu and his novel Carmilla. But the evil thrill of Nosferatu is that it takes place in a concrete 'reality' of sorts, ghostly special effects notwithstanding. By contrast Vampyr is a strange, dreamlike film, one virtually silent or subdued, despite its soundtrack. Moreover it mainly exists in variable prints, the poor state of which merely adds to the strange dislocatedness of unfolding events portrayed. Dreyer's terror lies in a world of shadows, surreality amplified by some remarkable cinematography, the roots of nightmare ever subtle, where camera movement can excite as much dread and anticipation as any vampire out clawing at a victim.Vampyr's story, such as it is, tells of Allan Grey (Julian West), a man studious of vampires. In a small French town, he takes a room at an inn. His sleep is interrupted when a strange man (Maurice Shutz) comes into his room speaking disturbingly about death, then leaves a small package with instructions that it should be opened upon his death. Allen gets out of bed, and prowls around the inn and its spooky surroundings in search of an explanation. Eventually he wanders onto a nearby estate where he finds the mysterious man living with his two daughters. A vampire has bitten one of his daughters, and the house is shrouded in death...Once seen and felt, the peculiarly eerie atmosphere that characterises Dreyer's work is never forgotten. Indeed, Vampyr's influence arguably began at once, for a similar tone of silent mystery pervades some scenes in White Zombie, incidentally one of Bela Lugosi's best, made just the same year - another film which made in sound which often plays like a silent. Like Vampyr, White Zombie includes several wordless sequences which are startlingly eerie and atmospheric. (Both this and present film are much better than Tod Browning's famous version of Dracula also made at about the same time, which these days seem positively wooden by comparison.) And, years later, Ken Russell was to mimic the premature burial sequence of Vampyr, glass windowed coffin and all, in his uneven Mahler while arguably a similar, dreamlike, touch can be found in the work of the French horror auteur Jean Rollin, who in the 1970s made of soft tinted vampirism almost a genre of its own.Of his original film Dreyer said, \"I wanted to create the daydream on film\u0085 to show that horror is not a part of the things around us, but of our own subconscious mind.\" To help achieve this, he and his cameraman Rudolph Mate shot much very early in the morning and frequently through fine gauze - a creative decision increasing the sense of mystery surrounding events. The resultant shimmer and softness which fell over scenes suggests the supernatural confusion felt by the hero, and add a spooky disconnectedness to events. Allied to this, as already noted, this is a work where one is acutely aware of camera placement and movement, of shadow and light. Dreyer's sensitive direction means that the lens becomes a lurking accompaniment to Grey's, and therefore our, unease.Main actor Julian West, who also financed a lot of the picture, makes a suitable impression; part of the mood in what is his only significant film. Forty years later he again appeared again on screen, but with less impact. In retrospect nothing could compare to his appearance here, his pale, Lovecraftian features perfectly in tune with the gloomy goings on. His anonymous freshness as an actor makes of him an everyman, a dramatic unknown fitting in exactly with the director's preferred casting with the undemonstrative and normal. And unlike Nosferatu's celebrated settings of castles, doom laden ships and spectral carriages, Vampyr's unease is primarily set amidst the domestic: an inn, a to-do private home or in common place out-buildings.Dismayed by distracting subtitles, often faded visuals and poor soundtrack elements, admirers of Dreyer's masterpiece have long cried out in vain for a restored version, especially now that the later films of the director have been reissued. Even such earlier silents such as the lesser, decidedly more obscure, Master Of The House (1925) have lately arrived with a five star treatment on disc. Whether or not this lapse is due to a fatal absence of original materials I am not sure, but fans of one of the very finest horror films, and a rare one by a great director to boot, will not be satisfied until this Vampyr at least is resurrected and given the new life it deserves.", "Vampyr is the strange and dream-like tale of Allan Gray, seeker of the supernatural, encountering a case of vampirism in a small French village. Images of ghost-like forms flit across a small river, shadows detach themselves from their owners and move around of their own accord; astral forces impinge upon this never-world and at the heart of all the horror is a crone-like vampire, preying on the life blood of a young girl.For those used to a narrative story-telling style of cinema - well, you'd better forget it right here. Much is left unexplained, characters wander in and out of the film with no introduction, and in one sequence in particular the astral shade of the hero departs his body and witnesses it being placed in a coffin and buried, while the vampire and her slaves look in through the glass face plate. This scene has an eerie power that is unforgettable.Many modern viewers will no doubt dismiss Vampyr as slow and boring; certainly the film takes some effort to absorb. However the oneiric flavour of the piece will come to haunt you; you will feel yourself becoming a part of this shadow-realm as you watch. You can ignore the sudden shifts in both language and conversation - everyone seems to be on the verge of saying something important, and then stops. Indeed sometimes the dialogue makes no logical sense. It is the pervading mood that is important rather than the story, or lack of it.But what you are left with is a feeling of evil incarnate in the form of the vampire, and perhaps it's her influence that turns the film into this compelling and starkly imaged nightmare. Once seen Vampyr is never forgotten, but it certainly isn't for everyone.Quick update - I have now seen the German version (with subtitles) of this movie and there were a lot of cuts to the English version which make the plot a lot more obscure. I recommend catching the subtitled version - clears up a lot!", "Simply: it's beautiful work of art. No action. No slasher scenes. There is almost less speaking then in Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki's films. Master of silent movie, Carl Th. Dreyer, uses more silent film magic than any spoken voices. Movie's style is from another world. Living shadows, ghosts, vampire in the foggy wood and (of course) the famous scene where man watch himself to be buried alive. There is no way you can say what this film is true and what dream. It's like Dreyer would have put he's own dream in to the screen. Nobody have done anything like this later, perhaps because the gray light that is all the time in the film came by an accident. There is no movie like this and no way there is another horror movie like this! Vampire- movie fan can watch this with F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu. They are different film's, but strange way spooky at same way.", "With its fragmented plot, eerie imagery, and air of undefined menace this film more nearly realises the dream state than any other film I've seen.The story, which follows a young man's discovery of vampiric doings while on a trip to the country, is secondary to the fascinatingly uncanny mood generated by the cinematography and effective use of sound and silence.Yes, yes, it's old and unconventional, and requires either some extra concentration or complete surrender to its unique world, but the effort is worth it.Vampyr should especially appeal to fans of cinefantastique, cinema history and maybe even the arthouse crowd.", "For a movie made in 1932, this is very, very impressive. Confusing plot aside, the emphasis in this Victorian nightmare is placed on the cinematic aspects. \"Vampyr\" is plodding, very dark and eerie, filled with such haunting atmosphere and brooding visuals full of unseen, but lurking terror - very effecting.  It works on a subconscious and emotional level more than any other way. I think it's worth a look.", "When you hear the word \" masterpiece \" you often have to take cover to the hyperbolic superlatives aimed at that film . Has there ever been any film released that hasn't had someone screaming \" MASTERPIECE \" . I think someone have said WORLD WAR Z was a masterpiece of Zombie horror . Someone said TRANSFORMERS is a masterpiece of explosions and CGI whilst someone else said PACIFIC RIM was a masterpiece in toilet cleaners . Maybe and why not ? VAMPYR by Carl Thedor Dryer is another film considered a masterpiece in 2013 but a quick internet search will inform you that the film was booed by everyone who saw it 80 years ago and it's easy to see why when you stop to think about itPicture the scene . It's 1932 and you're sat in the cinema a cigarette in one hand and a bag of pop corn in another . Sound is a recent invention and you're still reeling from James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN from the previous year and this film promises to match if not surpass the spine chilling shock of Whale's movie . The film starts and you notice something very strange - hardly anyone talks . Protagonist Allen Grey walks around and insert cards inform us he's an expert academic in the undead . Hold on wait a minute didn't we get caption inserts in silent movies ? Surely we've moved on ? As the story continues we get spooky images of ghost like figures . Slightly impressive but didn't we get that from that French bloke Georges Melies ? What's happening now ? More caption inserts where nobody says anything . Whoa you expect us to pay for a cinema ticket at 1932 prices and what you're doing is showing us a film that looks like it was made 20 years ago ! Surely there is a consumer protection act here somewhere that states if you spend money on a cinema ticket in 1932 then you're entitled to see a film that looks like it was made in 1932 . Pop corn is then thrown at the screen . All together now \" BOOOOOOO \"When you watch this in 2013 you'll almost certainly be in two minds about it . One is you'll be impressed by the atmospheric mood of VAMPYR that is truly expressionistic . However that's perhaps the only impressive aspect to the film where everything else is lacking . The narrative has an implausible structure , things go unexplained and after the story reaches its natural climax there seems to be another ten minutes added that seem to have come from a different film . The lighting in the film is good but apart from that the camera-work is rather static . No doubt this is a film that is essential viewing in film classes but apart from that you can understand why some people had a very negative reaction to it in 1932", "Too often horror films are thought of as light-weight entertainment. Even the best are under-appreciated for what they can tell us about human nature. In the case of Carl Dreyer's \"Vampyr,\" however, all you seem to hear is high-brow rhetoric about how the film's dream-like illogic makes it a meditation upon death. For just once forget all the intellectual mumbo-jumbo and watch this film for what it is, one creepy little flick and the pioneering vampire film of the '30s. It was in production a year before \"Dracula\" but released the year after, and is a better and scarier film, unless bats on strings scare you.It's not a silent movie but feels like one - an exceptionally fine one. So if you are put off by non-talking films be warned, dialog is spare, cut to the bone; but the musical score is very good and sinister. The main attractions are the images: shadows that kill people, a spirit that leaves its body, a corpse-eye view of a burial, and other uncanny occurrences that lead young Allan Grey to a girl suffering from a mysterious illness, and to her doctor, a vampire's accomplice who supplies his crone-like patroness with fresh victims.Possibly the film's poor reception by critics and audiences was because the 1930 soundtrack was too primitive to be appreciated by viewers in 1932, who by then were used to lots of chatter - and because the earlier release of \"Dracula\" blunted its impact. But with little dialog and without the stagnating influence of a stationary microphone our eyes feast on Hermann Warm's eerie art direction, and are guided by Rudolph Mate's camera, which keeps us off balance, misdirecting our point of view as when it pans to a door through which a nurse exits her patient's room, then pans back again to reveal an empty bed just before the victim's sleep-walking rendezvous with the vampire.The film bears even less resemblance to its source (Sheridan Le Fanu's \"Carmilla\") than \"Dracula\" does to Stoker's novel, possibly because it borrows from another story, Mary Elizabeth Braddon's \"Good Lady Ducayne,\" in which a young man comes to the aid of a young paid female companion of an extremely aged woman whose doctor draws the young woman's blood for his patient to consume. And if \"Vampyr's\" plot often seems incoherent, so does \"Dracula's.\" The performances, however, are vastly superior. Sybille Schmitz in particular, as the vampire's victim, conveys with her subtle expressions emotions for which spoken language is inadequate.For those who already know this film, Martin Koerber's restoration on the Criterion release eliminates the large, black-bordered, Gothic subtitles, and corrects the too-bright day-for-night scenes that were so distracting on the Image disc. For others seeing \"Vampyr\" for the first time, relax, don't think too much, and enjoy!", "A conventionally Gothic vampire movie?  A Surrealist dreamscape?  A Borgesian labyrinth?  A study of identity and its dissolution?  A Christian parable about innocence and evil?  A dramatisation of the mind?  Too many horror films are unworthy of the name.  They may have genuine scares and surprises, but their horrors are comfortingly contained in genre, in a recognisable place, with recognisable characters - the source of the horror is either crushed or resuscitated for the sequel, and if you actually await the return of a horror, it's not very horrible (honorable exceptions include THE SHINING, REPULSION).If you were to use one word to describe the director of DAY OF WRATH and ORDET, it would not be generic.  And yet many of his admirers are slighttly embarrassed that he followed his shattering, spiritual masterpiece THE PASSION OF JEANNE D'ARC with a Victorian potboiler.  The ingrediants are depressingly familiar to anyone who's seen even half a dozen horror films - a Westernised foreigner (played by the film's aristocratic financier; this is not it's only point in common with Cocteau's THE BLOOD OF A POET) with an interest in the supernatural visits Eastern Europe; he stays in a decaying mansion-turned-inn where mysterious events occur, involving girls in trances, vampires and mad doctors.The problem with most horror films is that they are too neat - their forms do not embody a content filled with decay, dismemberment, sensation, confusion, ambiguity, inexplicability.  Anyone in love with Dreyer's formal purity will be shocked by how 'messy' VAMYPYR seems.  Much of this may be the fault of the poor print I saw - a bleached frame that makes the credits illegible (although Mate's filtered blinding lighting is one of the sources of the film's unease); disjointed editing that suggests an ornery distributor's hand; the feel that this print is actually an assemblage of different prints - German language scenes alternate with dubbed English ones, the music seems to halt with jarring regularity.Normally this kind of vandalism is simply unacceptable to any work by a master, but somehow this butchery adds to the film's enigma.  The film IS a Surrealist dreamscape - the mansion has no social reality, it is a rarefied space through which wander dreamlike characters.  The images frequently have no narrative basis, but together create a chilling oneiric atmosphere - the bellringer with the scythe; the repeated motif of active shades; the waltz of the shadows, one of the most remarkable, unaccountable scenes in all cinema.The film is also a labyrinth on many levels.  Its hero is not one in the active, heroic sense - he wanders as if 'impelled', he is always looking on, or too late, and when he finally tries to act he succumbs to possible evil, the blood seeped out of him, his wholeness divided, until he finally watches from his own funeral.  He spends most of the film walking, through corridors, stairs, doorways, out in the sheds and meadows, always framed, minimised, going nowhere, as in a maze, right back to where he started from.The gliding camerawork, complex and astonishing still today, unthinkable in the stagy, clumpy early days of sound cinema, makes the fixed house, decor, genre seem fluid, unstable, alive.  The film's structure is labyrinthine too - narrative traits begin and are quickly dropped, or simply don't make sense, becoming non-sequiters.  The 'reality' of the film is thoroughly undermined - we have difficulty separating the real and the imagined/dreamed, the innocent and the guilty.  Plot, linear, frequently evaporates into unconnected imagery, circular, a series of motifs.  The film itself, Dreyer's first sound film, features little dialogue, and is in many ways shot like a silent, with intertitles, stylised acting, and flickering, chiaroscuro imagery, further making ambiguous the status of what we see, the music and sound effects being vital.Unlike most horror films, VAMPYRE does not move towards explanation of mystery and resolution of rupture.  On the contrary, it is increasingly baffling, and if the big house in horror movies is often a signifier for the mind, then what we are watching is surely a visualisaiton of madness and breakdown.  And yet the vampire plot itself seems to suggest peace and redemption to at least one of the sufferers.  Whatever the meaning(s) of this quite extraordinary and beautiful film, you can bet the le Fanu novel isn't a patch on it.", "It is understandable that many take issue with Vampyr due to an absence of conventional moviemaking factors that make an average film watchable. However, I believe that this is more a problem of the viewer than one with the filmmaker, and it all begins with whether or not one watches expecting to be frightened in a generic horror flick manner. This is not a scary movie; it is one that fundamentally blurs the lines between dreams and reality.  It is not a silent film or a talkie, but something in between, and that fits in perfectly with the idea of it being an experience much like a bad dream. There are few professional actors (two, in fact, and neither would be considered the leading actors), and long takes that would drive a Hollywood film editor to distraction.  They are selected more for their appearance and natural manner than for any exceptional gift as an actor/actress, and it is my belief that that adds more than detracts from the experience.  The reactions of the characters are far more visceral and simple than in most films of this depth, and it helps create the mesmerizing, hypnotic effect few movies can create. It is designed, I believe, to be seen in a dark room, preferably alone and late at night, just prior to going to bed.  If the viewer is a little sleepy, so much the better: for the true power of the film will only be revealed as you dwell on it afterwards while you struggle to go to sleep.  Then,and only then, will the full might of Carl Theodore Dreyer's vision be revealed.", "\"Vampyr\" is unlike any other movie ever made, and certainly unlike any other \"horror\" movie ever made. It's a spectral masterwork in which poetic audiovisual allusions create suggestions of events, as in the scene where the shadows get up and dance, or the ghostly scene when the vampire strikes her victim. It is a film of atmosphere, of light and shadow, played out on themes of death and rebirth.", "A traveler obsessed with the supernatural visits an old inn and finds evidence of vampires.I should note that the version of this film I watched (the first time) was on Netflix. I do not know where they get their copy from. My understanding is that this film is generally found pieced together from various versions. The Netflix one is of below average image quality, and the English subtitles take up a fair amount of the screen for no particular reason.The second time, I rented the Criterion Collection DVD, which is certainly a significant improvement and I would recommend watching it in this way. Judging a film by a poor version of it is not fair to the original creators.That being said, as a fan of classic German films and of horror in general, I am a bit biased in favor of this one. Carl Dreyer is not my favorite of the early directors (that distinction is up for grabs, but may fall to Murnau), but he is far from my least. There is no one else really notable attached to this film except Dreyer -- no important cinematographer or actor. Yet, it works. Amateur actors, location shooting and poor audio recording... and it works.Dreyer's first \"talkie\", and it uses very little dialogue because Dreyer had managed to master telling the story through images alone (his \"Joan of Arc\" is very expressive). He has an uncanny use of shadows, and is able to expertly switch between objective and subjective perspectives.", "I don't know if any film has portrayed the emotion of despair so succinctly as this film. Everything in the movie seems dead or dying, and the characters are confused and melancholy, desperately trying to escape from something that is never explicitly shown. It says something about the timelessness of this movie that I stumbled across it on t.v. one night and couldn't figure out when it was made, anywhere between the 30s and 70s. This movie is so real that it's like watching an old home movie that someone left in the attic decades ago, almost like Blair Witch Project; I think this is the effect that Dreyer was shooting for, because there is no real storyline, and the actors are so self-absorbed that you're convinced they inhabit the special world portrayed in the film. Strange voices in multiple languages pop up out of nowhere. A young woman lying on a bed suffering from the effects of a vampire suddenly springs up and eyes her sister hungrily. These creepy scenes are interspersed with David Gray's reading of the strange little book the old man left for him. There are no real special effects, but watching disembodied shadows dancing across a field, on their way to some dark business, are enough to make your flesh crawl.I can see how modern viewers might be put off by the pace and incongruity of this movie, but patience and a second viewing (especially on a cold, rainy night) will yield some spine-chilling moments. Don't think about it too hard when you're watching, just let the movie do the work, even if it seems slow. You don't even have to like vampire movies. This is horror stripped of the facade of acting, and the underpinnings that are so apparent in modern films are refreshingly absent here. Blair Witch Project was exactly like this: the sense that you are watching something real, which I think is the most disturbing thing about this movie.", "A 1932 Danish horror film. The plot is somewhat vague--something about a man named Allan Grey (Julien West) who stumbles upon a village where an evil vampire woman is in control. He tries to help two sisters--Leone (Sybille Schmitz) and Gisele (Rena Mandel) who are threatened by her.It's not really scary (or coherent) and VERY slowly paced but the film looks incredible. Light, shadow and camera angles are the main thing here--story is secondary. The film has a very creepy, dreamlike feel to it that's hard to shake. It's a sound film but there's very little dialogue--the images carry the story. It is very dull at times (the skimpy story and some bad acting doesn't help) but the visuals are so striking that you tend to overlook that...there are just so many incredible images. Also there is one good performance by Sybille Schmitz as one of the vampire's intended victims. When she falls under the spell of the vampire you see her face quickly switch from sadness to evil. This is not for the casual horror viewer. However, if you have patience and are willing to work with the film you'll find it works on you.", "Despite having dialogue this feels very much like a silent film. This dated, spooky little gem concentrates on visual imagery rather than concentrate dialogue and this fact gives it a dreamy, ethereal quality rarely seen in modern cinema. Indeed the film works best as a series of haunting visual images as our hero experiences weird events, hallucinations, and frightening dreams. Although difficult to watch and not exactly entertaining, VAMPYR is nonetheless a fascinating horror film which taps into some of our deepest fears.Despite having a vampire, this is a film which actually feels like a ghost story due to some spooky scenes of character's spirits coming out of their bodies and walking about in dream states. Exceptional use is made of shadows as they are given lives of their own in a very unsettling way. The acting is understated and efficient, but there is little in the way of a linear plot or storyline - it's just the images, linked together to form a puzzling whole. This is definitely a unique item and a good example of expressionistic cinematography, and it stays in the mind long after viewing.", "Another person said it best in a previous review, \"Vampyr\" is a masterpiece of suggested horror with truly frightening and disturbing scenes throughout. A warning in advance. This is an extremely slow moving picture. It seems to drag and usually that really bothers me but this movie is so full of images, it makes up for it. The movie is subtitled but it hardly matters since there is so little dialogue. The movies unfolds in a strange dream-like state and stays that way throughout. Your not really sure if it is day or night. There are many memorable scenes also. The policeman sitting in his chair moments before his shadow also sits down, the infamous dream burial sequence induced by a blood transfusion and so many more! If you like wonderful images and camerawork as well as a few chills, this film is for you! Highly recommended!", "During the early 1930's in America \"Frankenstein\" 1931 and \"Dracula\" were big hits for screen goers and the European Film Makers decided to make their first film a Dracula film without Bela Lugosi.The director of this picture did not pick famous actors for his characters, he chose ordinary people he knew or met without any acting abilities. In this picture there were only two professional actors hired to play certain key roles. This film has a very dark and deeply spiritual tale with antiques furnished in a very old French castle that was in ruined conditions and neglected, which made a perfect location. This is a very creepy slow moving film, but excellent for the year 1932.", "Vampyr is an excellent historical study of the development of film atmosphere.  Each scene is thick with visual context.  It is eerie and spooky, but also fairly empty.  The plot is minimal so that we can focus on the cinematography.  This is fine, but films do have to have a number of good elements or else they are not successful.  I would rate this film a success, but a minor one.  Nosferatu, Phantom of the Opera (1925) and even Blood of a Poet are far better dream-like efforts.  I believe that the film highlights the fact that the early 1930's were not a good time for film in Europe (in general).  Besides Renoir, most directors were moving to America and doing their best work in Hollywood.  In light of the cesspool that is modern day Hollywood, it is hard to believe that it was ever a leader in world cinema, but at this time it was.  Check out Browning's Dracula or Whale's Bride of Frankenstein and it becomes clear that advances beyond the level of Vampyr had been made.  Still, the film is a textbook display of early film atmosphere and for that it is worth a look.", "I guess pun intended. Moreover though, the movie looks quite stunning (at least in the Criterion Collection I had the pleasure of watching). The framing, the way the shots are set up - especially considering when this was made, it quite amazing if you think about it.The pacing may feel weird for some, the constant text or pages the viewer has to read may annoy some but it is a testament of the time, the movie almost would have been made without sound, first movie of the director where he used sound as the extras are telling us. There is also a lot of material that has been lost - good features on the Disc. It might have been a different even more daring piece of cinema - it didn't work out that way. Still this is quite the movie all things considered, if you can and are willing to do that. Technically it seems ahead of its time, even if that sounds weird or false if you watch it.", "In the last few years, vampires have become a hot topic in movies, although I couldn't understand the plot of the one \"Twilight\" movie that I saw. However, the best vampire films have focused not on blood and guts, but on the ambiance or how the vampire feels about his afterlife (think both \"Nosferatu\" movies). But a lesser known vampire movie is Carl Theodor Dreyer's \"Vampyr\", his first talkie. The movie is less about vampires per se than about the protagonist's dreamlike view of his surroundings.Allan Gray (Nicolas de Gunzburg, using the name Julian West) is a student of the occult who wanders into the town of Courtempierre. In the inn that night, an old man leaves a packet on Gray's table. The packet says \"To be opened in the event of my death\". So begins Gray's journey into a completely surrealistic environment. Adding to the surrealism is the limited dialog, with a lot of title cards explaining the action. But even so, this movie contains some scenes that probably NO OTHER director has shown. Not Jarmusch, not Fellini, not even Truffaut could have figured out how to portray the descent into madness that the protagonist undergoes.Without a doubt, the absence of big stars adds to the surreal feeling elicited by \"Vampyr\". There are no big stars (except for two professional actors), so there's less guarantee that everything will be OK in the end. These individuals experiencing these horrific events could be anyone...including you or me.All in all, this is definitely one that I recommend. True, the film's quality is less than perfect, but that only adds to the dreamlike state. It's sure to haunt you.", "Okay, I'll admit that my summary will cause a few eyebrows to raise and irritate some of the readers and I am perfectly fine with that! I love old-time horror films and have seen practically every one there is to see--so I was very excited to see that this old Danish\\French film was coming on TCM. However, while watching it I just couldn't believe my eyes--it was THAT bad! Instead of a film that was at least the equal to the great horror movies that had preceded it (such as NOSFERATU, THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, Dracula or FRANKENSTEIN), I saw a very, very shoddy production that bored me half to death!This wasn't a very good sound picture technically, as the film really looked like a silent film with some poorly added sound (it was also pretty hard to hear what was being said). Plus, in this English language version, so much of what WAS being said wasn't translated at all--as if the translators didn't think it was worth translating it!! And, the lines were subtitled in HUGE and annoying text blocks that obscured 1/3 of the screen! I actually understood some of these lines but couldn't believe they were left untranslated! And considering I am NOT fluent, I really wished I'd had a group of UN translators with me to help me understand what was said. In addition, while much of the dialog was left untranslated, the film, at times, was like a book! So, long, long, long stretches of the film consisted of page after page of text read by some old guy from a book about vampires! The viewer is allowed to read along with him--again and again. If I wanted to read a book, I would have done so--not watched this film, thank you! This isn't an exaggeration, as in the over 2300 films I have reviewed for IMDb, I have NEVER seen this sort of sloppy and dull work on a captioned film.Okay, now these problems may be due to lousy production values by those who released the film in the English-speaking world and were not due to director, Dreyer--after all, it was not exactly his original vision. However, despite his sterling reputation as a perfectionist and great director, I would beg to differ. The camera-work, at times is brilliant and eerie (the end is magnificent as the man is shown in the coffin--this is the only reason I score the film a 3 and not a 1). However, the story is very, very disjoint, dull and technically the folks at Universal Studios (and even Murnau in 1922 with NOSFERATU) were head and shoulders above this film is just about every way. James Whale, the director for most of the greatest Universal horror films has pretty much been forgotten and the words \"genius\" or \"master\" rarely appear in regard to him, but technically his films were vastly superior to this dull mess concocted by Dreyer. While I am a huge admirer of foreign films, in this case, the American versions are just so much better. I am just so amazed that I hated this film on practically every level. It only improved, somewhat, towards the end, but not enough to make me feel like I hadn't wasted my time. A work of genius? You've got to be kidding! A semblance of a plot, decent characters and dialog and not just a hollow mess of special effects and dull expressions on the actors' faces don't indicate genius,...or even mediocrity for that matter!", "The lone oddity in Dreyer's filmography which usually deals with such lofty topics as faith and the female role, his first sound film is nevertheless one of his finest achievements. Released a good four years after his silent film masterpiece 'The Passion of Joan of Arc', his choice of making a genre film had alienated his admirers who had been expecting something far more ambitious than an adaptation of '''Carmilla''' but time has revealed 'Vampyr' to be among the most dreamlike of Dreyer's films.Allan Gray(Nicholas de Gunzburg) is an adventurer and traveler who's had a particular interest in the occult. He comes to a small town in Eastern Europe for a relaxing stay but things don't turn out very well because of a strong supernatural presence in the midst. The innkeeper where he's at is haunted by beings enslaved by local vampires. The entire area seems to be a kind of hell on earth as their shadows literally make merry. Their latest target are a pair of sisters living nearby whose father they murder but not before entrusting gray with a book on vampires and the safety of his children. Soon however one of them is infected and Gray has 24 hours to rescue her soul.Plots are often not spoken in conjunction with Dreyer's films. For good reason to. His films rely on imagery and atmosphere and mood. 'Vampyr' was his first sound film yet with it's use of intertitles and spare dialogues it feels like a silent film. It would be a good 11 years later when with 'Day of Wrath', Dreyer changed his aesthetic completely doing away with the sparse sets and quick cuts for a tightly constructed mise-en-scene and use of long fluid takes that he has become synonymous with in his three sound masterpieces of 'Day of Wrath', 'Ordet' and 'Gertrud'."], "tt0023694": ["Zombie movies from the '30's and '40's are quite different from the zombie movies most people know from the '70's till present time. In the '30's and '40's, zombies and voodoo kind of rituals always walked hand in hand. As a result of this zombie movies from the '30's and '40's have a certain creepy atmosphere and scary voodoo sound effects.\"White Zombie\" is the very first (still excising) zombie movie ever made. The zombies look extremely good and creepy thanks to the charismatic actors that perform them. Don't underestimate this people, acting with just your body and mostly face is also a form of tough acting. I think that it is thanks to the fine casting of the zombies that most of the scene's with them in it, work really well.Bela Lugosi is totally fantastic as sort of witch doctor and 'king of the zombies'. He plays one scary monsieur. I even tend to say that this is his best villain role he has ever portrayed, yes even better as Count Dracula. Lugosi was always at his best in roles like these and just like in \"Dracula\" he is once more acting very well with also both his hands and face, especially his typical horror-like-eyes make him one legendary villain. For the Lugosi fans this is an absolute must see!The story is very intriguing and sad and its told in a beautiful way. Especially the ending was fantastic and actually also quite tense.Unfortunately time has not been kind on this movie. The movie had been lost for many years until the '60's after acquiring the rights to distribute the movie, the quality was already beyond restoration, so now days we can never watch this movie in its full glory. The movie has the grainy and visual look of movies from the 1920's and at times small chunks of sound and music are missing.The cinematography is absolutely fantastic and the experimental editing provides some unique and extremely well looking sequences. It reminded me of some of Brian De Palma's early work. There is one unique and brilliant scene that I can't even describe. It features a split screen but the scene is constructed more complex than I make it sound. Really something you have to see for yourself.OK maybe the beginning of the movie isn't that good and memorable and quite standard and typical for the horror genre in the '30's but the last half hour or so is really unique, excellent, tense and just a shear delight to watch, mainly thanks to Bela Lugosi's his character 'Murder' Legendre (what a brilliant name by the way) and the story in which once more love conquers all.By the way this is the movie Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi were watching together in the movie \"Ed Wood\". Most people think that it was a Dracula movie with Lugosi but it in fact is this movie they're watching.A really unique little forgotten horror masterpiece, that's worth seeing already alone for its movie historical value and Lugosi's fantastic, passioned villain role.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "A diabolical voodoo master plots to turn a beautiful young American into a WHITE ZOMBIE, a slave of his perverted passions...Here is one of the great unheralded horror classics of the 1930's. Almost forgotten today, it is an excellent example of what can be accomplished by an obscure film company (in this case Halperin Productions) working with a tiny budget, but using enormous flair & imagination. Some of the visuals - the opening scene of the burial on the road, the sugar mill worked by zombies - remain in the imagination for an uncomfortable amount of time, one sure sign of true success for a horror film. Certain of the settings - the hillside graveyard, the villain's towering fortress - are as good as you'll find anywhere. Additionally, the moody music of Xavier Cugat & the make-up wizardry of Jack Pierce help tremendously.But it's the performance of Bela Lugosi, looking utterly satanic, which is truly memorable. Released the year following his celebrated Dracula, WHITE ZOMBIE gives him another character which, in measures of pure menace, is easily the equal of the Count. With his mesmeric eyes, expressive, spider-like hands & wonderfully eerie voice, Lugosi radiates absolute evil. This talented Austro-Hungarian actor (born B\u00e9la Ferenc Dezs\u00f5 Blask\u00f3, 1882-1956) would fritter away much of his career in low-budget dregs, but here he must have realized he was in competent hands and he is obviously having a wonderful time. To see his imposing, cloaked figure stalk about the screen, closely followed by his Living Dead slaves, is to enjoy one of cinema's most deliciously spooky moments.Madge Bellamy & John Harron are both impressive as Lugosi's victims. Robert Frazer is very good indeed as the plantation owner whose obsession for Miss Bellamy throws him right into Lugosi's clutches. Elderly Joseph Cawthorn scores as the aged missionary who may be the only person wise enough to thwart the zombie master. Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Clarence Muse as the frightened coach driver in the opening sequence.", "There's something about 1930s horror movies that makes them really special and haunting. It's probably got a lot to do with the talkies being new and directors being free to experiment with tricks learned from German expressionism. Whatever the explanation the best movies from the early 30s (James Whale's 'Frankenstein', 'Bride Of Frankenstein' and 'The Invisible Man', Todd Browning's 'Dracula' and 'Freaks') have a dreamlike quality that sticks in your brain and just won't leave. Bela Lugosi is one of the icons of horror movies. He made 'White Zombie' not long after 'Dracula', his definitive role, and gives another great performance. 'Island Of Lost Souls' is a better movie than 'White Zombie' but Lugosi on has a small role in that so I'd say this is his best movie after 'Dracula'. It's easy to forget just how quickly his career died. His two mid-30s teamings with Boris Karloff ('The Black Cat' and 'The Raven') were basically the beginning of the end for him as a major star, and by the time he played Ygor in the underrated 'Son Of Frankenstein' at the end of the decade he was almost a has been. Oh well Lugosi is just terrific in this movie as the sinister 'Murder' Legrende, Haitian mill owner and zombie master. Robert Fraser plays Charles Beaumont, a local plantation owner who becomes obsessed with a young woman (Madge Bellamy) about to be married. He invites her and her fiance (John Harron) to his estate to have their wedding all the while planning some way to win her. An hour before the wedding he becomes desperate and reluctantly approaches his sinister neighbour Legrende. Legrende's solution has dire consequences for all involved. The movie was obviously made a shoe string budget but there are plenty of striking visual images, especially those involving Bellamy after Lugosi gets to her. The zombies are very creepy and are the precursors to zombie classics later made by Tourneur, Romero, Fulci and Raimi. For this and for Lugosi 'White Zombie' is a must see for any horror buff!", "White Zombie (1932)*** (out of 4)Young couple Neil (John Harron) and Madeleine (Madge Bellamy) meet a man on a cruise who offers them his mansion to get married in. As soon as they arrive they realize things really aren't normal due to some zombie like people walking around. They eventually meet the man turning these people into zombies, Legendre (Bela Lugosi) who plans on turning the woman.WHITE ZOMBIE is a film that horror fans usually end up in a heated debate about. Some people love every second of the film while others have a hard time reaching the end credits because they fall asleep. To me this film could easily be called an incredibly flawed masterpiece and I think it proves that you don't have to be a great director to create something special. I say this because director Victor Halperin has created some incredibly great moments here but when you take a look at his other films like SUPERNATURAL, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES and TORTURE SHIP, there's none of the \"talent\" on display that you see here. In fact, I think it would be very fair to say that WHITE ZOMBIE is good simply by luck.What I love about the film is its creepy and rather surreal atmosphere. Right from the opening shot you can just feel the darkness of the area and there's no question that you really do feel as if you're in this location and it's a place you'd want to get out of as quick as possible. There are some terrific moments scattered throughout this film but I think one could argue that the opening sequence right up to when we first see Lugosi, is among the best moments in any horror film from this period. There are other great moments including the drum beat that is used throughout the picture and there are some beautiful matte shots of the castle, which are quite haunting.Another great thing going for the film is the performance of Lugosi. Who knows where the truth and the myth goes but after not getting the monster role in FRANKENSTEIN you have to wonder why Lugosi wanted to do such a low-budget film. Again, there are countless theories out there but this role certainly isn't the \"sexy\" role that Dracula was. Lugosi is quite evil here and he manages to do it without every going over-the-top but instead he stays pretty calm and collective throughout. He's given a terrific look and there's no question that the actor knows how to use his eyes to display coldness. The supporting players really aren't all that memorable but each of them are good enough for what they're asked to do.There are many flaws to be found in WHITE ZOMBIE. The film moves at a snail's pace and while this might help the atmosphere, after a while the movie really begins to drag. In fact, I've seen this movie countless times and I always feel like I've accomplished something great when I can make it through in one sitting without falling asleep. Another flaw can be. It's hard to bash the direction for some at times silly looking stuff when you're at the same time praising him for the atmosphere he brings to the picture. WHITE ZOMBIE really is a hard film to judge but it remains an important part of horror history and there are enough strengths to make it worth viewing.", "I'm not entirely sure why this film is considered a horror classic. But having seen many other horror films from the 1930s, I would have to agree it's definitely one of the better ones.The plot: a Frenchman in Haiti makes a deal with Bela Lugosi to turn a beautiful young woman (Madge Bellamy, the finest 1930s woman by far) into a zombie. But then he becomes disillusioned and Bela Lugosi strikes back at the Frenchman. Oh ,and there are other zombies, an absent-minded professor and a really annoying screeching vulture.This film has some of the strangest transitions between scenes. I forget the word for when the screen slides over, but it does it a number of times in short succession in some strange shapes (like curtains, or diagonally). And there is a weird fascination with showing Bela Lugosi' eyes and his hand gestures repeatedly. The eyes reveal what seems to me some of the fakest eyebrows ever glued to a forehead.But if you like Lugosi or classic horror, or Madge Bellamy... yeah, you should see this film. So much crap is pumped out of theaters and studios these days in the horror genre, why not see the roots that inspired all this before it went bad?", "I'm a big Bela Lugosi fan, as well as a sucker for '30s and '40s horror chestnuts in general. But no matter how many times I watch WHITE ZOMBIE, I'm just always a bit short of considering it a \"good\" movie. Lugosi is delightfully weird and mysterious as Murder Legendre, a sinister zombie master who commands a legion of Walking Dead, and who grants a favor to a jealous man by helping him possess the woman he yearns for -- by turning her into a mindless zombie!The surroundings are purely macabre and unsettling. But despite these assets, something goes astray in the snail-like pacing. Some of the acting is hopelessly dated and exaggerated, most notably by con man Robert Frazer and, to a lesser extent, hero John Harron. It's interesting that Lugosi - who's often lambasted by critics for overdoing it himself - is perfectly \"on,\" however.WHITE ZOMBIE is still a \"pretty good\" horror movie in its own right for such a minor production. But it's not a film I would recommend to those younger viewers who tend to feel bored by older classic films.", "WHITE ZOMBIE is one of those rare early talkies where everything fits just right.  Rumours have circulated for years that Bela Lugosi himself actually directed part, if not all, of the movie.  Having seen all of the movies made by the Halperin Brothers in the 30's this is deffinitely the best, but DID Bela direct it?  There is a quality in this film lacking from all other Halperin films.  In many scenes the technique seems to have been borrowed from German silent films and Bela did work with Edgar Ulmer in Germany early in his career.  Also notice that WHITE ZOMBIE is essentially a silent film with key scenes performed with a minimum of dialogue . . .or none at all; a standout moment is when Legendre (Bela Lugosi) traps the soul of Madeline (Madge Bellamy) by carving, and then melting, a wax image in her likeness.  All without a single word being said.  Another key sequence is a montage of scenes set against the haunting spiritual \"Listen To The Lambs\" performed by an offscreen chorus.  Notice also the scene where Neil (John Harron, brother of former silent film star Robert Harron) and Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorn) are talking.  The camera starts out behind Harron's back and moves out.  It moves in a circle around the room while the men talk and finally goes back behind Harron to end the scene; deffinitely an Expressionist Germanic touch! Granted the film has its flaws, Joseph Cawthorn's character is supposed to be to be a Christian missionary but he has a noticably Yiddish accent. Also for a film that is set in Haiti there is an uncomfortable lack of black characters.  Clarence Muse as the coach driver is the only one in the movie! Two other alleged native Haitians are white actors in blackface!  Madge Bellamy's bee-stung lips and eye makeup also belong back in a silent film. Weighed against the film as a whole however, these inadequacies are slight. The cast is quite good.  Robert Fraser met up with Lionel Atwill in THE VAMPIRE BAT (1934).  Clarence Muse met up with Bela again in THE INVISIBLE GHOST (1944).  One of the zombies is played by George Burr McAnnan who had played the puritannical leader of the farm community that ostracises unwed mother Lillian Gish in WAY DOWN EAST (1920).  Also look for Brandon Hurst as a creepy looking butler.  He had played the evil Jehan Frollo opposite Lon Chaney's Quasimodo in THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1923). By all means see this movie!  It is well worth your time. So did Bela direct it?  Alas we may never know.  Then again, in an interview given in the early 1970's Clarence Muse said he clearly recalled Bela directing a few scenes.  So maybe . . .", "An early horror movie, which stands as the first ever movie to feature zombies, or at least creatures that can be called zombies. Don't be put off by the typical plot, or the fact that these zombies are not of the modern flesh-eating variety seen in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, rather the old-fashioned mute slaves. WHITE ZOMBIE features some nice (if low budgeted) atmospheric scenes in graveyards, where bodies are ripped from their graves under the cover of the night and used in sinister black magic rituals where they are reanimated and set to work. You see, zombies are the perfect workers; they don't talk, they don't need paying, they don't even have a union!We just know we're back in familiar horror territory when the film opens with two young lovers fleeing into an unknown world (in this case, Haiti) in a carriage, little realising the terrible situations they will find themselves in. Unfortunately a lot of potential impact is ruined when the actors begin acting - and we realise that they're hopelessly trapped in the past, their over-acting carefully built up in the silent movies and unable to let go, only a few years after the silent films had actually ended.At fault the most? Probably the actor playing the couple's host, who permanently has manic hair, gleaming eyes, and a larger-than-life persona. The dashing hero is not in the least bit dashing, instead he keeps on fainting instead of battling the hordes of evil, and it is up to an old man to save the day in the final reel! What a wimp. The actress playing his wife isn't much better, it's difficult to distinguish her transformation from human into zombie seeing as she's just about catatonic for the entire film. Still, her woeful/soulless demeanour is a good one and scenes of her under Legendre's control are genuinely unsettling.Thankfully, though, we have old Bela Lugosi hanging around the sets, giving us an actor to watch and recognise in all this madness. Lugosi was already typecast after making the fantastic Dracula, and it shows here, with maximum emphasis on Lugosi's evil appearance (complete with widow's peak and goatee beard). The film also employs the trick of having Lugosi's staring, wild eyes displayed in close-up, a technique Hammer relied on in their Dracula films with Lee substituted for Lugosi. You can really believe that Legendre is capable of hypnotising people with the smallest effort, and of course, being the baddie he gets all the best lines. The best line in the film is where the hero asks who the zombies are, Lugosi replies \"For you, my friend, they are the Angels of Death!\".Okay, so much of the film is slow and static, but this is to be expected. To break up the dialogue we have some weird shots of zombies at work in the sugar mills, ignoring a fellow worker who collapses into the mill and is ground up in the mechanism. They just keep working, willed on by Legendre's powers, single-minded and single-purposed, with no thought of their own. To accentuate the fact that these people are supposedly dead, some crude black makeup is used to make fingers seem thin and skeletal, also in eye sockets to make the actors look like cadavers. While this might not be frightening to a modern audience, it is effective in a simplistic way.WHITE ZOMBIE is perhaps a little too low key for it's own good, but there is some genuine suspense built up at the finale, where Lugosi clutches his hands together in a battle of wills with the hero and heroine, and the zombies are forced to walk off a cliff after good wins out in the end (and you just knew it would). This exciting climax compliments an atmospheric film which wrings maximum haunting impact from the zombies themselves.", "A couple of years ago I saw the 1931 version of Dracula as part of a live performance for the new musical score composed by Philip Glass. Even in this refined setting, the film was met by laughter from the audience during several sections. This seemed rather odd to me, but I suppose older horror films cannot help but lose some of their initial impact over time. The black and white photography and performance techniques became antiquated, hence humorous to some. As time went on, filmmakers begin to spoof the broad overacting and dramatic music of the vintage horror picture. It is impossible today to view a film like WHITE ZOMBIE and fully understand the impact it may have had in 1932. It does, however, escape (for the most part anyway) the mirthful reactions described above.Director Victor Halprin's telling of this tale is often cited as the genesis of the \"zombie picture.\" There is some debate about this, but WHITE ZOMBIE is certainly one of the early films to deal with the Haitian legend of \"the dead that walk.\" The story revolves around a young couple who have traveled through Haiti to meet with their friend and benefactor Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer), at whose villa they plan to be married. He has designs on the young bride, Madeleine (Madge Bellamy), and enlists the help of Murder Legendre (the name kind of says it all) played by Bela Lugosi. After the wedding, Legendre performs some \"witchcraft\" rituals and Madeleine falls into a death-like state. Believing that she has in fact died, the newly minted groom (John Harron) spirals into a drunken maelstrom, eventually seeking out the learned missionary Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorn) to help solve the mystery. All paths seem to lead back to Legendre as the plot thickens and Beaumont's true motives are discovered.It is fascinating to watch these type of films, some of which, like WHITE ZOMBIE age well with time. This is partly due to the fact that it has been largely forgotten in the wake of the more successful Universal horror flicks. The main drawn here will be the performance by Lugosi. He essentially \"vamps\" his role in Dracula, but manages to fashion a fairly distinct and unsettling screen presence. It would be roles like this however that would lead to his rigid typecasting; as time went on, he was all but discarded by the film industry (see ED WOOD [1994] for his later years). Halprin's direction focuses on atmosphere and gloom. He is well paired with cinematographer Arthur Martinelli and together they create a suitably shadow-laden backdrop for this macabre story. WHITE ZOMBIE is ambitious in camera angles and editing. At one point there is a diagonal wipe edit, which stops midscreen to reveal the actions of two separate characters. This type of effect is effortless to achieve now, but must have been laborious in 1932. Observe also the unusually large transitional set of the plantation interior, or the framing of Lugosi though the ornate stone work during certain shots. These small details help set WHITE ZOMBIE apart by creating a realistic environment and aid in visually representing the pathology of the characters.Since the 30's there has been countless movies about killer zombies run amuck. The concept predominantly became fodder for B-grade schlock productions. The genre would experience something of a renaissance in 1968 with George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD which created quite a stir at the time and resulted in zombies becoming, once again, fashionable. The Haitian setting of WHITE ZOMBIE would also be revisited in THE SERPENT AND THE RAINBOW (1988) and the \"undead\" as a means of cheap labor subtext would be exploited for darkly comedic effect in the underrated HBO film CAST A DEADLY SPELL (1991). In recent years, there has been such a boom of these \"living dead\" productions that it is hard to keep track of them all. WHITE ZOMBIE, as an early example of this current trend, but should be seen as more than just a footnote in the ever growing history of film. It is not a great movie, like Dracula, but will prove to be of interest to film buffs at least. It has more to offer, though, and I hope that it will continue to be rediscovered by successive generations. 7/10", "The picture is set in Haiti and deals upon a wizard called Murder (Bega Lugosi) who wants to abduct a charming girl(Magde Bellamy) from her recent husband by means of Voodoo.

It's the better film directed by Victor Halperin.", "You have to change your way of looking at movies to really enjoy old horror movies like this one. Don't be in a rush to see action, violence and don't expect to see any bloodshed at all. Most of the grisly part is implied and you have to fill in the details. Instead, watch it for the scenery, the acting and the plot.I prefer the older horror films to the newer, slash-fest movies because they allow me to think and they generally have a good, moral theme. You never have a good guy as a demon or a fiend, for instance.White Zombie has the older, traditional zombie characters that are not evil in themselves. Instead, they are mindless and controlled by a shaman, who is generally evil and must be destroyed to set the zombies, who are victims, free. In the newer Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead, the Zombies are either not controlled or are evil themselves and must be destroyed.I think the acting by the zombies is very good and so is their make-up (i.e. they have very frightening faces.) Their master, played by Bela Lugosi, is also played masterfully. The missionary is also good, but most of the rest of the cast is only average.It's a fun movie to watch and I gave it a score of 7 out of 10. If you love early horror movies, buy it. Don't pay more than $10 unless it's packaged with other movies because the picture and the sound quality are weak. If not, you might catch it on a Friday night horror fest on TV. It's worth the time watching it if for Bela Lugosi alone.", "In Haiti, a sweetheart couple from America are stopped from marrying by a desperate plantation owner who wants the girl for himself; he turns for help to the diabolic voodoo master who also runs the sugar cane mill (which is staffed by the living dead!). A zombie Gothic, reportedly the first of its kind; rather ridiculous on the whole, but still retaining some potency and fascination due to the atmospheric production design and cinematography. Solid direction from Victor Halperin (whose brother, Edward, served as producer) lends the scenario a woozy, dream-like feel. Bela Lugosi, looking a bit like Fu Manchu, gives a playful, sassy performance, and his zombie minions are a slow-stepping but spooky lot. There are some sexual proclivities which are steeped in the hypothetical, giving the story some unexpected subtext, as well as a general air of good humor and melodramatic adventure. ** from ****", "Hoping to capitalize on his success in the classic Dracula for Universal, Bela Lugosi stars in White Zombie which draws elements from a whole lot of horror features of the time including Lugosi's own Dracula and The Island Of Dr. Moreau. You will also find pieces of Frankenstein, The Mummy, Svengali, and The Most Dangerous Game here. I daresay if I looked at it again I might find other films that I could compare with.The mix doesn't always work well, but the atmosphere created is great and there's nothing wrong with Bela Lugosi's performance of studied evil. Lugosi is the 'zombie master' and with a concoction of voodoo jungle juice and some hypnotic tricks he's created a race of soulless beings, not alive or dead. He's one practical dude that Bela, he hires his zombies out to the local planters in that area of Haiti. You got to admit this crew works real cheap, better than convict labor.Young lovers John Herron and Madge Bellamy come to the island and their host, planter Robert Frazer decides he has to have Bellamy, devil take the consequences. But it's a devil's game he plays when he makes a deal with Lugosi who turn her into one of his creatures. And Bela's got plans all his own for Bellamy, the kind his Dracula had for Helen Chandler in that film.Playing the Van Helsing role in White Zombie is Joseph Cawthorn who sounds awful Jewish to be a Christian minister. But he does know his way around the island and its voodoo customs.In fact Lugosi and Cawthorn are the only two in the cast not guilty of overacting. The other players are all silent screen veterans who never quite got the technique of sound down. But the show really is all Lugosi's.", "If you've seen a lot of Bela Lugosi's films, you might be tempted to think that apart from the horror movies he made for Universal Studios the rest of his films were crap. This wouldn't be fair but it also could easily be understood due to the huge volume of rotten films he made during his career (such as his movies for Ed Wood). However, dismissing him too quickly is a mistake, as this little film from United Artists is amazingly scary and exciting to watch more than 70 years later due to excellent writing, special effects and acting.The film is a super-moody thriller about zombies in Haiti. However, unlike Val Lewton's super famous I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, this film is much, much scarier and has a much creepier look about it. In particular, I loved the matte painting used for the castle on the cliff--it was highly reminiscent of some of the matte work done for KING KONG the following year. I also liked the look they gave Lugosi--looking more like the Devil than Dracula!! This, combined with his excellent delivery, made this one of his best performances.The film is about an evil man that is secretly in love with a woman he met on a cruise. This woman is about to be married and the evil guy asks her and her fianc\u00e9 to come to his mansion to be married. In the meantime, he meets with Lugosi who informs him that they can fake her death and make her his zombie lover! Then we see the products of Lugosi's mad secret--an army of zombie workers that are used as cheap labor on the sugar cane plantation! They work incessantly and decline to become unionized--a dream come true for an evil capitalist! Once they use the magic formula and do some mumbo-jumbo, the new husband thinks his bride is dead and he spends much of the rest of the film drinking and brooding. The evil guy, though, isn't much happier with her as life with a zombie bride turns out to be pretty lame after all (what a surprise)! But, by now the deed has been done and Lugosi threatens the evil guy when he talks of wanting to restore the lady to her original condition. This is when the film really heats up and leads to a wonderful and super-creepy conclusion! I don't want to ruin it, but this film really delivers and deserves to be recognized as an exceptional film.", "After having enjoyed Bela Lugosi's surprisingly strong 1941 movie Invisible Ghost,I decided to take a look at another Lugosi title from a Mil Creek,which along with later inspiring the name for future writer/director Rob Zombie's Industreal band,is also credited with being the \"first ever\" zombie film.The plot:Arriving in Haiti for their upcoming wedding,fianc\u00e9's Madeline Short and Neil Parker head to plantation owner Charles Beaumont home,so that they can begin preparing the wedding reception.Heading to Beaumont's house,Short and Parker's carriage is stopped in its track's by a gang of locals from fellow plantation owner \"Murder\" Legendre's plant.Nagotiating his way around the gang,the coach driver gives the couple the good news that workers at Legendre's factory are \"Neither living,or dead\".Shaken by what they have seen,Parker and Short attempt to relax when they at last reach Charles Beaumont's house.With being focused on making the wedding as perfect as possible,Parker and Short fail to notice Beaumont developing a deep desire for Short.Desperate to get his hands on Short,Beaumont decides that he is going to do everything possible to turn Parker into one of Legendre's undead workers.View on the film:Saved from being lost forever thanks to a surviving print being discovered in the 60's,the film impressively contains a transfixing atmosphere,which along with still having a real kick after its now 81 years ago origin,is also able to make the \"damaged\" soundtrack something that is easy to forgive.Despite shooting the movie in only 11 days,director Victor Halperin reveals a sharp eye for in- camera special effects,with the scenes of Parker realising about Beaumont's desire for Short having a strong icy chill,and Haperin also including a delightfully black comedy raven,that helps to give the movie a real Gothic edge.Placing Parker and Short's romance at the centre of his adaptation of William's Seabrook's novel The Magic Island,the screenplay by Garnett Weston sadly makes the paternally exciting subtext that the \"upper class\" see all of the workers as slaves/zombies one that is disappointingly underdeveloped,with Weston instead focusing on the romantic side of Short and Parker's relationship,which despite having a charm about it,leaves the film from fully grasping its tantalising plot threads.Along with a wonderfully stern Bela Lugosi,the cute Madge Bellamy, (who also starred in John Ford's overlooked Western The Iron Horse)gives an excellent performance Madeline Short,thanks to Bellamy showing Short go from a rosy cheek youngster,into becoming an undead whiter shade of pale.", "White zombie is recorded as being the first Zombie movie ever mad. They Zombie actors did an amazing job of it, especially when considering they had no bases to work from. It was all about portraying creepy and terrifying through a stiff body poster and facial features. And they pooled it off. It was the \"eyes\" of Lugosi, the king of Zombies who put the fear in me. Amazing skills as an actor to convey so much with just the eyes. The movie is at one scary, mysterious, weird, and funny. The key feature of White zombie is that it was made to scar the people of its time, not ours. And this is probably why most people won't give it the time of day. It is an old movie with old style acting and scare tactics. The viewer has to know that be for watching it.", "Madeline (Madge Bellamy) and Neil (John Harron) travel to Haiti where they are to be wed. Unfortunately for the loved up couple, devious local Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer) has designs on Madeline and gets voodoo witch doctor 'Murder' Legendre (Bela Lugosi) to make it appear as though the young woman has died. In reality, she is under a powerful zombie spell and is brought back from the grave to become Beaumont's obedient love slave.White Zombie, starring Bela Lugosi, is considered an early horror classic by many, who laud the film for its eerie dreamlike atmosphere and expressionist/gothic imagery. I, on the other hand, found it all rather disappointing, the extremely sluggish pace and hammy acting (Lugosi leading the charge, with his evil zombie eyes and silly zombie grip) leaving me distinctly unimpressed.Yes, there are some memorable visuals, most notably Legendre's creaky sugar mill (powered by zombies), his cliff-top fortress and its cavernous reception room, but there are also long stretches where nothing much of interest happens (most of the scenes involving the expressionless Madeline), making it the sort of film likely to put all but the most ardent of Lugosi fans into a catatonic state.3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for IMDb.", "Lugosi is his usual sinister self, evil and Satanic looking, particularly when a medium close-up shot of his eyes fill the screen. The film is stage-bound, yet it has an exotic, sprawling feel to its mansion setting, elaborately decorated. It's also a good example of the then-current transition from silent films to \"talkies\", as there is only sporadic, yet well-written and memorable, dialogue. Chilling image, also, of zombie slave falling silently into huge grinder, and no one notices, or seems to even comprehend what happened.Yet, for all of those things working in its favour, why is this movie so boring? It is slowly paced and draggy, even at only 65 minutes, and by the time the effectively creepy ending happens, I felt like it had gone on for hours. It was further negated by a terrible final line; an attempt at lightening the mood with humour, and it failed miserably.", "I have a list of \"must watch\" movies, and one of the rules is no more than two from any given year.Here's an odd thing. I have yet to find two from 2005 I would put on this list. But I already have two from 1932 and want to put this one on it. One of those is \"Freaks,\" surely one of the most effective movies of all time, not just because of its cinematic power, but the obvious reality that the characters are playing much themselves.The other \"must see\" is currently \"Mask of Fu Manchu,\" something so visually novel it stirs deep. So I cannot put this on my list of what I call \"4's,\" but let me state here that you really must see this.Yes, for me it is better than the early Draculas and Frankensteins. They have power, but through repetition, refinement that surrounds the experience. But essentially they are literary horror. This is the first major, talking horror film (other than \"Freaks\") that is purely envisioned cinematically.It has a sappy ending. And a few of the sets seem unnaturally flat. But its something that weaves the skin.That's because instead of wangling with science and God like Frankenstein, or virgin's blood and what is effectively gypsy magic \u0097 it is directly American in striking at race and sex.The race component is typically American in its presentation. This is black man's magic, but it is performed by a white man, Lugosi in fine form. More than any other monster actor, Lugosi's later projects deepened his presence in the earlier ones. He really is a marvelously spooky guy and I have Ed Wood to thank for the creepiest Lugosi.Its black man's magic, but if you look, all the zombies are white men. The key posse is directly white. Of the many slaves, some are white and others seem like they are whites in blackface, all cast because they have tortured blankness. The very idea of this is offputting.The story is simple: a man on a voyage falls in love, but the target of his affection is already engaged to a feckless fellow. He entices the couple to his Haitian home to be wed. Meanwhile, he arranges from the Lugosi character to turn her into a zombie for his sexual pleasure, a love slave.We know from the very first scene that Lugosi lusts after the same china doll virgin. Our original man gets his prize, a sex slave. But she is soulless, emptyeyed. And he decides sex with her isn't what he imagined, so he goes back to Lugosi to ask that her soul be returned. He would rather have passion as hate than passionless love.That's when Lugosi decides to take the girl for himself. It ends in a silly scuffle.But along the way, there's a cool effect. How Lugosi turns his victims into zombies is by making an image, a detailed carving of the target in candlewax, presumably beeswax.Its a clever idea, one I call folding. We are watching an image on screen, and he wants to turn a real character (who is in turn not real, merely played) into an image of herself. Once the waxen image is perfected, it is melted, destroyed. Then he can control what's left with his stare and interlocked hands.So that we can get the full meaning of the sexual intent, we are shown this doll in the underwear preparing for her wedding with magical sounds out her window. Then she is taken before her virginity is.The scene where her captor decides her languor is intolerable is something. She is playing the piano. It is music written for the movie, but clearly in emulation of Chopin. That composer is known for music that a strong soul can fill with immense passion. Here it really is passionless. Compare this to the usually opposite effect: Johnny Depp playing Chopin with a corpse, Liv Ullman an other wise soulless woman playing, and similarly the empty Jack Nicholson. \"Corpse Bride,\" \"Autumn Sonata\" and \"Five Easy Pieces.\" Ah, the horrible power of talkies.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.", "When they were actually zombies and not flesh-eating ghouls because Romero ripped off Richard Matheson.Anyway, the plot line is that a couple of nice kids go to Haiti to get married, and the owner of a plantation wants the bride for himself. He makes a deal with the local Zombie-maker (Lugosi) to poison her with the zombie drug. But Lugosi has his own agenda (doesn't he always?) Now, this movie was an attempt to cash in on the popularity of Lugosi after the smash hit of Dracula, and they repeat a lot of the creepy atmospherics here. But in many ways, this was a cheaper movie that no one thought anyone would still be watching 80 years later.Lugosi's great limitation as an actor is that he never really mastered English. So you often wondered if he understood what was going on in a scene.The film was probably terrifying to 1930's audiences, who were probably a lot easier to scare.", "This review will be more about the print and theatrical experience than about the plot. Most people won't find this \"useful\", but hey, so what. Here's my two cents.If you have the opportunity to see the Roan Group print projected in a theater, don't hesitate. Go see it.I just saw this in the big screen last weekend and it is MUCH better in a proper theater with a crowd of enthusiasts than in the confines of your home, even with a big TV and 5.1. The audience I was in was comprised of about 150 kids and their parents. The kids had a great time as did I, who has seen the movie several times over the years in the washed out public domain video prints that have circulated forever.The Roan Group print (same as the remastered DVD) is the one we saw, projected in 35 mm. It was obvious that there were two sources for this print. The vast majority of this appears to come from a very nice print with high contrast and sharp definition. The \"fill-in\" portions, apparently missing from the other source, are much more typical of a 75-year-old cheapie independent production shot in 11 days, i.e., scratchy, multiple generations removed from the negative, and faded. Thankfully there's not too much from that second source. There are a few jumps in the film (a few seconds at most) that could not be restored. Too bad, but no biggie.The sound was problematic, veering from a comfortable volume when dialogue was speaking, to way too loud, almost to the point of distortion, when the music played or the bird squawked. I really don't think it was the theater's fault as their sound is always \"just right\".Interestingly, for a movie this old (pre King Kong and Bride of Frankenstein) there was a whole lot of music and not as much dialogue as one usually gets in a film from this era. The music was rarely background to dialogue and was used almost exclusively to enhance the mood of the film. It was probably cheaper to do it this way, but who cares why. It works.This is a really neat film full of great shots and creepy characters. Bela is fantastic, maybe his best performance on film. White Zombie hardly ranks up there with the Universal classics of the era, but it is positively time for a historical and critical reappraisal of this newly restored film.It's good on video, but on the big screen, WOW!", "Arriving in Haiti, Madeline and Neil (Madge Bellamy and John Harron) were to be married right away, but were delayed by the strange Mr. Beaumont (Robert Frazer), who has become unnaturally obsessed with Madeline. Unaware of Beaumont's nefarious motives, the young couple stays at his palatial home.Beaumont seeks out the mysterious Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi) at his sugar mill, operated by a small army of \"men\", looking not-quite-alive. Legendre's unique abilities could help Beaumont with his desire to possess Madeline. Of course, Legendre has plans of his own for everyone involved! Death and unholy resurrection ensue. Can Neil and his friend, Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorn) somehow stop Legendre, and reverse his abominable act?WHITE ZOMBIE is a fantastic, early film about evil men, their wicked plots, and the living dead. Lugosi imbues his role with seething malice, looking about as satanic as is humanly possible! His eyes and those grasping hand gestures are truly memorable.EXTRA POINTS FOR: Legendre's shadowy, labyrinthine castle! Annnd, that damnable vulture! It's screeching could curdle mercury! Highly recommended for the horror fanatic, especially the zombie enthusiast...", "This is a horror classic.

Incredible otherworldly atmosphere and the eerie, haunting Lugosi  insures a high quality black and white thriller.", "The ULTIMATE ZOMBIE flick? Actually I would think NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD or one of it's sequels was that. WHITE ZOMBIE is an intelligent movie dealing with the world of the zombies - but it actually is considerably more than that.Bela Lugosi's career in Hollywood did not begin with a flourish in Dracula. He had been in films (including silent movies) in a wide variety of parts in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He appears in several film comedies like FIFTY MILLION FRENCHMEN and WOMEN OF ALL NATIONS (one of the Edmund Lowe - Victor McGlaglan \"Quirt & Flagg\" spin-offs). He was also in Warner Baxter's SUCH MEN ARE DANGEROUS as a doctor. But it was the role of the Count that made forever a Hollywood star and symbol. He rejected the follow - up part of Frankenstein's monster, allowing Boris Karloff to get that role. But shortly after he was offered the role of voodoo expert and zombie master \"Murder Legrande\" in WHITE ZOMBIE.The story is simple. Robert Frazer is Beaumont a wealthy man who has met Madge Bellamy (Madeleine Short) on a sea voyage to his native home. She is going there to meet her fianc\u00e9 John Harron (Neil Parker) to marry him. Beaumont falls heavily in love with her, and decides he must have her by any means. He meets Parker and suggests the wedding be held on his country estate.They ride out at night, and are twice surprised unpleasantly. First by some of the natives burying a recently deceased person in a road they are using (the reason is that the locals don't want the dead person revived for zombie work, and figure it is less easy to dig up the corpse if the person is in a constantly used road). Secondly, they meet a man (it turns out to be Legrande) who is working in his fields with some assistance. Legrande falls for Short, and snatches her scarf. The coach driver (Clarence Muse) sees the men are zombies and drives the coach off.At Beaumont's home, Parker and Short meet Joseph Cawthorne (Dr. Bruner) who is to perform the wedding. Bruner is a little surprised at his invitation to do this from Beaumont, whom he barely knows. They also meet Beaumont's servant Brandon Hurst (Silver, the butler), who is aware of Beaumont's personal schemes and tries to dissuade him from going to get the assistance of Legrande. While the young couple and the Reverend refresh themselves, Beaumont is picked up in a carriage (which he is amazed is driven by one of the zombies). He goes to Legrande's mill (where all the work is done by field zombies - one of whom falls into the mill's grinding machine without a sound, and with nobody else except Beaumont taking notice). Legrande and Beaumont discuss the problem of the up-coming marriage, and how Beaumont wants to prevent it. Actually by this time so does Legrande, but for his own reasons. However, it is obvious that the besotted Beaumont is less realistic than the \"worldlier\" Legrande. Beaumont is given a potion to use to turn Short into a zombie. A drop of the potion is enough.Beaumont tries to talk Short out of it, but she won't be talked. So, reluctantly, he has Silver doctor a rose to give to Short, who takes it. The wedding goes well, but during the party afterward Short is affected by the drug and collapses and \"dies\". Subsequently she is dug up and turned over to Beaumont as his zombie sex slave.That is the first half of the movie, and I won't go into anything further. But what is frequently missed is that it is more than a study (and a good one) on zombies. Legrande is also a voodoo master, able to summon vultures to do his bidding, as well practicing voodoo arts. Twice we see him carving and manipulating wax figures, first of Short, later of Beaumont, to torment or to manipulate the people to behave in a certain way. With Beaumont, Legrande actually toys (in a very memorable moment - Lugosi was obviously enjoying it) with the doomed fool by carving the \"Beaumont doll\" with a sharp knife while the stricken man watches helplessly. Also note the scene between Cawthorne and Harron, where Cawthorne demonstrates a great knowledge of the odd laws of Haiti, which included laws concerning creating zombies.The film is also set in Haiti, and has that tragic country's poverty and traditions down pat. Most of the people are villagers in dirt farms or such. Beaumont and Legrande have large estates, but they are isolated (we see Short preparing for her wedding and hearing drums beating to drive away evil spirits - she orders her window doors shut and the noises are cut out). Legrande's home is on a high cliff facing the sea. It reminds us of King Henri Christophe's mighty fortress palace (still in existence today) that was the greatest engineering feat of the first third of the 19th Century.The acting honors belong to Bela and Cawthorne, who enlivens every scene he is in with his honesty and friendliness. Lugosi has, in Legrande, the closest clone to his Count Dracula he'd ever get. There are many similarities between the films, both starting with carriage trips at night, amidst unnerving events, and both involving \"undead\" victims. Legrande, however, is more of a businessman (he even suggests that Beaumont might find the zombies useful for his enterprises). As the lovers, Bellamy is adequate, but her acting gets limited to the difficulty of looking blank for much of the film, while under the zombie-inducing drugs. Harron has a good moment when, thinking his recently wed wife dead, he gets drunk and sees her face constantly in front of him. As the doomed butler, Hurst does a capable job. The zombies are quite unsettling when you see them - especially the tall bearded one.", "One of the most important names in the history of the horror genre is without a doubt, Bela Lugosi, the Hungarian actor who in 1931 became an icon after playing the legendary Count Dracula in Tod Browning's adaptation of the film. Thanks to the powerful presence he gave to the elegant vampire, Lugosi became instantly famous and a major star for Universal Studios. Sadly, due to his heavy accent Lugosi wouldn't have much luck in finding roles for him, and eventually became type-casted as the obvious choice for playing sinister and classy villains in horror films, a problem that would take him from making movies for big studios to acting in low-budget independent films. However, the fact that such movies weren't big productions didn't mean that they were bad films, and this 1932 film is probably the best proof of that, as \"White Zombie\" is a classic as important as any film done by Universal in those years.In \"White Zombie\", Neil Parker (John Harron) and his fiance\u00e9 Madeline (Madge Bellamy) are traveling to a plantation located in Haiti to celebrate their wedding. Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer), the owner of the plantation, invited the couple to his house after meeting them on a cruise ship during one of his travels, and not only he offered his plantation for the party, he has also offered Neil a highly profitable job in the island. However, there is a sinister purpose behind Beaumont's apparent good nature and friendly attitude: he is madly in love with Madeleine and plans to separate the couple before the wedding. To do this, he has asked the help of a man named Legendre (Bela Lugosi), a Voodoo sorcerer with the ability to create and control zombie slaves. But the zombie master has his own plans for the trio's souls.Written by Garnett Weston, \"White Zombie\" is a very dark and atmospheric tale of horror and suspense partially inspired by the writings of traveler W.B. Seabrook, whose 1929 book, \"The Magic Island\", introduced Voodoo to American audiences. Of course, Weston's movie is a highly fictionalized account of Voodoo, but it was probably the first movie to introduce zombies to the horror genre. With a story that mixes romance, horror and melodrama, \"White Zombie\" is essentially a Faustian tragedy with a Voodoo setting, where a man's forbidden desire brings damnation to him and those around him. There is not really a lot of character development through the film, but that actually helps as \"White Zombie\" is more about the nightmarish experience of the three characters facing Legendre's sinister machinations than about their relationships.The film's highlight is certainly Victor Halperin's directing, which in its cinematography (by Arthur Martinelli) shows a lot of influence from the German expressionist movement of the 20s and gives the movie an ominous surreal atmosphere. Due to the film's scarce use of dialogs, it would be easy to believe that Halperin wasn't interested in sound technology (new at the time), however, he does give an interesting use to sound in this film by using atmospheric sounds and Xavier Cugat's score to enhance the film's eerie ambiance. It is clear that Halperin was working on a very low-budget (sets were rented from Universal Studios), but his inventive use of camera effects together with Martinelli's beautiful cinematography truly give the film a special nightmarish look similar to Browning's \"Dracula\" or Dreyer's \"Vampyr - Der Traum Des Allan Grey\".The acting is for the most part effective, although several members of the main cast give average performances that tend to diminish the power of the film a bit. John Harron is one of them, delivering a really weak performance as Neil, a shame as his character is essentially the story's protagonist. Robetr Frazer is a bit better as Charles Beaumont, although like Harron, he could had done a better job than the average performance he gave. Still, Madge Bellamy is remarkable as Madeleine, and is specially dreamy after falling under Legendre's spell. Now, if Bellamy is excellent in her role, Bela Lugosi is simply perfect as the macabre zombie master Legendre. Taking what he did in \"Dracula\" one step beyond, Lugosi appears here in what is probably one of the best performances of his career, literally becoming this embodiment of evil with his strong presence and sinister elegance.Like the previously mentioned film \"Vampyr\", Victor Halperin's \"White Zombie\" seems to be a literal bridge between silent films and the sound era, as it keeps a lot of the silent style of film-making including the highly expressive acting and the expressionist visual design. Together with the movie's extremely slow pace, those elements enhance the whole surrealist vibe that surrounds the movie, making it look almost as the representation of a nightmare. However, this is a double edged sword, as certainly those elements may disappoint those expecting something more graphic and action-packed (it is nothing like the modern zombie films of Romero and Fulci), or at least, something similar to Universal's \"Frankenstein\"'s series. Don't get me wrong, this is still Gothic horror at its best, but it's definitely on a more serious tone than most Universal films.\"White Zombie\" is a difficult film to watch, but certainly one that's very rewarding in the end. Its silent style feels definitely dated, but oddly, this only adds to that surreal atmosphere that Halperin was aiming for when making the film. Sadly, director Victor Halperin would never reach the mastery of this work, as if this was the movie he was destined to make. A very underrated classic of horror, \"White Zombie\" is another of the films that prove that there was more in Bela Lugosi than \"Dracula\", and it's a film that can proudly stand next to the Universal classics despite its modest and humble origins. 8/10"], "tt0023874": [], "tt0024055": ["Boris Karloff plays a crazy old guy who worships the Egyptian god, Anubis. On his death bed, he swears that if anyone should steal a sacred jewel from his Anubis statue he will return from the dead to exact revenge. Not surprisingly, several very greedy people come along and try stealing the jewel--only to incur the wrath of the zombie Karloff. Despite the whole Egyptian aspect of the film, though, he was not a mummy nor was this just a rehash of THE MUMMY (also from 1933). Overall, it's a rather standard but well-produced zombie murdering the idiots film--not great, but certainly worth seeing.By the way, in a funny inside joke, there is a parody of the \"desert savage\" style of film. THE SHEIK, THE SON OF THE SKEIK and THE BARBARIAN were among several films like this and in THE GHOUL, there is a supposed sheik and a lady who is infatuated with this clich\u00e9d image of a macho and sexist Middle Eastern lover.", "I just watched this jaw-droppingly pristine copy of \"The Ghoul\" available on MGM DVD, which is a transfer of a recently discovered practically unused and complete print of the film found at the British Film Institute. The image is unbelievably clear and the sound has been processed (by the engineers at Sonic Solutions) so that it is quite comparable to recordings made at least 30 years later and possibly even better since it is engineered to fill up both channels of a stereo set-up (with no background hiss or grating of any kind). The original music by Louis Levy (aided by Leighton Lucas) is innovative and prescient for the time.The photography and art direction - by two German expressionists of renown, including The Archers' legendary Alfred Junge - are stupendous, especially the London fog scenes and the great details of the interior scenes. I was also pleasantly surprised by the mobility of the camera at all times and the realistic aspect of the action scenes. The atmosphere is suspenseful and chillingly mysterious and all the actors are extremely good (and famous!), including the two \"young adorables\" acting as principals, shapely Dorothy Hyson and stalwart Anthony Bushell.The dialog is at least twice as witty as that found in the Universal horror flicks of the same era and the story actually makes sense, although, unfortunately, it is of the \"Scooby-Doo\" school of old dark house mysteries where everything is neatly tied up with a rational explanation at the end, leaving absolutely no room for belief in the supernatural. But this doesn't distract from the extreme intelligence of the whole, the great fun of watching all those clever actors turning in memorable performances and the extra bonus of watching a relative unknown one (Kathleen Harrison in an amorous Carol Burnett-type of persona) stealing the show from everyone else at the end.This film has a little bit of everything for everybody but it should be prized at least for having been saved from total disappearance and as a precious time-travel piece that actually shows the viewer what a brand-new horror film looked like on its first day of projection back in 1933. I enjoyed Ralph Richardson (as a country pastor) in every frame he's in and I am still in awe of Cedric Hardwicke's interpretation of an enigmatic solicitor which so closely resembles an impersonation of \"Mr. Rat\" from \"The Wind in the Willows\". Karloff is underemployed but effective as usual as Professor Morlant (which sounds like \"slow death\" - mort lente - in French) but Ernest Thesiger is priceless as a slow-witted butler with a club-foot and a Scottish brogue.This film has very high entertainment and repeat value for the discriminating viewer and the DVD is being sold for practically no money. After surviving 70 years on the shelf, \"The Ghoul\" has become a must-have instant classic.", "The surprising thing about THE GHOUL is that it features an impressive background score for a film made in '33, when most soundtracks were almost completely devoid of music. This is something the other comments here failed to mention.The other plus factor is the brilliant B&W photography done in Gothic style to suit the story elements here. An Egyptologist returns from the grave to take revenge on a servant who has stolen a sacred jewel. BORIS KARLOFF is the doctor with his own rules about how to offer sacrifices to Anubis in order to have eternal life.The pace is slow and there's too much silly banter that features KATHLEEN HARRISON in a role designed to give the audience comedy relief. RALPH RICHARDSON is excellent as a cleric who seems to be a helpful visitor and ERNEST THESIGER is fine as the nervous servant.The Gothic ambiance is strong with handsome interiors of a house in shadows and the flavor of an \"old dark house mystery\" is well sustained. Plotwise, there are loopholes and the story only really picks up once Karloff has returned from the grave.For fans of this genre, this is an interesting film and Karloff's performance is first rate.", "If you can locate a copy of this exceptional talkie you are indeed fortunate.  It took me years to find, yet it was well worth the wait.The history of this Karloff gem is fascinating.  'The Ghoul' had completely disappeared, not even the trailer survived.  Yet in the 1980's (if I remember correctly), a lone nitrate print turned up in Prague, (with Hungarian subtitles) in *appalling* condition.  Apparently, the nitrate film had shrunk to a mere third of it's original width, was exceptionally brittle and in a number of pieces yet was effectively restored... albeit not to the quality of it's release.  Therefore, I was prepared to overlook the graininess, variable contrast and sound-track distortions.'The Ghoul' belongs to Karloff.  Had the film not vanished it would have become a hardy perennial of late night television horror alongside the Lemalle classics.  As for the cast, sets and script (in that order), the film is superior to other horror classics of the period.The story-line is vaguely reminiscent... an eccentric, terminally ill man (of Egyptian ancestry) decrees that a rare artefact must be entombed with him otherwise trouble will befall.  As to be anticipated, the scarab jewel is removed from the hand of his corpse by a tomb robber not long after internment providing the impetus to wreak revenge in the signature fashion.The quality of the film may distract some viewers, but the atmosphere retains most of it's inaugural impact.  Definitely an eight and a half!", "I disagree wholeheartedly with those who have given this film a bad review. The acting is superb, particularly Ralph Richardson as the 'Vicar', and the character actors, and of course Boris himself. Beautifully shot with wonderful props and set (I'd love to know which house they used!) it could put many a famous cinematic Haunted House to shame! The plot is reasonably clever and well-paced --nobody wants anything too complex in this atmospheric genre-- and the romantic subplot is suitably unsentimental and unobtrusive. Especially wonderful is the moment when the second woman, who had been swooning ridiculously in front of the man who calls himself a Sheik and generally acting silly, turns suddenly brave and holds the baddies at bay with the words (remember this is 1933!) \"I don't THINK so!\"", "Most of the other commenters seem to have seen a truncated, blurry version of this movie.  The new DVD certainly kept me entertained!  It's true that the movie is very dark, but the shadowy photography is beautiful and Germanic -- prime '30s look, fog, candlelight, and all. I just checked, and I see that cinematographer Gunther Krampf also shot NOSFERATU, THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE, and PANDORA'S BOX.  Pretty good resume!Hoaky old dark house cliches and humor, for sure, but funny if you know the genre.  The woman who wants to be the \"sheikh's\" love slave is a real hoot. Karloff, Thesiger, Hardwick, and Richardson are all very good, as are the romantic couple who spar and then decide they like each other (surprise!). Karloff's self-mutilation scene is brilliantly disturbing.  And wait a second, is that a patch of bamboo he stumbles into just in front of the Yorkshire moors?  This is all great fun, perhaps best if you check any high expectations at the door.", "Professor Morlant (Boris Karloff) is near death. He orders his servant Laing (Ernest Thesiger) to bury him with the Eternal Light--a jewel that will bring him immortality. However, after his funeral, the jewel is stolen and there are seven minor characters who just end up in his house that night. Then Karloff comes to life (somehow) and sets off to find who stole his jewel.This was considered a lost film for many years until a full print was discovered in Britain a few years ago. It was made available on DVD by MGM and the transfer is a beauty--crisp clear picture and good sound. Too bad the picture isn't that good.There are far too many needless characters cluttering up the movie and not one is given a full characterization. Also their acting is atrocious--Ralph Morland (Anthony Bushell) screams every line; Ms. Kaney (Kathleen Harrison) is shrill and whiny and they throw in a pastor (Ralph Richardson in his first role) for no good reason! The script is full of terrible lines and horribly bad \"comedy\".DEFINITE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! Also the plot ceases to make sense a few times: how does Karloff come to life again? It's hastily said that he wasn't really dead--just in a trance but that doesn't wash. How is he able to walk around? He was bedridden before death. Why is his face so disfigured? Why can't he speak? Where does this superhuman strength come from (he's able to bend steel bars)? And how about Richardson at the end. Why was he in the crypt? How did he get inside a statue? As you can see, there are far too many unexplained aspects of the story. SPOILERS END!!!!!!!!!!!!!Still it DOES have a few virtues.It is atmospheric and the sets themselves are beautiful. Also Karloff's resurrection is a highlight and he's downright frightening going after people--an excellent makeup job was done on him. Also Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Richardson and Thesiger give good performances. Karloff though is brilliant--he can't speak after he's resurrected and his pantomiming skills (undoubtedly learned from his Frankenstein role) are incredible. But he only comes alive during the closing 30 minutes. Before that there's a good 50 minutes of bad dialogue, plotting and acting to contend with. Still, for a horror fan, it's worth catching once just for the closing 30 minutes. But I can honestly only give this a 5.", "Boris Karloff was already a horror mainstay at this point in his career, having played Frankenstein's monster, The Mummy, and Fu Manchu, and now playing the titular Ghoul. This film has a deceased Karloff coming back to life after an Egyptian jewel he was buried with is stolen. The film really does, pun intended, come to life after Karloff's resurrection, but the build up to that point for the film's short 79-minute runtime is a bit of a slog. Overall, this British horror film isn't exactly a Universal Pictures Horror classic, but it is solid entertainment. FUN FACT! \"The Ghoul\" is one of many films to have fallen into the public domain, so it is freely available for download on the internet.", "On this site there is a criticism which says to stay away from this film because it is incomprehensible. That's correct for the incomplete copies heretofore available. Now MGM Video has released a complete version on VHS and DVD, a very high quality print. The story is very clear now, and this is one of the high end Karloff flicks. If you like vintage horror films, if you're a Karloff fan, if you liked Karloff's \"The Mummy,\" you will like this film.", "This spooky early outing for Karloff has a number of good qualities and also lesser qualities to distinguish it from other offerings. For a start, the film retains a haunting atmosphere which peaks at the scenes where Karloff rises from his tomb. However, it is let down by a slow pace which only picks up towards the end of the film. Sadly, the film quality has deteriorated over the years, and therefore 'jumps' regularly, and also crackles a lot which ruins the appeal of it somewhat and also dates it. A lot of the scenes are in the dark which makes things difficult to see.The plot is the classic 'group of people congregate in house and are attacked by killer' story which has been the basis of other classics like THE CAT AND THE CANARY and THE OLD DARK HOUSE. The cast is good all round. Boris Karloff was following in the horrific footsteps of his classic FRANKENSTEINand once again wore makeup for the monster role, and very effective decayed makeup it is too. Ernest Thesiger is his usual repulsive self as the selfish servant, and the two are given good support from a variety of British actors including Cedric Hardwicke. Ralph Richardson also turns up in an early role. A ghostly drumbeat helps to keep things moving along in this atmospheric tale, and the only thing which ruins it is the bad quality of the film stock. If you can get past this aspect though, then you will find yourself enjoying this classic creaky chiller.", "SPOILERS A lack of a compelling story and a resolution that relies on too many coincidences are the only things that keep \"The Ghoul\" from being an unsung classic. I've read that for years it was relatively obscure, and that might have added to its mystique in the past. Now that it's been rediscovered and released on a pristine-looking DVD (courtesy of MGM), one can finally see it uncut and as it was intended.Karloff is excellent as Professor Morlant, who is quite a fan of Egyptian culture. He keeps a statue of Anubis in his house, and spends his entire fortune on a jewel that, legend has it, will enable him to return from the dead. Unfortunately, his untrustworthy servant Laing (played by the same actor who played Dr. Pretorius in \"Bride of Frankenstein\") gets greedy at the end. Instead of burying Morlant with the jewel bandaged to his hand, he hides the jewel in a tin of coffee. A group of disparate individuals gather at Morlant's estate after his burial, and soon everyone is looking for the jewel. Meanwhile, Morlant rises from the tomb and seeks out those who would stand in the way of eternal life.The thing that will forever remain with me about this film is the brilliant way the story was set up. The sets are breathtakingly morbid, a first-rate haunted house production if ever there was one. Even the scenes that are supposed to be taking place outdoors take place at night and in dense fog, as if the sun never shines on these characters. Karloff looks bizarre right from the beginning, as Morlant lies on his deathbed and tries to ensure that his instructions for his burial are carried out to the letter. The makeup on him is very creepy, and even his fingers look inhuman.The trouble comes with the creaky middle section, in which the characters are rounded up and summoned to Morlant's dusty mansion. The motivations of everybody involved are fanciful, and on hand are two actresses who will give you a headache before the film is over. Dorothy Hyson delivers her lines at a monotonously high volume, as if she's deliberately speaking in falsetto. Kathleen Harrison seems to have been directed to act like a shrieking annoyance. Anthony Bushell is too much of a milquetoast to be an effective hero.The goods come from Karloff, and his first appearance back from the dead is quite chilling. The camera gives him some great closeups in the ghoul makeup, and the director makes classic use of shadows and lighting. There's a great scene where Karloff sneaks up on Harrison and looms over her while she is unaware of him standing right behind her; one especially creepy shot shows him approaching her from behind while we watch through a window.The resolution is silly, if not downright ludicrous. I won't reveal it here, but I will mention that someone comes along and gives an explanation that Morlant was buried alive and is not really a ghoul after all. This seems to contradict a few other details in the story, especially the scene where Morlant looms outside of a barred window, then pries the bars apart with his bare hands to gain entrance to the mansion.Highly recommended for fans of black & white horror films. While the shortcomings of \"The Ghoul\" are glaringly apparent, they are also easily overlooked when you take into consideration the fine visual craft of the film. Excellent for some lights-out Halloween fun.", "The Ghoul in my view is not without imperfections, the pacing in the middle is rather slow and Kathleen Harrison has a tendency to overact. But what we have is a very effective and atmospheric film, and I am glad that it is getting more attention than it did and that others liked it. The sets still look beautiful, while the photography is marvellous and the costumes and make-up(especially for Karloff, very eerie) effective. And it all looks gloriously pristine on DVD. The music is similarly wonderful, incredibly haunting and almost Wagnerian in orchestration, at the same time though it didn't overbear the atmosphere in any way which is a good thing. The dialogue is intelligent with some nice subtle humour, while the story maintains its macabre atmosphere until the very end with a hugely compelling last half-hour. The acting was good, Ralph Richardson gives a very promising first screen appearance while Cedric Hardwicke and Ernest Thesiger give fine performances that are in perfect keeping with the film and the genre. Best of all is Boris Karloff, whose commandingly eerie presence makes for a brilliant performance.To conclude, The Ghoul does deserve more attention I feel as while it is not a perfect film it is a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox", "This old horror/thriller has garnered some enthusiastic reviews. I suppose might won't be so enthusiastic. It struck me as about average. The story about an Ancient Egyptian jewel that can bring life back to the dead isn't particularly interesting, though it's complicated. None of the performances stand out.The dialog has a few pretty good zingers though, and the atmosphere -- old dark house, candle light, stone tomb in the back yard -- is convincing and deliciously photographed.Too bad it's not better than it is. I mean, Ralph Richardson, Boris Karloff, Cedrick Hardwicke. A shame their roles are made of cardboard. The blond is cute. Nobody is a ghoul.", "T. Hayes Hunter's \"The Ghoul\" of 1933 is certainly not one of the best movies starring the incomparable Boris Karloff, as Karloff sadly doesn't have the screen time one could have hoped for, but it has its qualities and is doubtlessly worth watching, also for the reason that \"The Ghoul\" was thought of as a lost film for a long time.Professor Morlant (Boris Karloff), a dying Egyptologist who believes in ancient Egyptian Gods, gives the instructions for his burial to his butler (Ernest Thesinger). Hoping to gain eternal life as a follower of an Egyptian deity, Morlant wants to be buried in a tomb by his mansion, with a statue of his God and a valuable jewel in his hand...This movie's biggest flaw is the lack of screen time for Karloff, out of the movie's 80 minutes, Karloff appears for 25 minutes at the most. In other respects, the movie has many qualities, it is very well photographed, the score is great and fits in perfectly, and all that, as well as lots of shadows, make the movie highly atmospheric and obscure, as the film maintains a certain darkness throughout its entire 80 minutes. Karloff is great as always, and, in spite of the fact that he should have had more screen time, this brilliant actor is so eerie and remarkable that he carries the movie. Seeing Ernest Thesinger (Dr. Pretorius in \"Bride Of Frankenstein\") deliver a great performance as the butler is another great quality of \"The Ghoul\". The performances are generally good, Cedrick Hardwicke is great as the lawyer Broughton, and Kathleen Harrison and Harold Huth are great fun to watch in the film's more humorous parts. Unfortunately, the movie, which starts out greatly, gets quite boring in the middle, and nothing really happens for quite some time. Apart from the unnecessary boredom in the middle of the movie, and the fact that Karloff's role could have been a lot bigger, the movie is certainly worth watching. When it comes to Egyptian themed movies with Karloff, however, I'll recommend \"The Mummy\" of 1932, a true masterpiece, ten times over \"The Ghoul\".All things considered, \"The Ghoul\" is certainly no highlight in the great Boris Karloff's career, but warmly recommended to my fellow fans of classic Horror cinema. 6/10", "Pagan Professor Morlant(Boris Karloff, absent for far too long) wishes for a rare jewel, sold to him by Arab \"shiek\" Aga Ben Dragore(Harold Huth)who stole it from an Egyptian crypt, to be buried in his tomb when he passes. Morlant is dying and has his aide, Laing(Ernest Thesiger, up to his usual scene-stealing ways)bandage the jewel in his hand. Unfortunately for Morlant, Laing steals the jewel in a moment of weakness and before long others seek after it such as Dragore, sneaky no-good accountant Broughton(Cedric Hardwicke), and even \"padre\" Nigel Hartley(Ralph Richardson). Betty Harlon(Dorothy Hyston)and Ralph Morlant(Anthony Bushell)are cousins from bickering families related to Professor Morlant who stood to benefit from anything left by him after his death. What no one counted on was Professor Morlant's \"rising from the grave\" in search of the stolen jewel..he plans to bow at the altar of his pagan statue hoping for eternal life with the jewel clasped in his hand.While being deliciously atmospheric with foggy nights and creepy Morlant estate as the setting, this film lumbers along at too slow a pace. Kathleen Harrison is the comic relief as Kaney, Betty's friend who tags along, falling for Dragore and getting into possible peril when the jewel winds up in her hands out of all people. The leads, Hyson and Bushell aren't charismatic or charming enough, but pros Karloff(..the precious few minutes we have him), Hardwicke, Thesiger, & especially Richardson give this some merit. Not really that bad, but could've been so much better.(added 10/22/11):I have to say that this film has grown on me over time as I thoroughly enjoy the dark, moody photography (the film seems to occur almost entirely at night, giving the picture a proper foreboding as anyone might be hiding somewhere in the darkness prepared to steal the desired jewel)and supporting cast. Like chatty Richardson, who is highly opinionated for someone who shouldn't even be on the premises to begin with, and grumpy, rude Hardwicke who resembled a gargoyle to me. Yes, the plot is slow, but I think it gives the film an appropriate time to set up the variety of characters out to line their pockets if the jewel is attained. And Karloff is at his creepy best, his eyes full of menace, angered at the thievery of his precious jewel. One more thing I thought was fun is the \"rivalry\" between pagan and Christian ideals as Karloff's egyptologist firmly believes in the power of his god, while Richardson challenges such \"immorality\". Speaking of Richardson, he definitely in my mind steals the film as a shady priest who, from practically the moment he appears, seems untrustworthy.", "I believe that this film helps set the pattern for most of not all of the \"classic\" horror films of the 1930s/40s/50s, or at least Karloff's films and those of his imitators. It is best appreciated when viewed in context, and was likely even a bit radical for its day.Very effective use of light and shadow, which is particularly noticeable in the outdoor night scenes, and some interesting angle and closeup work here and there. Good orchestration (not overblown as in later films of this genre). There's even some genuine acting in this film, although some of it is somewhat contrived -- but this is a horror flick, after all. There's also some bits of humorous byplay which are actually fairly subtle for a film of this type and era.Karloff's makeup job isn't bad, either.All things considered, I found it quite interesting and even entertaining. I'm giving it a 9.", "THE GHOUL is one of those films that are rediscovered after being missing for years, and turn out to be worthwhile (something of a rarity). It has a first rate cast of character actors (including two future knights) and a good \"nest of vipers\" plot. And I find it pleasant for bringing in a favorite topic to me: Egyptian archeology and artifacts.Boris Karloff is a dying Egyptologist, who tells his butler Theisinger to make sure a valuable talisman is buried with him. It seems this talisman may guarantee Karloff eternal life according to the ancient Egyptian creed he has come to believe in. Karloff dies, and Theisinger steals the talisman to sell it for a small fortune. But he is soon being pursued by someone - he doesn't know whom. Also he has approached Cedric Hardwicke (looking a bit like a Dickensian figure in a egg shaped bald wig and thick glasses) and Hardwicke is just not the type one can trust.Others soon are interested in the talisman, and willing to kill for it. It drags in Anthony Bushell and his girlfriend, and a would-be vamp seeking her \"Sheikh-like\" mate among the other men in the story. It also brings in Ralph Richardson, as a clergyman who gets involved (and seemingly disgusted) at the greedy goings-on he sees.Richardson was at an interesting point in the 1930s. Occasionally he played good guys (like Robert Donat's ill-fated friend in THE CITADEL), but he usually played villains like in BULLDOG JACK or THE SHAPE TO COME or even in THE MAN WHO COULD PERFORM MIRACLES. His Vicar is an interesting character, who really fools us for most of the movie (and participates in one of the most hair-raising effects in it).Because the talisman should be buried with the deceased, but is stolen and sought by all the villains for their own purposes, the title of the film really should have been \"THE GHOULS\", because ghouls were grave robbers. Instead, the public who saw the film see Karloff resurrected and chasing after the stolen item that is needed for his final eternal rest - and thought that Boris is the titled monster. He is a danger to the other characters, but most of them deserve it.His final act of faith is a grim, and visible one. When it is over one hopes his character did achieve eternal peace.How realistic is this view of Egyptological eccentrics, and the theft of antiquities? Well, read the papers these days, and see how so many museums in the U.S.(including the Metropolitan and the Getty) are returning stolen antiquities to Italy, Egypt, Latin America. The market for such thefts is still there - just look at how they have tried to save the Iraqi museums of valuable Sumerian, Assyrian, and Babylonian tablets and statuary. As for the picture of an Egyptologist going so far off the road as to worship Amon or Ra or Thoth or whoever, if one looks at the initial archaeologists and specialist in Egypt, one finds many eccentrics. Some have weird backgrounds.The fabled Egyptian antiquities collection at the Brooklyn Museum was collected in the late 19th Century by Charles Wilbour, who spent the last thirty years of his life living on a houseboat on the Nile collecting. Wilbour had an interesting life before 1871. He had been the translator of the novels of Victor Hugo into English. He also ran a prosperous printing business in Brooklyn and New York City. It was that, you may say, that led to his relocating in Egypt. Wilbour made a fortune working hand in glove with Boss William Magear Tweed and Tammany Hall in inflating the cost of paper sales to the city of New York. He decided to leave when the Boss fell from power. New York's loss turned out to be the Brooklyn Museum's gain.", "After Boris Karloff starred in The Mummy, he went back to England to film this eerie followup. In this film, he looks like a combination Frankenstein monster and the mummy I'm-Ho-Tep - and as grotesque as possible.The tomb-robbing Ernest Thesiger gets the action going. Karloff stalking through the moldy mansion is as eerie as you can imagine. The end in which Karloff goes back to his tomb has some scenes that are the most hair-raising as you can imagine.NOTE: Avoid copies that are incomplete or cut. The version that I have is 76 minutes long and some of the others seem to be abridged.Watch it with your B-movie buddies.", "This movie is an entertaining tale of Prof. Morlant (Boris Karloff), an eccentric Egyptologist who is fixated on the powers of the ancient Egyptian gods. On his deathbed he tells his servant (Ernest Thesinger) to bind the sacred jewel called \"The Eternal Light\" to his hand.  He warns that if the jewel is taken, he will return from the grave seeking revenge....Boris Karloff's presence and a superb cast move this moody, atmospheric classic along at a great pace.  This movie has some great dialogue and an interesting plot.  It is very rare, but I was lucky enough to find it on video.  If you are a fan of the genre, and you happen to find it, I encourage you to rent it, buy it, whatever.", "Taking a look at the website of DVD company Network,I spotted a Boris Karloff title featuring a commentary from Stephen Jones & Kin Newman,which led to me getting ready to uncover the ghoul.View on the film:For the first ever (sound) British Horror film, (labelled \"Horrific\" when it first came out)director T. Hayes Hunter & cinematographer G\u00fcnther Krampf soak the title in a haunting Gothic Horror atmosphere,with Hunter and Krampf using low lights to give the creeks bursting from Morlant's country house a real crunch.Along with the creeping Gothic chills,Hunter also reveals a keen eye for stylish set pieces,as Morlant's mansion is revealed to contain a straight from Egypt tomb,and a fiery pit,which leads to Hunter delivering an explosive final.Whilst Hunter sets the mood for his adaptation of Leonard Hines and Frank King's play,the screenplay by Rupert Downing/Roland Pertwee & John Hastings Turner struggles to give Hunters spooky backdrop a suitable foundation.Sending Henry Morlant to the tomb in the first 15 minutes,the writers take a hazy mystery route which tries to build up suspense for Henry's return,but fails thanks to the writers not giving any of the other characters distinctive features,and also holding back Henry's jewel from being the driving force behind the Horror mystery, until the last minute.With Karloff's prescience being locked in the tomb for most of the title,the rest of the cast sadly make his absence from the screen be one that is strongly felt,with Anthony Bushell giving an incredibly stilted,dry performance as Ralph Morlant.Returning to the UK,Boris Karloff gives a great performance as Prof. Henry Morlant,with Karloff revealing Morlant to be in a decaying near-zombie state,as Morlant comes out of the tomb.", "Karloff never looked worse with those sunken eyes and facial putty. It's interesting that he gets top billing, considering how ineffectual he is and how little time he spends on the screen. The film does look good with the old mansion and the dark corners, but it eventually turns into one of those farcical in the door, out the door, in a window, out a window movies, with silly characters bumping into each other, terrified. The beginning is quite good as we learn of a mysterious stone of great value. It is thought to be able to bring back the dead. Then there is all that fainting. Were all the women hypoglycemic? I counted five times. I did enjoy looking at Ernest Thesiger from Bride of Frankenstein. The rest of the cast were good actors caught in a comedic clunker. By the way, is it ever explained how Karloff died and came back with superhuman qualities? If it weren't for all the great actors, it wouldn't have been much.", "A Gaumont British picture, not copyrighted in the U.S.A. Original U.S. release through Gaumont-British: December 1933.

U.K. release: 26 August 1933. 7,217 feet. 80 minutes.SYNOPSIS: A valuable jewel, \"The Eternal Light,\" is stolen from a famous Egyptian tomb and comes into the possession of Professor Morlant (Boris Karloff). Believing in the powers of the ancient Egyptian gods, Morlant is confident it will give him immortality. On his deathbed, the professor instructs his servant, Laing (Ernest Thesiger), to bind the jewel in his hand after his death. Before expiring, he warns Laing if his jewel is stolen, he will rise from the dead to seek revenge.NOTES: Made at the Gaumont British Studios in Shepherd's Bush, this was Karloff's first film in his native England. It is also allegedly \"the first real attempt at a British horror film.\" It was re-made in 1961 as a Carry On type comedy called either \"What a Carve Up!\" or \"No Place Like Homicide\".COMMENT: For the first half-hour or so, this develops as a really outstandingly spooky horror piece, with fantastic sets, appropriately hideous make-up, fascinatingly bizarre characters, stylish direction, dramatically atmospheric photography and a powerfully chilling music score. Once stiffly staid hero Bushell and comic relief scaredy-cat Harrison come on, however, tension lapses somewhat; \u2014 but only to be marvelously revived when Karloff re- appears in his new and even more sinister guise.Karloff, Thesiger and Sir Cedric Hardwicke run rings around the rest of the players, though Ralph Richardson makes a good try and Miss Hyson is an appealing heroine.Junge's sets are marvels of atmospheric horror which often dwarf the characters. This is as it should be. The sets and the make-up in horror films often contribute more atmosphere than the usually one- dimensional characters and melodramatic plots \u2014 which are all really variations on that single theme which brings diverse and weird characters into conflict with the real or imagined supernatural in an appropriately spooky setting.To list all the films and plays which use this device would exhaust our pages so I'll just cite one: \"The Cat and the Canary\". Notice the similarities: wills, heirs, fabulous fortunes, spooky old mansions, the undead, imperiled heroines, ancient servants, lawyers, comics, characters who turn out to be something other than they appear.It's hard to go wrong with this sort of picture, but by the same token it's difficult to do really well unless you've got the sort of money and highly professional expertise that went into this \"Ghoul\".Available on a superb DVD from Hollywood Movie Classics.", "In his quest for the 'eternal light', Professor Henry Morlant (Boris Karloff) dies with a fabled jewel granting immortality wrapped into his clutched fist before he expires. Subsequently, the jewel becomes the target of an assortment of thieves who desire it for their own purposes. \"The Ghoul\" is a dark and atmospheric early talkie horror flick from Britain, one of those films that aficionados of the genre say is a must see. The picture has it's moments, and Karloff fans, myself included, will raise an eyebrow over that ghastly self mutilation scene after his character returns from the dead. What takes away from the picture somewhat is the inclusion of an unnecessary gimmick involving a secondary character, Miss Kaney (Kathleen Harrison), who's starry eyed over an Egyptian opportunist, Aga Ben Dragore (Harold Huth). Dragore's also after the eternal light bauble, and I was wondering if he might dispatch her out of desperation at some moment.I've been waiting to see this film for some time, and reading other reviews on this board make me realize why it's been a rare treat up till now. The picture showed up on Turner Classic this morning and it turned out to be worth the wait. Perhaps a bit dark in spots, the story is a good one given it's era, and Karloff fans should be reasonably pleased. One will note that he often gives his character a pacing that recalls his Frankenstein Monster, along with a bit of The Mummy without the bandages.", "This film is a curiosity in the classic horror field and it easily gained a cult-status for some very simple reasons. First of all, because \"The Ghoul\" was the very first British horror film with sound, and that's quite spectacular since Britain would later become one of most eminent horror-producing countries (with Hammer, Tigon, etc\u0085). Secondly \u0096 and more importantly \u0096 \"The Ghoul\" was considered a lost film for many decades, so when a reasonably undamaged copy was discovered, naturally many Boris Karloff fans wanted to see it right away. So, purely talking trivia, this film is well worth a purchase. On the other hand, however, it's a very uneven and lacking thriller that doesn't deliver many chills. Especially compared to other classic Karloff-titles of that period (like \"Frankenstein\", \"The Mummy\" or \"The Old Dark House\"), \"The Ghoul\" is slow-paced and unmemorable. The film stars Boris Karloff (with an impressive pair of eyebrows) as a dying professor who believes an Egyptian jewel will grant him immortality. He wishes to be buried with it, but when his servant steals it from his tomb, the professor resurrects as a zombie on a quest for revenge. Half way through the screenplay, the story all of a sudden turns into a comedy with a whole bunch of bizarre characters that're all chasing a treasure they don't know. Some of the dialogues are very well written but the film lacks action and atmosphere. Simply put, \"The Ghoul\" is really tedious whenever Boris Karloff is not on screen. And, unfortunately, that's for about 75% of the entire length.", "A tricky one to review in some ways, for someone like myself who loves to submerge himself in anything Noir, Expressionistic or Gothic. There's also the added impact value here of the cast list, with Karloff, Hardwicke, Thesiger and Richardson making a quadruple list of British treasures. While of course there's the not so small fact that the film was sort of lost for decades, and even when it surfaced it was the victim of some awful transfers onto home entertainment formats. So it has been like discovering a Holy Grail of Karloff movies to finally have it available with a very good transfer.The Ghoul is very uneven and it takes the slow-burn approach to the extreme, even rendering much of the film as ponderous. A better director than T. Hayes Hunter could have made this story work, which in essence is a bit of a \"Mummy\" clone in all but name. It's crammed with characters musing about the plot dynamics, which is pointless because we have grasped very early on in the play what we need to know. There's some over acting, which again a better director would have reined in, while the action sequences are poorly constructed. But...It looks absolutely terrific. In the pantheon of Old Dark House movies, this is top draw. G\u00fcnther Krampf photographs it with his Germanic Expressionistic badge pinned firmly on his chest. Boasting Nosferatu and Pandora's Box as photographic assignments on his CV, Krampf blitzes The Ghoul with such atmosphere and mood setting skills, his work really deserves a far better movie. It's creaky for the wrong reasons, and it very much proves to be a product of its time, but it's an important movie in the history of British horror. These things, coupled with the photography, make it one you need to at least see and tick of your list. 5/10"], "tt0024184": ["James Whale is, for good reason, most famous for his Frankenstein films. However, better than both (albeit marginally) is this film - The Invisible Man. When I first saw this, I couldn't believe that it's over seventy years old and upon a second viewing; the film just gets better and better. Considering the time in which it was made, The Invisible Man is one of the most amazing films of all time. The special effects are what really make the film. CGI has pretty much spoilt this sort of reaction to a movie. The Invisible Man really has that 'how did they do it?' feel, which movie audiences of yesteryear so often enjoyed, and it's done such a good job with it that I'm still wondering today. The plot gives way to lots of trickery and visual magic as it follows a mad scientist who has turned himself invisible. However, things aren't so simple because one of the drugs he used has properties that can turn a man insane; and this side of the drug has had a huge effect on our man. Believing he can take over the world, he recruits the help of one of his fellow scientists and sets about a reign of invisible terror.You would think that it would be hard to convince an audience that one of your characters is invisible; but Whale makes it look easy! Claude Rains spends much of the film either under the cover of bandages or not even in it, but it doesn't matter because it's not him but his voice that makes the performance. The fiendishness of his voice is compelling and pure evil, and I don't believe that there is a better man in existence for this role. There isn't a lot of physical acting for him to do, but this is made up for with a dazzling array of special effects. We get to see a shirt move on it's own, things fly around rooms and havoc is caused. It really shows Whale's genius to pull this off. Whale is best known as a horror director, but it's obvious that he has a great respect for comedy also as his Frankenstein films were very tongue-in-cheek, and so is this film. The scenes that see the invisible man causing mayhem are hilarious, and will delight anyone who sees the film. Whale's ability to entertain is absolute, and that is why the films he made for the studio were always the biggest successes. The Invisible Man is one of the greatest achievements in cinema history, and anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong!", "Talented direction from James Whale. Mildly chilling tale based on the imagination of H.G. Wells. Introduction to a versatile star, Claude Rains. Short movie in length, but the mixture of thrills, chills and humor help make this a real classic. The special effects of the 30's seem so unsophisticated, but very enjoyable to this day. Rain's starring debut is 99.98 percent vocal and very memorable. The changes in his voice from glee to madness gives certain character to his invisible role.A brilliant chemist/scientist(Rains) discovers how to make himself invisible. He wrecks havoc in a small British country village as pranks turn to murder. Memorable are the scenes of the invisible man smoking and riding a bicycle; and of course unwrapping.Also in the cast are:William Harrigan, Gloria Stuart, E.E. Clive and Una O'Connor. At a certain point you wish that O'Connor's funny, but obnoxious character was shorter lived. Dated or not, this is a classic that still demands watching. Creepy and fun for all.", "Oh! What a wonderful film!  The Invisible Man is fraught with witty dialogue, excellent character acting, inventive and creative special effects, insightful direction, and solid, tight scripting.  The story is about a scientist that develops a serum which turns himself invisible, for good intent initially.  The serum has negative side effects, one of which is turning the scientist into a raving,mad megalomaniac bent on conquering mankind and the world.  What is most surprising about the film is its rather perverse sense of black humour(a James Whale specialty) and its cruelty. The Invisible Man is not a benign horror monster but rather a frightening, destructive force capable of acts of violence, madness, and viciousness. The direction is the real star of the film as Whale combines script, acting, mood, and setting amidst the background of ground-breaking special effects that are still impressive to this day.  Whale laces his special humour throughout, and this film has no shortage of dark comedic moments.  The acting all around is very good with people like Henry Travers, Gloria Stuart, Una O'Connor and William Harrigan especially as a jealous doctor giving all the support they can to a formless Claude Rains.  Rains's voice is magnificent and one senses he was made to play the part that would make him famous.  Look for Dwight Frye in a small role.  A wonderful film experience!", "This film version of the H.G. Wells science fiction classic works very well. It has a number of strengths, but it benefits most of all from James Whale's direction, creativity, and technical excellence. Both the flashier aspects of the movie (such as the \"invisibility\" effects) and also most of the basic elements are done with skill.The story is for the most part based on the one main idea of \"The Invisible Man\" who combines his scientific genius with a generous supply of madness. The story is interesting enough in itself, and of course it provides all kinds of opportunities for visual tricks. Whale hits just the right balance in making good use of these opportunities without over-indulging himself.The visual effects themselves are of excellent quality, and they are far better than all but the very best of the present-day computer imagery. While it is usually rather easy to spot which parts of a movie are computer-generated, Whale's effects are all but seamless, with the exception of a handful of brief moments. They are often quite impressive, without resorting to tired devices, such as explosions and the like, in order to impress those with shorter attention spans.Claude Rains does quite well for having such limitations on what he could do. The rest of the cast is solid, if mostly unspectacular, letting the story do the work. Una O'Connor somewhat overdoes it with the screaming this time, but otherwise the characters are believable. The acting may seem slightly quaint to those who are accustomed to the pretentious styles of the present generation of performers, but it's certainly better than the grating, self-important performances in some of the recent movies of the same genre.While the story does not have the thematic depth or the suggestive imagery of horror classics like \"Frankenstein\" or \"Dracula\", this adaptation gets everything it can out of the material, telling the story in an entertaining fashion and with technical skill.", "Spoiler ahead - a well known one though.It was his first major film role, and he only appeared at the tale end of the movie for a minute - as a corpse! But Claude Rains was made as of that moment, though it would be awhile before he actually ceased being a villain in all of his films.James Whale's THE INVISIBLE MAN is possibly the best of the early Universal horror series of the 1930s. FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula (both English and Spanish versions) are great films too, but the threat of Jack Griffin's discovery of invisibility makes the other two seem quaint as threats. One can run from Frankenstein, and one can stay indoors at night with a handy cross or garlic available. But how does one fully protect oneself against someone who is physically strong, mentally smart, and totally determined to kill you if you cannot see him? It's not easy, especially if the goal of this monster is to rule over others. As he puts it, he wishes to have the world grovel at his feet.In the novel, Griffin's personality is shown to be so selfish from the start that one can tell that no matter what discovery he would have made he would have misused it for power. He has no redeeming features at all. However, his omnipotence is sort of curbed in one way that is not the case in the film. A character is invented by Wells (who is not in the movie) that Griffin frightens into serving as a slave or servant. The character manages to run off with Griffin's chemistry lab and chemicals, as well as Griffin's notebooks. As a result he is trapped in his invisibility, and can't get out of this situation until the novel ends.The film does have some classic moments of humor (Whale liked to add black humor to his films). When a woman runs screaming down the lane at night followed by an empty pair of pants skipping along reciting \"here we go gathering nuts in May\" is one. So (more darkly) is during a massive search for Griffin, after he causes a train disaster. One of the volunteers, slightly apart from the others, is grabbed and thrown down and choked. Rains/Griffin, in speaking, says, \"Here I am...AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU FOUND ME?!!\" It is a chilling moment.A wonderful blend of thrills and comedy, surrounding a science fiction tale of constant interest, this film never disappoints. I give it a 10 for entertainment value. For helping awaken viewers to reading the works of Herbert George Wells, I'd give it a 12.", "People tend to use the word \"classic\" too freely. I can't help but laugh when I hear some of the movies that people call \"classics\". The term gets thrown around so much that it often looses some of its importance and real meaning. I try to reserve \"classic\" to a select group of films that I believe have achieved a certain status and have withstood the test of time. And I have no problem putting the label \"classic\" on The Invisible Man.James Whale made a lot of great films in the 1930s. Some (Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, for example) may be better known, but I've always thought of The Invisible Man as the best of the bunch. It's got everything. Terrific performances, incredible special effects, nice comedic touches, and technical brilliance are found in abundance throughout the film.Terrific Performances: For someone who only has a few seconds of actual screen time, Claude Rains is amazing. His voice creates such a presence that at times it's easy to forget that he's not actually there. As for Una O'Connor, I've seen some people complain about Whale's use of her, but I think she was never better than in The Invisible Man. She's great whether playing the proper landlord showing a new guest to his room or as the overly hysterical woman afraid for her life. The rest of the cast, especially E.E. Clive and Gloria Stuart, is exceptional.Incredible Special Effects: It's amazing to revisit The Invisible Man and see how well the special effects have withstood the passage of time. They were state-of-the-art in 1933 and they remain impressive today. It took some real craftsmanship to pull-off the invisibility gags seen in The Invisible Man. To me, none is more impressive than the first time we get a glimpse under the bandages while he's eating and we see no lower jaw. Impressive stuff!Nice Comedic Touches: Billed as a horror film, The Invisible Man actually contains more scenes of humor than horror. I've already mentioned O'Connor, but she's only a small part of the humor in the film. The police, the various frightened passersby, and even Claude Rains himself add to the fun found in The Invisible Man. I'm of the opinion that it never goes overboard, but fits nicely into the plot.Technical Brilliance: Beyond the special effects, the film is wonderful from a technical standpoint. Lighting, cinematography, and set design are incredible and some of the best of the 30s. Everything looks perfect. In my opinion, Whale never did better. I've always been impressed by the way Whale used his camera as part of the action when many of his contemporaries seemed content with the \"plant it and shoot\" style of film-making.The only negative aspect of the film that I can possibly complain about is William Harrigan in the role of Rains' rival, Dr. Arthur Kemp. He's just not as good as those around him. Other than that little quibble, I've got nothing to complain about. I believe it should be easy to see why I, for one, consider The Invisible Man a classic!", "There's a snow storm blowing ferociously, a man trundles towards a signpost that reads Iping. He enters a hostelry called The Lions Head, the patrons of the bar fall silent for the man is bound in bandages. He tells, not asks, the landlady; \"I want a room with a fire\". This man is Dr. Jack Griffin, soon to wreak havoc and be known as The Invisible Man.One of the leading lights of the Universal Monster collection of films that terrified and enthralled audiences back in the day. Directed by genre master James Whale, The Invisible Man is a slick fusion of dark humour, berserker science and genuine evil. Quite a feat for a film released in 1933, even more so when one samples the effects used in the piece. Effects that are still today holding up so well they put to shame some of the toy like expensive tricks used by the modern wave of film makers. John P. Fulton take a bow sir.After Boris Karloff had turned down the chance to play the good doctor gone crazy, on account of the role calling for voice work throughout the film only, except a snippet at the finale, so Whale turned to Claude Rains. Small in stature but silky in voice, Rains clearly sensed an opportunity to launch himself into Hollywood. It may well be, with Whale's expert guidance of course, that he owes his whole career to that 30 second appearance of his face at the end of the film? As was his want, Whale filled out the support cast with odd ball eccentrics that are acted adroitly by the British & Irish thespians. Una O'Connor, Forrester Harvey, Edward E. Clive and Henry Travers are memorable. While American Gloria Stuart as the power insane Griffin's love interest is radiant with what little she has to do.Based on the now famous story written by H.G. Wells, Whale and R. C. Sheriff's (writer) version remains the definitive Invisible Man adaptation. There's some changes such as the time it is set, and Griffin is not the lunatic he is in the film, which is something that Wells was not too pleased about in spite of liking the film as a whole, but it's still very tight to the source. Sequels, TV series and other modern day adaptations would follow it, but none are as shrewd or as chilling as Whale's daddy is. 9/10", "Claude Rains. The man. The myth. The legend. You cannot talk about this film, whether in conversation or in any review, without placing this actor on the tip of your tongue. He is the epitome of the madness that surrounded the power-hungry Invisible Man. In this day of modern cinematic wonder, most full-fledged actors would want their faces to be in front of the camera, showcasing the entire film. Directors would want this fledgling star to promote their film, get kiddies interested in spending their money, and for financiers to see the profits of their contributions. Let's face it, if Brad Pitt is in a movie, typically most audience members are actually going to \"see\" Brad Pitt. Thankfully, we have directors like James Whale and his interpretation of H.G.Wells' classic The Invisible Man. Whale took a powerful story, expanded it, breathed life into it, and followed up with quite possibly one of the most sinister villains in movie horror history since Hannibal Lector. He is crude, he is heartless, and he wants nothing more than world domination \u0085 he is Claude Rains \u0085 and yet, until the end of the film, we never see the white's of his eyes.There are several reasons why I just fell in love with this film, outside of the cataclysmic performance of Claude Rains. Ohhhh, Claude Rains. I loved the way that this movie was filmed. I loved the scope of the Invisible Man's terror. Whale could have kept his antagonist to committing just single murders of friends and family, he could of just kept it confined to just one single town, he could have kept our focus directly on the turmoil of Rains, but instead, he decided (amazingly!) to open the entire can of worms with success. When I first began this film I was expecting the classic images of angry villagers with pitchforks storming the house that the Invisible Man lived within, but instead, Whale gave us this sort of random chaos that truly created fear around this character. Whale is able to give us the true terror of this madman by perhaps expanding his budget and showing us how big the terror of the Invisible Man is. For example, I never foresaw the horrific train accident, nor the random worker push off the mountain, and when Rains explained to Kemp what the human impact of falling down a ravine would be like, it literally sent shivers down my spine. Whale created a madman better than some modern horror films could ever accomplish.For a film created in the 1930s, the special effects were spectacular. Sure, CGI was just a glimmer in Lucas' mother's eyes, but James Whale did a superb job of giving us these rare glimpses into the future of special effects. The way that he created the Invisible Man surprised me. I did not expect to ever see the creature without his bandages on, but within ten minutes we are shown the full scope of Whale's creativity. I thought the use of snow, dust, and even the early stages of the overused \"green screen\" was original for its time. To see Rains smoke as the Invisible Man put a smile on my face. This is a perfect example of a film that used just enough special effects, in the right way, to make the audience forget for a brief time that this was in fact a film \u0085 not real life. While the special effects did have one or two flaws (see the Invisible Man riding the stolen bike \u0096 were those wires?), I must credit Whale for pushing the envelope for the time. It was surprising to see such quality from such an older film.If there would be anything that I would change about this film would be the subtext concerning the relationship between Rains and Flora (played by Titanic star Gloria Stuart). I thought this was nearly unnecessary. I understand the value of trying to give a human element to this monster, but I thought that it could have been done without these random scenes. There wasn't really any connection between the two, and we were left with very little information of them prior to the start of the film. Perhaps if there had been a stronger pre-story it would have congealed better. The same can be said for the chemistry and reasonings for the plot points surrounding Rains and Kemp. I could understand why they occurred during the film, but there had to be something more prior to the opening scene. I wanted to know more. I think that is a good sign for a film, when you are left wondering what was the story before this one \u0085 and even what was it afterwards.Overall, I thought this was an exceptional film. I now have this newfound respect for Claude Rains, a man I knew nothing about prior to watching this film. He carried this film and honestly successfully pulled off one of the most frightening madmen this world has ever seen. I think what scared me the most about him was the fact that he actually, unlike some villains, actually followed through with his vile plans. He was evil, whether the invisibility did it or not, he was pure evil, and I loved every minute of it. The special effects were delightful, with a small subplot that this picture could have gone without. Amazing, and a perfect treat before Halloween!Grade: ***** out of *****", "Apart from Bride of Frankenstein, this is probably my favorite Universal horror movie. It has been overshadowed by Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein and the Mummy, but it's every bit as good as the best of these. That's because unlike these other films where you have real monsters, you have a \"normal\" man who becomes invisible and then slowly begins to act in an incredibly psychopathic way. At first, he kills with some hesitation. Later, he laughs maniacally as he kills with great style and panache--laughing diabolically after he ties a guy up and pushes the car with the man inside it off a cliff! It becomes an exploration of the inner evil within us all and so the sense of connection to the \"monster\" is greater than with traditional monsters because he's just like you and me--it's just that accursed formula that brings out the madness.Claude Rains, though invisible for much of the movie, does a great job--his voice is one of the greatest in movie history. And the special effects, with one silly exception, are unbelievable for the 1930s--in fact, by today's standards most of them are terrific (especially for the scene where he slowly becomes visible). As I mentioned, there was one silly exception. Late in the movie, the invisible man removes his clothes to try to escape. However, his footprints clearly are those of a person wearing shoes! Oops.Also, while it is a great way and gave it a 10 because it is such a marvelous film, there is one problem with the film (not the footprints--that was more of a funny mistake). Una O'Connor made parts of the film VERY difficult to watch due to her horrible over-acting (you'll see more of this in \"The Bride of Frankenstein\"). Her shrieking and histrionics were way overboard--and quite annoying. Subtle, it ain't!! And this is a shame, as the rest of the movie is so wonderful.", "I was interested in seeing this film. I like the book, I love Claude Rains and I loved the classics Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein which were also directed by horror maestro James Whale. After finally seeing it I wasn't let down. The only minor problem I had was that Una O'Connor's screaming occasionally got on my nerves, but that's to do with preference. The Invisible Man had held up amazingly well, and the production values look lavish and don't look as though they've creaked. The music is excellent, the direction is top-notch and the screenplay is great. The story is still compelling and does justice to the book, while the atmosphere is suitably eerie and the special effects are pioneering. The acting is fine, Claude Rains was a brilliant actor and gives a superb performance in the title role, despite the fact he spends most of the time swathed in bandages or invisible you know that wonderful voice he has anywhere. All in all, superb and anyone who loved the Frankenstein movies will love this. 9/10 Bethany Cox", "I actually saw The Invisible Man (1933) shortly after I saw the James Whale bio-pic Gods and Monsters (1998), starring Ian MacKellan and Brendan Fraser. So it was with that image of the director in my head that I watched this film. Claude Rains (Casablanca) is perfectly cast as the mad scientist/invisible man. The remainder of the cast, though not really challenged much, are more than serviceable in what they are required to do. As has been mentioned by most of the other posters, the special effects hold up rather well even today. An amazing feat considering the film is over 70 years old! The DVD has several interesting documentaries / commentaries that made me appreciate not only this film's entertainment value but its historical significance as well.", "This is definitely one of the best horror/sci-fi movies of all-time. The special effects are absolutely off the chart for 1933. I can only imagine the shock of the audiences on opening night back in 1933. \"The Invisible Man\" must have been the equivilant of Star Wars in terms of special effects for the time period. If you have never seen this movie, find it!", "THE INVISIBLE MAN (1933) **** Claude Rains is super scary as mad scientist Griffin in HG Wells' classic horror novel about the power of being invisible thanks to a serum with some dangerous effects.  Atmospherically directed by James Whale (\"Frankenstein\").  Great visual effects for its time that stand up well to today's standards.  Chilling.", "It's interesting to note that for a Hollywood studio how little American input went in to Universal . It was founded by a German Carl Leammle and the studio is best known for its horror output in the 1930s . Everyone knows of Karloff and Lugosi who were respectively British and Hungarian . The folklore of werewolves that everyone takes as being traditional is not traditional at all but were invented by German Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 Curt Siodmak for THE WOLF MAN . Perhaps the most important figure in the Universal horror cycle was James Whale a British born director who moved the production of JOURNEY'S END from the UK to America because the Americans had more sophisticated sound equipment and Whale decided to stay . When one points out that Michael Curtiz who worked for Warner Bros was Hungarian born you do realise that how much the Golden age of Hollywood owes so much to Europe . Europeans in general and Brits in particular should take great pride in thisTHE INVISIBLE MAN is effectively a British film made in America .The setting is British The director is British , the leading man and most of the cast are Brits as is the screenwriter who's adapted the novel from HG Wells who is ... go on guess ? The British are well known for their sense of humour and this is where THE INVISIBLE MAN succeeds . It has a wickedly delightful sense of sadistic humour running throughout it . I'm not entirely sure if all of it's intentional watching it today but certainly watching a pair of trousers chasing a woman along a dark country road whilst it sings \" Here we go chasing nuts in May , nuts in May ... \" had me laughing out loud . There is something cruelly endearing listening to Claude Rain's precise upper class tone as he threatens and goads the supporting characters in the film along with gloriously scathing dialogue lke \" It's so cold it can freeze the icickles off an Eskimo \"Rain's is superb and totally dominates the film with his voice alone but there's a rather old fashioned acting style to some of the other players which is at odds to Whale's wonderfully fast paced directing style . But even this caricature of \" Cor blimey guv \" type Britons adds an endearing feel to the movie . I really can't think of another film from the same period that is more enjoyable and enchanting than this one . Apparently someone called Herbert George Wells wasn't too pleased with the movie but he'd obviously forgotten his roots and that it was our sense of humour that made Great Britain great", "This was great the first time I watched it, but slowly declined with multiple viewings over the years.Why I slowly lost interest in this, I'm not sure, except for perhaps the incredibly annoying hysterical woman character played by Una O'Connor. Her constant screaming and shrieking took away my enjoyment of this film.This was Claude Rains' first starring role and he did a fine job, even though you never see his face until the final minutes. His voice was good and his character interesting as he slowly went insane. He had this silly, sadistic laugh as he'd kill people. That's one thing that made this movie a bit different. When I watched this on DVD after a long absence, I was shocked to re-discover how violent Rains' character was in this film.Even though the film is almost 75 years old, it's still fairly entertaining and not dated as much as you might expect. It also brings out a few interesting dilemmas that an invisible human being would have trying to stay undetected.By the way, I still think this should be classified \"science fiction,\" not horror.", "Scientist Griffin disappears from his lab, leaving his colleagues Kemp and Cranley wondering where he has gone. Meanwhile a strange man arrives at an inn, covered in bandages, hat and long coat and acting mysterious. When the other residents of the inn claim that this man is 'invisible', police assume they are suffering some sort of group delusion. Meanwhile Griffin arrives back to see Kemp, clearly (sorry!) invisible and suffering side effects of madness. With his friends trying to help him and the police trying to catch him, Griffin's inability to find a cure continues to eat at his sanity, sending him into a frenzy.The first thing to note is that any film that is over 70 years old will clearly not hold the same appeal to modern audiences as films made recently do. Those looking to this film to provide the same effects or violence as seen in Hollow Man (for example) will not only be disappointed but they will also be open to accusations of being simply unfair. However, viewed on its own terms, this is a great little film that has impressive effects, an exciting and tragic story mixed with some good (if a little hammy) acting. The basic plot works well, considering that it expects us to be right there with it without any real back story about who Griffin was. I'm not sure why this was done this way (constraints of running time maybe?) but it works well as the film is to fast moving to be slowed by a long build up. It still manages to show Griffin's descent into madness despite the fact he is already losing at the start of the film.The effects work well even if they (obviously) don't compare to what computers can do, however they still look good and the lead character is convincingly invisible; if anything it is actually more effective because the 'money shots' are sparingly used and then used to good effect. The pace of the film really helps as it is remains exciting and enjoyable all the way to the inevitable conclusion. The acting of the cast helps although it is Rains' film the whole way to the final scene (where he is finally seen!). He may overplay his madness but who can complain when it is such fun? What impressed me is that he is either invisible or behind a mask for the vast majority of the film but yet still manages to make a big impression regardless. Stuart didn't impress me one bit and seemed like her character would have been important with backstory \u0096 but without it she just came across as a simpering starlet with little involvement in the story, trying to build a human side that was not the focus of the rest of the film. Harrigan and Travers are convincing and the support cast all run around and scream accordingly.Overall this is an enjoyable film that has good effects and an enjoyable plot. The script could have done more to create more of a human story and draw more emotion from the audience but the fast pace and convincing thrills cover this up well. I was taken by how dark the material was \u0096 I never expected the 'hero' of the film to kill innocents, this helped me get into it because I was quite shocked by it; this was again more effective than the graphic and obvious gore of modern versions. Not a perfect film but a classic one and rightly so!", "Writing about 30's Black-And-White movies can be difficult, as they need to be considered in light of the era the films were made. You have to adopt the mind-set of some-one viewing it for the first time, without the baggage of umpteen remakes and special effects improvements, to remain objective. Here goes:Claude Rains does a good job with a mainly \"speaking\" part - lots of emotion and command there. Una O'Connor as the Innkeepers wife does a bit too much shrieking for my liking - but required \"reaction\" acting fodder for the time, I assume.The effects still hold up, and must have been cutting edge at the time. The storyline covers all the basics of the Wells Novel - a quest for knowledge and power, alienation and drug inducessed madness. It's an enjoyable watch with good pacing and steady performances throughout. A sort of lazy Sunday afternoon type of movie.Universal's take on a British Pub raises a smile, with some fantastic looking weathered-faced locals populating the place. I love the way the gag with a local \"fake-playing\" a coin driven piano gets a roaring laugh (as if that's the first time the pub's drinkers have seen it). However, the British film-industry was putting out the same type of stereotypes, so Universal can be forgiven there.A part of Sci-Fi/Horror movie making history, and worth watching for this fact alone.", "What a lot of fun. I haven't read H. G. Wells' novel but this movie adaptation is pretty entertaining.Claude Raines is a scientist who discovers a drug that makes him invisible. All very well, except that he needs to find \"the antidote\" that will make him visible again. Until then, he exhibits on the sort of transparency most of us demand of our governments. There's another thing too. He didn't read the article in the obscure German medical journal that proves the drug drives you mad.Wrapped up from head to toe on a wintry night, Raines takes a room in a country inn and demands to be left along while he plies his instruments in search of the antidote. Of course no one is going to leave alone a person who asks to be left alone. The constant intrusions drive Raines round the bend. He goes on a merry rampage until he's finally undone by a smart police inspector, but not before he kills more than a hundred people, including a former friend and colleague.Ordinarily these stories of humans (or part-humans) gone nuts involve an underlying theme of pathos. Let's face facts. I guess no one felt sorry for the giant ants in \"Them\" but who among us didn't shed a tear or two when King Kong made a splash on 34th Street? That pathos is largely absent here. Only in two scenes, both brief and in both of which his former girl friend, Flora, appears, is there any real sign of humanity in Raines' character, a willingness to take the role of Other. These few minutes aside, he's an explosive personality.Which brings up the question of exactly what it is that he wants. He carries on about \"power\" and \"fear\" and the ability to walk into any bank vault, yet he never makes any relevant demands. In one scene he does walk into a bank and skip out with a tray full of money but he throws it away to the crowd. He seems mostly to get a kick out of people being terrified of him. He hops down the road in a pair of stolen trousers, driving off a frightened woman, and sings, \"Here we go gathering nuts in May....\" He clearly enjoys all the rumors of the invisible man creating chaos. The rumors sound silly and the movie makes a little fun of them but we shouldn't feel too superior, since we're given to equally absurd panics. Google \"phantom gasser Mattoon\" for a more modern example. And did you know that McDonald's puts worms in its hamburgers? Claude Raines is pretty good, perhaps more effective in his angry rants than in his few tender moments. The other players are very amusing. When the raving Raines first peels off his guise and reveals himself to be invisible, a goggling constable says, \"Ewww, he's all eaten away.\" Best performance: Una O'Connor as the head of the country inn, a delicate and restrained blend of extreme hysteria and excess horror.You have to admire the thought that went into this fantasy. It reminded me of Nicholson Baker's \"The Fermata.\" It's not a tale of whimsy in which anything can happen. Raines describes the flaws in his invisibility. Not just obvious things like fog and snow, in which his form is outlined, but the dirt under his fingernails and the food that takes an hour to be digested and lose its opacity. And he must not step in a sticky substance with his naked feet or he leaves prints. And in industrial settings he must mind the soot that settles on his body. It almost sounds like more trouble than it's worth unless his plans include sneaking into the girls' gym or something.You will not be bored.", "Director James Whale made a prolific 20 films between 1930 and 1941 and all them were not only good but many were true classics like Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, The Man in the Iron Mask, Journey's End, Remember Last Night, Showboat, (the original) Waterloo Bridge and The Ivisible Man. Whale ended up in a losing battle over creative control of his films with the studios and in 1941 at the age of 52 he walked off the set of They Dare Not Love and never made another movie again. The Invisible Man is a very creative film and it gave Claude Rains a career in films. Rains is excellent in this film although of course little of him is on screen being invisible and all. Gloria Stuart costars. Screenwriter R.C. Sheriff who would write screenplays for such films as Goodbye Mr. Chips, That Hamilton Woman and Odd Man Out adapted the H.G. Welles novel for the screen in The Invisible Man. The major problem I have with this film is it's just a little too short. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10 and recommend it.", "This year, 2003, it's been 70 years since HG Wells' the Invisible Man was made. It's a very long time ago, but this film hasn't lost anything of his power yet. If you watch it these days, you still see a movie with lots of suspense and amazingly good special effects. Really, although it was made in 1933, the effects are flawless and very believable. Dr. Griffin discovered a drug which makes you invisible. At first, he only wanted to prove himself as a good scientist towards his girlfriend, but pretty soon he realizes a man has a lot more possibilities when he can not be seen. Blinded by power, he turns into a madman who terrorizes a small town and kills police men. Only when his girlfriend appears ( she's also his boss' daughter ) he seems to be reasonable again. Can she change his mind and make his thoughts normal again?A very high level op suspense is reached here in the Invisible Man. Surely a lot more than in nowadays horror films to say the least. No matter how hard they try to be scary nowadays, it always make me laugh instead of being frightened. This film doesn't do that. The atmosphere and the black and white screen give a lot of extra value to the story. Claude Rains is excellent as usual. He is one of my favorite actors during this wonderful decade of horror. Sure, he didn't became as famous as Boris Karoff or Bela Lugosi, but he played a few very memorable early movie 'monsters' as well. In this movie of course and also in Phantom of the Opera (1943). The girl he's in love with here is played by Gloria Stewart. It's funny to see her act her while you know she'll receive an Oscar nomination 65 years later for the biggest movie production ever : Titanic. This particular film comes with my highest recommendation. It's a must see for all and I give it a rating 10 out of 10. If possible, try to watch it in the right atmosphere. During a cold and dark winter night for example. With the lights turned down and maybe a few candles lit. If you follow these tips, you'll certainly wonder a few times if someone invisible isn't standing in the same room with you....", "Claude Rains (in the role that made him a star) is a scientist who discovers the secret of invisibility. Unfortunately he has no antidote for it. Also a side effect of the chemicals slowly make him go mad-- he thinks he can conquer the world and thinks nothing of murdering a few people.This has never reached the heights of other Universal horror pictures of the time like \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein\". Probably because you never see Rains (until the very end) and it, basically, isn't very scary. Still this is worth catching.Rains manages to convey his character's madness just by his voice--quite an achievement. Gloria Stuart is around in a nothing part as his girlfriend--but she looks stunning. The special effects are (even by todays standards) impressive. Some are obvious but most of them work. The most impressive is at the beginning when he unwraps the bandages around his head to show people. Also director James Whale wisely doesn't take the material TOO seriously--his sense of humor comes through again and again. Also this is one of the first horror films were a scientist admits that he tampered with things that were best left alone.See it for the special effects and Rains' performance (so to speak). An 8.", "Having never read H.G. Wells' novel, I don't know whether or not the movie followed the story. But whether or not it did, \"The Invisible Man\" does have some good lessons about what we shouldn't attempt. Claude Rains plays scientist Jack Griffin, whose experiments make him turn invisible and give him a murderous streak. Sixty-four years before she played Kate Winslet's older self, Gloria Stuart plays Griffin's love interest Flora Cranley. I think that my favorite scene was when Griffin stole a bicycle, so the bicycle basically rode itself.It's weird to think...Gloria Stuart is the only actress who has worked with both Claude Rains and Leonardo DiCaprio. Well...", "What a great show this was. Claude Rains plays Jack Griffin, a scientist who discovers a formula with which he renders himself invisible. The only side effect of the drug is that it also slowly drives the subject insane.The special effects are terrible, in many cases it's laughably obvious how they were created, but you need to remember that this film is almost 70 years old! For special effects like those in The Invisible Man to have been created in the early 1930s, when even SOUND was still fairly new, is extremely impressive.Even though the structure of The Invisible Man was fairly simple, there were elements of the story that showed how well thought out the movie was. Griffin points out that dirt on his feet, snow on his shoulders, and even dirt under his fingernails would be enough to give him away. He needs to wait a certain amount of time after he eats because until his food is fully digested, it is still visible (THAT would have been interesting to see).With The Invisible Man, James Whale has delivered yet another masterpiece, and I think that this is among the better ones. The film has definitely dated; the black and white photography is gritty, the camera movements are often jumpy, and the dialogue has that \"old movie\" scratchy sound to it, but none of these things should discourage anyone from watching this excellent film. It is one of the establishing films of horror/thriller history, and it should not be missed."], "tt0024188": ["The 1930s was a great decade for horror with classic titles like 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'Bride Of Frankenstein', 'Freaks', 'King Kong', 'The Invisible Man' and 'White Zombie'. I always thought 'Bride Of Frankenstein' was the best of the lot, but a VERY close second would have to be 'Island Of Lost Souls'. It truly is an extraordinary movie and still able to chill the blood and fire the imagination! It's easily the best version of H.G. Wells' 'The Island Of Dr Moreau' to date, and literally years ahead of its time. Many of the 1930s films made before the self imposed censorship of the Hays Code are quite startling and really pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable on screen. This movie is seventy years old but it still pretty disturbing even now. At the time it must have been something else! Especially the super sexy Lota The Panther Woman (Kathleen Burke). Charles Laughton plays Moreau and he is one of the greatest of screen villains. The quintessential megalomaniac mad scientist figure. Richard Arlen is pretty good as the hero, Edward Parker, who finds himself trapped on Moreau's island, and horror legend Bela Lugosi is unforgettable as the Sayer of the Law. I watched an old video copy of this movie with a lousy transfer and was still utterly transfixed. If this is available on DVD with the care and attention given to it that Universal have taken on their classic horror titles I will add it straight to the top of my (ever expanding!) \"must buy\" list. 'Island Of Lost Souls' is one of the greatest horror movies I've ever seen, and one that I can't recommend highly enough to any horror buff whatever your age or taste.", "Universal dominated the horror market of the 1930s, but every once in a while the other studios would produce a classic of their own.  `Island of Lost Souls,' produced by Paramount, is one such film.  It's tight, fast, and haunting.The most striking thing about `Island' is its claustrophobic, nightmarish atmosphere.  Some people criticize the hero, Edward Parker (Richard Arlen), as bland and colorless, but I think this works in the film's favor.  Since he has no personality of his own, he can be more of an Everyman; he also has no strength to draw upon and is therefore powerless against the horrors around him.  He sees the perverse monstrosities Moreau has created on his island, finds himself attracted to and then repulsed by the cat-woman Lota, and then struggles to free himself from Moreau's manipulative control.  It's like those nightmares where you try to run away from something terrible but your feet won't move.Charles Laughton steals the show as Dr. Moreau; his disarming, cherubic exterior somehow enhances his aura of menace.  He may not look as blatantly evil as Bela Lugosi, but after a few minutes you just know there's something terribly wrong with this man.  The irony is, the creatures Moreau creates are far more humane than he is.  The creatures themselves live in a tight society, bound by the laws Moreau has given them; instead of dwelling on their physical awfulness, the film imparts them with a curious dignity and innocence.  When the inevitable rebellion comes, I found myself cheering the creatures on, much like I felt my heart go out to the Frankenstein Monster or King Kong.`Island' is one of those movies you need to watch on a humid summer night, when your clothes cling to your skin and every breath feels like it's coming through a wet towel.  Feel the suspense and the terror seep into you, and then try to tell me the old horror movies weren't infinitely better than what passes for horror nowadays.", "For those unfamiliar, Island of Lost Souls (1933) is the earliest and easily the superior version of H.G. Wells' Dr. Moreau. This is a beautifully filmed movie that still supplies the creepy moments almost 70 years after being made.The basic story: A man rescued at sea is dropped off at an uncharted island owned by Dr. Moreau. The island is filled with strange \"natives\". The man soon learns that the natives are actually the creations of Dr. Moreau. Dr. Moreau is a god to his creations. But, once the \"natives\" learn that Dr. Moreau is not a god, they turn on him with horrifying consequences.Charles Laughton delivers one of the best performances in the history of horror as the mad Dr. Moreau. Dressed head-to-toe in white, he is as sinister as you get. A brilliant acting job. The rest of the cast is fine. Bela Lugosi, in a very small supporting role, is quite good. Kathleen Burke (Lota the Panther Woman) is also a stand out. But, this is Laughton's film and he makes the most of it.The very simple creature makeup is effective. The cinematography, etc. are also quite good. For example, there are several scenes with Moreau standing in the shadows that are especially effective.This is a film not to be missed. While it may not appeal to the hack and slash crowd, Island of Lost Souls is a wonderful horror movie. For what it's worth, I'll give this one 10/10. (It's a shame Paramount didn't make more horror films in the 30s.) One final thought, the ending of the film is very reminiscent of the ending of Freaks (1932) with the same savagery on display.", "From the H. G. Wells story, \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" this film is part horror story, part science fiction, and part moral fable. If the film works, it's because of Wells's writing and because of the simultaneously comforting and disturbing presence of Charles Laughton as Dr. Moreau. He is another sort of Dr. Frankenstein, a scientist whose hunger for discovery transforms genius and egotism into a pathology. Moreau has discovered a means of accelerating evolution by hundreds of millennia. His experiments with plants were harmless enough, but, banished to a tropical island, he forces beasts to evolve into men through sessions in the operating theatre he calls the House of Pain. The creatures are given the law, which they chant responsively: \"Are we not men?\" Into this scenario comes an innocent outsider, Parker (Richard Arlen), who rejects Moreau's vision and stands for truth and dignity-Arlen is a typical 30s hero, a bit of a stick figure, really, with good posture and a pretty fianc\u00e9e Ruth (Leila Hyams) who shows up on the island to save him, and in turn to be saved herself, but he's not a great actor. On the other hand, Laughton is. He invests the part with a complex mix of charm, sprawling awkwardly on an operating table to show how fully at ease he is, or smiling with a boyish expression of amusement, not unlike Fatty Arbuckle-but he's also able to exude menace by holding absolutely still, an effect emphasized by shadow, and by saying terrible things with a bland expression. Also remarkable is Kathleen Burke as Lota, the Panther Woman, Moreau's most advanced experiment: she weeps, she loves, she protects her beloved and dies in the effort. The beast-people-Parker and Moreau call them \"natives,\" Parker sincerely and Moreau ironically-are disturbed, and Moreau says \"They are restless tonight.\" Is this the origin of the familiar phrase? When they discover Dr. Moreau is willing to break the law, ordering the death of an intruder, they realize he can die, too, and take him to the House of Pain. Rowing away from the burning island, Dr. Moreau's assistant, the repentant Dr. Montgomery (Arthur Hohl) tells them, \"Don't look back.\" Another source for yet another familiar phrase? The story is not really about political events of the 30s at all--the story was written much earlier--but about the human limits of science, a theme dating back at least to Faustus and Frankenstein.", "I first saw this film in 1933 when I was 7 years old.  My 20 year old aunt, who was also my nanny, used to drag me to these things (also took me to equally horrifying Trader Horn and King Kong) instead of taking me to the playground. Even after 67 years, I remembered the scene when someone was lashing the rebellious half-animals.I checked it out from my video store last year for a re-run.  Absolutely magnificent Laughton. Still scary.", "This chilling adaptation of the H.G.Well's novella, \"The Island of Dr Moreau\" remains unsurpassed, despite two later wretched attempts to improve upon it. Banned in England upon release! An exotic, but sinister atmosphere pervading Moreau's privately-owned island is enhanced by filming in Black & White, whose shadowy contrasts imbue the setting which a dark, suspenseful tone.  Moreau amorally attempts to \"play God\" by creating \"manimals\" - hybrid humans and animals - via surgical vivasection and blood transfusion in his laboratory, The House of Pain. Charles Laughton has never been more campily devilish as when playing Moreau - an exquisite performance by a great actor.Bela Lugosi plays a small, but effective part as \"The Sayer of the Law\": \"Are we not men?\"  Kathleen Burke as the beautiful, erotic \"Panther Woman\" who develops an ill-fated romance with the protagonist, Edward Parker (played by Richard Arlen). Crisp direction by Erle Kenton, with nice make-up effects by Wally Westmore.  The cutaway from the grisly ending when Moreau is about to be subjected to \"surgery of the most fatal kind\" in The House of Pain is most appreciated and is what I consider to be an exercise in directorial restraint and finesse.  My imagination more than filled in the horrific details.  Kudos to Mr. Kenton!", "This controversial adaptation of H.G. Wells' short novel, was outlawed in many nations around the globe due to the unpalatable ethical and religious issues it raised. The film was produced before the infamous Hays Code was set up and thus was able to introduce radical scenes of horror and deviant sexuality that would become taboo until the liberalisation of movies in the early 1970's.Universal were raking in the money and even some critical accolades with their literary monsters series in the 1930's - Dracula, FRANKENSTEIN, THE INVISIBLE MAN - so Paramount threw in the gauntlet and produced the huge box-office hit DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. Buoyed by this massive hit they financed another horror novel and chose THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU (the title was later changed to ISLAND OF LOST SOULS) and Charles Laughton, at the time he was still a relatively new stage actor from England who had previously appeared in THE OLD DARK HOUSE, was cast in the title role. However, the film proved to be a box-office failure and the press mauled it whilst the religious right voiced their anger at the idea that Man could create Man by splicing flesh of various living animals. The possibility of taming animals by grafting humanity into their flesh and the suggestion of bestiality were repugnant to the Church and the film was eventually pulled from release and largely forgotten.The story, about a scientist playing God on an uncharted South Seas Island, was shocking even on the written page but the filmmakers took it one step further and produced a shocker that even H.G. Wells denounced upon seeing the finished film. Charles Laughton, a close friend of H.G. Wells', was an animal lover who was so traumatised by the scenes of vivisection and barbarism that he would never again visit a zoo for the remainder of his life because it made him ill.The passing of time has not dulled the power of the film and the very effective make-up designs remain as fresh and exciting as when they first appeared in 1933. There is no dating here and the film speaks to us across the great divide of decades. For those who have seen the European serial-killer film FUNNY GAMES (1997) they will not forget how the murders took place off-screen and the viewer was only privy to the unbearably horrific sounds of pain. Well, ISLAND OF LOST SOULS employed this technique very effectively back in early 1933. The power of suggestion is more profoundly disturbing than a full visual revelation of the violence.The film moves at a cracking pace and every second of the 71 minutes running time is well utilized, the production values are high and the sets look fabulous, the performances are very good, especially Laughton who resembles a seductive and effeminate Mephistopheles whilst Bela Lugosi, as the Sayer of the Law, is totally convincing in his role as the island elder. His makeup resembles the Wolf-Man and it is impossible to recognise him except through that rich and extravagant voice of his. Lota the Panther Woman, played by the winner of a Paramount publicity audition contest (where over 60,000 hopefuls were tested), is played by Kathleen Burke. Every time she appears the screen sizzles with creamy eroticism. Her body moves like an athletic cat and yet she is very innocent and tender. The moment she uncurls her fingers and reveals her clawed fingers in the moonlight will shrivel the most aroused male member of the audience. The script, although it does deviate from the novel in places, is literate and intelligent. There is a great deal of subtext on display - Laughton dressed in his immaculate white hat and suit and wielding a bull-whip over the animal-natives is a great metaphor for slavery and the invasion of Paradise.Now, as far as I am aware, this film is currently not available either on VHS or DVD for some strange reason. I was very fortunate in tracking down an extremely rare double-bill Laser-Disc which contained the Universal production of MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE on the first platter. This is an interesting combination because we have two separate production houses releasing a double-bill, in this case Paramount and Universal.The transfer of ISLAND OF LOST SOULS is a bit soft and there is print damage in places. However, this very aspect gives the film an edge of authenticity and makes it even more riveting. The print looks like newsreel footage of a real event and this gives the drama added realism. The sound is crisp but does occasionally warble in places. Again, it lends the visual horror a documentary eeriness. The packaging is lovely, a gate-fold sleeve opens up to reveal production photos and a detailed commentary on both films. The disc also features a trailer which contains an alternate angle of a shot in the film but this one is decidedly raunchier!This timeless movie has been neglected for far too long and the time has arrived for it to be remastered for a DVD presentation. Forget the Burt Lancaster and Michael York version from 1977 and the misbegotten 1996 release starring Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. The 1933 film beats them hands down and is right up there with FREAKS (1932) in terms of naked human horror.Highly Recommended.", "The Island of Lost Souls has such a great characterization of Dr. Moreau by Charles Laughton that Laughton was probably extremely lucky his career did not take the turn of Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi. He might have wound up playing all kinds of mad scientists instead of the rich and varied collection of people he did portray. As it was, he returned only once to the horror genre arguably and that was in The Strange Door 18 years later, co-starring with Boris Karloff.As the exiled and disgraced Dr. Moreau, he's discovered a way to speed up the evolutionary process if you accept that all animal life is merely a stepping stone towards mankind. That it involves a particularly brutal form of surgery on them without anesthetic is of no concern to him. He's created his own Devil's Eden in which he is Almighty God.A quarrel with a drunken sea captain strands Richard Arlen on his island which does not have too many visitors except for cargo deliveries of supplies and more animals for experimentation. Laughton decides to make use of Arlen to see if his most perfect creation, Lota the Panther Woman, played by Kathleen Burke has any sexual drives or will he need further experiments.Arlen's fianc\u00e9 Leila Hyams is also looking for him and she arrives on the island setting up a not to be forgotten climax as Laughton's creations discover he's not God after all.Island of Lost Souls, based on an H.G. Wells novel, is entertainment, but it also makes one think about the limits of science and what happens when scientific advances outrace similar advances in mankind's sense of ethics.Anyway, I'm sure Dr. Moreau will not be PETA's man of the year.", "This is the first screen adaptation of the H. G. Wells' novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, and also the best.  It is a bit shocking and one can easily see why the British censors, who were notoriously squeamish where horror films were concerned, did not let it appear in Britain for almost 30 years after its release.  The story is about a man brought to an island where a strange doctor and his medical \"failures\" live.  Charles Laughton plays the god-like doctor who creates and distorts life in his \"House of Pain.\"  Laughton is a marvel to behold with his goatee and his ever-expressive eyes, supplying enough ham to feed an army!  He steals every scene he is in with his menacing demeanor and his subtle yet evocative speech.  The rest of the cast is pretty good, and Bela Lugosi even makes an appearance as the \"Sayer of the Law.\"  The film has some good sets and deals with the issue of man wanting god-like powers rather well.  This is easily one of the best non-Universal horror offerings of the 1930's.  But again the real thrill of the movie is seeing Charles Laughton decked out in white cracking a whip and leering throughout the picture.  His demise also supplies one of the horror screen's most terrifying moments filmed off-stage! Definitely one not to miss!", "After watching HG Wells adaptation of his novel THINGS TO COME it is something of a blessing that he wasn't able to write the screenplay of this version of THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU . It has dated somewhat but at least screenwriters Waldemar Young and Philip Wylie have made a cinematic story that appeals to an audience . There some flaws to the film but at least characters being used as a mouth piece for the author's opinion isn't one of them . It goes without saying Wells hated this movieThe flaws centre around what could and couldn't be shown on film in the 1930s . Bare this in mind and perhaps the most remarkable thng you'll notice how close the screenwriters and director Erle C Kenton sail close to the wind at some points . The subplot of Moreau wanting Edward Parker to mate with a woman who was born a panther does get one's head spinning and it's not disguised in an overly sophisticated way either . Also interesting is how disturbing Moreau's fate is as he screams in the house of pain but no doubt the censors let this pass as he's the villain who has tampered with the fundamentals of nature and The Hays Code stated that in a cinematic film any immorality must be punished on screen . There's a consistency and logic in that case . Moreau has been an exceptional baddie changing the very fundamentals of nature therefore must suffer an exceptional on screen death . Interestingly this film was banned from British cinema until the 1950sThe cast are very good . Richard Arlen as Edward Parker makes for a good hero . He isn't given much character development but he' there to function as a manly matin\u00e9e hunky hero which he does very well . Arlen also has an on screen chemistry with Kathleen Burke as the much hyped \" Panther Woman \" which is just as well because much of the film succeeds or fails with this chemistry . Even the supporting players like Lugosi , Hohl and Hurst make an impression . There is a slight flaw to Laughton's portrayal . Not in his performance but the fact that he seems to have a mustache and beard that has been painted on . It is rather distracting and puzzling since the other make up effects are very goodAll in all this is a fairly impressive film . You have to be slightly forgiving and view it with a 1930s mindset rather a 2010 one but if you do it's a rather impressive film . Even the title sequence has some thought put in to it and one can't help wondering why it isn't better regarded . It could that the 1930s was something of a golden age where horror movies were concerned , or it could be that the subject matter caused it to be banned in some countries until a time when Hammer horror movies with their technicolor blood hit the cinema . Nevertheless it remains a pretty good atmospheric horror", "I have noticed some commenters found the movie boring or slow.  You have to remember that it was made in 1933!  The pacing and suspense probably felt very quick to an audience that had never seen TV, and whose primary source of entertainment was radio (for drama, suspense, horror and comedy).The aspect I find most interesting about this definite classic of the horror genre -- aside from the excellent acting, atmosphere, script (the only adaptation of \"Island of Dr. Moreau\" that is faithful and the only one that's good) and makeup -- is the way it chronicles the development of film, from silent movies to talkies.  Perhaps the reason some viewers find it boring is that one thing the film lacks is any musical soundtrack.  I noticed this quite strikingly in some of the long pans that take place, and also in the chase scenes.  I may be wrong, but I think this is a holdover from silent movies, when the music was supplied by a live musician playing piano in the movie theater.  Certainly some of the emotional reaction shots, and in particular the shots of the group of half-men approaching the camera near the end, which are repeated several times, have the feel of silent movie technique.  In fact, the overall feeling I get when watching this movie is that of a silent movie, with talking added in.  This movie just seems to me to have been made exactly on the cusp of a time when filmmakers were adjusting their techniques to the use of sound, but hadn't fully arrived there yet.Of course the movie is also excellent as pure entertainment.  Charles Laughton was the perfect Dr. Moreau, and all the other players were well done too.  And we all remember the quotes of the Sayer of the Law.  I remember another one, though, by the Captain that brings the girl to the island.  \"No long pig?\" he asks, grinning.  We are chilled to learn that long pig refers to consumption of human flesh.  And the final line, \"Don't look back.\"  Overall, this is a frightening look at the way science can be perverted by people with no conscience.", "The castaway Edward Parker (Richard Arlen) is rescued by a cargo ship that is transporting Mr. Montgomery (Arthur Hohl) and animals to the notorious scientist Dr. Moreau (Charles Laughton), who lives in an isolated tiny island in the South Seas. Edwad sends a message to his fianc\u00e9e Ruth Thomas (Leila Hyams) informing that he is safe and sound and will meet her at Apia. However he has an argument with Captain Davies (Stanley Fields) that tosses him overboard on Dr. Moreau's vessel. The scientist welcomes Edward in his island and offers to transport him on the next day to Apia. Edward sees strange natives and is introduced to the beautiful native Latta (Kathleen Burke). They hear screams from a room called the house of pain by Lotta where Edward sees Dr. Moreau and Montgomery operating a person without anesthetic. But later Montgomery gives a justification to Edward that does not know that Dr. Moreau is performing experiences with animals turning them into people. Further, Dr. Moreau decides to keep Edward in the island since Lolla, who is indeed a panther, is developing human emotions. What will happen to Edward?\"Island of Lost Souls\" is the original version of H. G. Wells' novel \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" to the cinema. The polemic story of an obsessed scientist that decides to play God raised many problems to the producers in UK with the censorship because of the vivisection scenes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"A Ilha das Almas Selvagens\" (\"The Island of the Wild Souls\")", "A true classic in the genre from a long forgotten era, ISLAND OF LOST SOULS surprisingly still holds up today as a fast-moving, intriguing ride through H. G. Wells' horrifying tale of vivisection and animal cruelty. Although two further versions of the novel have been made, neither of them come close to achieving the sheer power and force of this original classic. Surprisingly horrific for the time in scenes of cruelty and torture, the film was banned for years by the squeamish British film censors before they finally came round. Indeed, not many other films from the '30s can be considered so shocking; Moreau's screams as he is picked apart by knives are truly disturbing.The acting in the film is typically good all round, but it is Charles Laughton as the sweating, sadistic villain who stands out from the rest. Whether he's whipping the primitives or gleefully hurting his captives, he is the true embodiment of the dedicated scientist, and I daresay ISLAND OF LOST SOULS is at least partly responsible for the creations-rise-up-and-attack-creator theme we're used to seeing from many, many horror films. An oppressive drum beat on the soundtrack keeps things moving along nicely, and the jungle setting is also put to good use. With Bela Lugosi (Dracula himself) as a native with a big bushy beard and lots of ape-men running through the trees, ISLAND OF LOST SOULS is a marvellous film to watch and a film which others must try and equal themselves with. One of the rightful classics.", "It's a good story, based on one of Wells' best science fiction novels, but ISLAND OF LOST SOULS never has gotten the kudos that it's fellow science fiction and horror tales of the early 1930s got. For all it's flaws, Dracula (Bela Lugosi's version) remains a classic, and the Spanish/Mexican/American version has gotten an increased audience in the last thirty years. FRANKENSTEIN, restoring the cuts, is still powerful, and the sequels (THE BRIDE and THE SON) are also popular. THE INVISIBLE MAN, for all it's dated special effects, still packs a wallop, as does KING KONG. THE MUMMY, THE BLACK CAT - they have not lost their powers to hold interest. Neither has ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, but it seems to get more of a lambasting by critics than the others. Why? My guess is that the very strength of the film is what turns off the critics: Charles Laughton's performance as Dr. Moreau. I happen to find it a fascinating performance of a talented scientist who is driven to madness by his success in a situation where he cannot really reveal it. For Moreau's ability by physical operations (I almost said by grafting) on animals has led to his being ostracized and forced into exile by his peers in Europe, and he is stuck on this island ruling a kingdom of his half-human/half animal followers. His only companion is Montgomery, who turns on him in the movie and Parker and Ms Thomas are just two people who bungle onto the island by accident (as does the ill-fated sea captain). But in the novel, while there is no love interest like Ms Thomas, the state of the human companionship is not so good either.Parker's literary version - Charles Predinck - is a shipwreck survivor too, who is horrified by Moreau's experiments (and almost made part of them). Montgomery is more willing to work with Moreau, but Montgomery is not a very admirable type - he's an alcoholic (which is how he ended up with Moreau), and his lack of common sense leads to his demise.The novel was trying to make a statement about ego-maniacal dictators and their falls from power, which is clearly delineated in the film version. But the end of Moreau is not at the end of the novel. He is killed off by rebellious \"subjects\" earlier, and Montgomery, thinking they won't harm him, proceeds to drink too much and sets himself up for his own gruesome end. Predinck just manages to kill the most dangerous of the animals, and escapes at the end (as Parker and Ms Thomas do in the film with Montgomery).Laughton was one of Hollywood's greatest actors. I can't think of that many character actors who had such a wide variety of successful performances. But Moreau, although in his setting he seems natural, is an over-the-top Laughton performance. I believe that is why the critics are so harsh on him. The threatening shouts about \"the law\" and \"the house of pain\" are repeated and repeated like the mantras they are. But the critics who hear this think of the Laughton who, a year earlier, had overacted as a mad and jealous submarine commander in THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP with Gary Cooper, Tallulah Bankhead, and a youngish Cary Grant. There are similarities, but that film had a pretty weak script (unlike THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS). These critics tend to think of those films made by Laughton before his Oscar winner in THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII as overripe, and tedious - not the expert work of his later career. They fail to notice that he was learning his craft in movies, in these years, and his ranting in parts like Moreau or the submarine commander were necessary to learning the restraint that paints Henry VIII and Captain Bligh and Quasimodo. I find one might not think of the film as highly as the other contemporary films I mentioned earlier, but it is a worthy film nevertheless, and important in Laughton's growth as an actor.", "Charles Laughton is the original Dr. Moreau, the mad scientist who turns wild beasts into something resembling human beings but still containing their animalistic natures. it is up to new arrival Richard Arlen to stop him, messing around with nature in a way no man should have the power to do such. While Arlen is in love with the pretty Leila Hyams, he becomes the target of Panther woman Kathleen Burke. sultry and beautiful, Burke obviously wants to make Arlen her mate, but even in human form she is very catlike and becomes obsessively jealous of Hyams.Then there is Bela Lugosi, playing a small but consequential role as the wise speaker who stands up against Laughton for messing around with nature and obviously offending God. Unrecognizable under a beard covered face, Lugosi gives a sense of his performance that is touching yes field with anger for what Lawton has done to alter their appearances.the tension builds into a horrific finale where time is of the essence for Arlen to get off the island + 4 the transformed animals to finally get their vengeance against Lawton in the most excruciatingly painful way.One of the great science fiction films of the golden age of Hollywood, Island of Lost souls has been remade several times unsuccessfully. The 1977 version attempted to play it straight, but came off as very dated. even the presence of Burt Lancaster of Dr. Moreau couldn't save it from failure. be even worse we make in the 1990s with Marlon Brando as Dr. Moreau is considered a disaster in every sense of the word. it resembles a cartoon more than a reflection of its original HG Wells story, and it is obvious to me that the story needs to be left alone. Obviously, Hollywood knew how to make these types of films in the 1930s but they appear majorly dated or melodramatic when recreated today.An excellent performance by Charles Laughton in the very same year he won an Oscar for playing Henry the 8this a strong leading character and certainly much more memorable then the unfortunate remix with Lancaster and Brando. Latin could be happy but here, he tones it down when he needs to and brings it up for the more complex moments of his character development. As for Kathleen Burke, she makes a lovely sight as the Panther woman, even wearing Panther's skin as human clothing. barely saying a word, Burke makes the feline aspects of her character obvious, doing more with less then the actors who played this part in the remakes.", "Despite the fact that all subsequent remakes have garnered AWFUL reviews, this \"granddaddy\" of all Island of Dr. Moreau/ Island of Lost Souls film is a wonderful thriller. It's genuinely creepy and chilling--probably one of the scariest films of the era (aside from FREAKS). I think one of the reason this film succeeds while follow-ups have not is that it is filmed in mega-creepy black and white AND because the movie isn't bogged down with special effects or bloated, over-paid actors. In fact, its the simplicity of this film that make it work. Charles Laughton as the evil doctor and Bela Lugosi as the Sayer of the Law are terrific.", "Sailor Edward Parker (a solid and likable performance by Richard Arlen) finds himself stranded on a remote island in the tropics. He discovers that ruthless and unscrupulous mad scientist Dr. Moreau (splendidly played with suavely slimy menace by Charles Laughton) has been conducting horrible and unethical experiments that transform animals into pitiful subhuman beasts.Director Erle C. Kenton keeps the twisted and absorbing story moving along at a brisk pace, does an expert job of crafting a spooky and unsettling atmosphere, and stages the thrilling climax with gusto. The fine acting by the excellent cast holds this picture together: Bela Lugosi excels in his small, yet memorable role as the Sayer of the Law, Kathleen Burke projects both a sweet naivete and smoldering animal sensuality as alluring panther woman Lota, Arthur Hohl lends sterling support as Moreau's disgraced, yet conscience-stricken assistant Montgomery, Tetsu Komai elicits sympathy as timid and loyal servant M'ling, and Hans Steinke cuts an imposing and frightening figure as the hulking Ouran. The gutsy script by Philip Wylie and Waldemar Young tackles such bold themes as bestiality, vivisection, miscegenation (Moreau encourages Lota to seduce Parker), and the intrinsic evil and cruelty of man playing at being God head on. Moreover, the marked emphasis on pain (the anguished shrieks and screams made by the beastmen are positively bloodcurdling), torture, and sadism give this film an extra unnerving edge, with the haughty and merciless Moreau in particular rating as a truly fearsome piece of nasty work. Kudos are also in order for Wally Westmore's imaginatively grotesque make-up and the sumptuous black and white cinematography by Karl Struss. Highly recommended.", "Together with Tod Browning's \"Freaks\" and Karl Freund's \"Mad Love\", this \"Island of Lost Souls\" is probably the oldest movie that is still truly petrifying by today's standards. Because, let's be honest, classic landmarks like Universal's \"Dracula\" or \"Frankenstein\" are brilliantly nostalgic and atmospheric, but the subject matter of these movies is not as genuinely unsettling and nightmarish as what is going on in Erle C. Kenton's infamous adaptation of the legendary H.G. Wells story. The author may perhaps not have appreciated the film-version of his novel at the time, but I secretly like to think that \u2013 if he would still be alive today \u2013 he would definitely reckon the powerful impact of the film by now (especially with all the other crap that came out later with his name attached to it). After \"The Hunchback of the Notre Dame\", this is the second mesmerizing Charles Laughton performance that I've watched in just two weeks' time. He is brilliantly repellent as the callous & eccentric scientist Dr. Moreau, obsessed with altering the evolution theory and messing with nature's beautiful creatures. Well hidden on his little jungle island, Dr. Moreau attempts to turn animals into human beings and submits them to excruciating experiments in his aptly named \"House of Pain\". His work isn't fully successful yet, as his creations are fierce and hideous human beasts that live all across the island. In order to keep them under his control, Moreau rules his island like a tyrant with a whip and put together \"The Law\". When castaway Edward Parker unwillingly strands on the island, Dr. Moreau is immediately intrigued by the possible emotions he would evoke with his only female guinea pig. \"Island of Lost Souls\" \u2013 undeniably the most sophisticated version of the tale \u2013 is particularly a success thanks to the atmospheric location and director Kenton's masterful use of sounds & lights. Dr. Moreau's island comes across as hellish and the absolute last place on earth you want to wash ashore. It's a nearly impenetrable jungle of dark shadows and continuous screams, where hairy monsters are staring at you from within the bushes and deformed souls painfully howl. The film obviously doesn't feature a lot of special effects, but the simplistic make-up on the already natural born flamboyant actors works very effectively. One of them, deeply hidden under copious amounts of facial hair, is Bela Lugosi as the spokesperson of the jungle community. And, oh yes, Kathleen Burke is strangely enticing as the mysterious Panther Woman. Pure Sci- Fi/horror greatness!", "This is an eerie, strange movie that has since been re-made several times, most notably in 1996 with \"The Island Of Dr. Moreau.\" I liked the latter better than this, mainly because of great color and, of course, much better special-effects. You would expect that for a film made 60 years after this one! However, this isn't bad. They still did a nice job on the special-effects, in fact better-than-good considering it's the early '30s.Charles Laughton plays the famous \"Dr. Moreau,\" a man who almost makes humans out of animals. It was interesting to see Bela Lugosi, too, in a role other than \"Dracula,\" and a role in which he sounds like a quite proper Englishman!This movie holds up well but I would still take the '96 re-make over it. Best of all would be to own both movies.", "Welcome to the House of Pain..... Are We Not Men?Considering that this somewhat freaky Fantasy/Mad Scientist picture is now 82 years old, I'd say that it actually holds up quite well as far as entertainment goes, especially when you take into account all of films in this genre that have followed it in these many years since its 1932 release.Set on a small, uncharted island in the South Pacific, Island Of Lost Souls' story is quite effective horror that tells the tale of one man playing god (the sadistic & sinister, Dr. Moreau) who blindly tampers with the reconstruction of evolution within the animal kingdom.Based on H.G. Wells' novel of the same name, Island Of Lost Souls is, indeed, an atmospheric tale that contains some strange moments of odd-looking creatures seen lurking within the the shadows & darkness.With its short running time of only 70 minutes, this picture features some truly impressive make-up effects that certainly helped to highlight all of the drama.Needless to say, Island Of Lost Souls' inevitable climax was a very fitting one where the wicked, whip-cracking Dr. Moreau was finally given \"a taste of his own medicine\", in the truest sense of those words.", "Just watched this, the first filmed version of H. G. Wells' \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" called Island of Lost Souls. It stars Charles Laughton as the lead character who loves performing experiments making animals into humans. It seems Edward Parker (Richard Arlen) gets thrown overboard to his island when the drunken Captain Davies (Stanley Fields) forces him to the \"nearby port\". There, he meets an exotic woman named Lota (Kathleen Burke) and the doctor's assistant, Mr. Montgomery (Arthur Hohl), before seeing the gentlemanly, if crafty, Moreau himself. Meanwhile, his finance Ruth Thomas (Leila Hyams), with the help of Captain Donahue (Paul Hurst), looks for Ed...I have to admit first out that I didn't find this very scary until the final 10 minutes and some of the dialogue is kinda bland and the lack of a music score (except for the beginning and ending credits) doesn't help. Still, Laughton brings a subtle chill every time he speaks and his later scenes with Bela Lugosi as Sayer of the Law are still pretty effective today especially when the latter keeps saying, \"Are we not men?\" So that's something to look forward to. But having said all that, Erle C. Kenton provides fine touches in many night scenes and the makeup of the creatures are fascinating in a theatrical way. And Ms. Burke, as Lota, does provide a little sexy presence with Ms. Hyams, as Ruth, some class. (By the way, Kathleen Burke spent the rest of her life in Chicago, Ill., my birthtown, where she previously was a dental assistant.) So on that note, Island of Lost Souls is worth a look.", "The basic plot:Edward Parker is picked up by a ship, and then thrown off by a drunk captain along with the ships cargo,the cargo being a ship of animals. The cargo arrives at an uncharted island with strange natives . He makes the acquaintance of Dr. Moreau , who turns animals into the natives which we see .....The praise: Actually very creepy ,intelligent and entertaining .Charles Laughton gives an excellent, silky performance as Dr. Moreau, the perfect villain . All of it is perfect entertainment, and all of the scenes in the woods are still frightening, including the superb \" What is the law?\" sequence. Bela also turns in a fine performance as the keeper of the law. Creepy, simple makeup. All finely staged, structured , with a terrific script . The intelligent subtext about the line between man and beast and disturbing order is still interesting.Top-notch lighting, design, atmosphere and art direction. a must-see, and an all time great.The flaws: Comic relief and the romantic couple date it somewhat.Note: It's ironic that Paramounts 4 Horror movies( this, Dr. J and Mr. H, Murders in Zoo, and Murder by the clock) are darker than universals horror movies of that period, for Paramount wa known as a light entertainment company.", "After Universal scored such hits with 'Dracula' and 'Frankenstein' in 1931, it was clear that horrifying audiences was big business. Amongst the steady stream of cinematic terrors that followed, a year later Paramount brought us swathes of monstrosities courtesy of HG Wells and his insane Doctor Moreau.The make-up for the 'lost souls' is very impressive on the more subtle mutations, but less so on the more 'advanced' experiments. Which brings us to the most vocal, The Sayer of the Law, played by Bela 'Dracula' Lugosi (as he is billed, just above 'The Panther Woman'). Covered in fur, this is the actor that, a year earlier, had supposedly turned down the Frankenstein Monster for fear the make-up would obscure his matin\u00e9e looks (which is given as one of a number of reasons he didn't end up playing the role despite being touted for it). The Sayer of the Law would seem to debunk that particular theory.Lota, the Panther Woman herself, is played very appealingly by Kathleen Burke in an outfit that exposes a lot of flesh for the time. Her growing relationship with Richard Arlen as Parker \u2013 a hero not quite as overshadowed by the other characters as is usual in horror films from this era \u2013 is interesting, but causes problems when his girl Ruth (Leila Hyams) travels all the way to the remote island to look for him.Finally, what an actor Charles Laughton was. Whilst time has rendered the performances of some of the actors around him dated and theatrical, Laughton's Moreau is every bit as convincing and villainous in 2017 as he was 85 years ago. Superbly spoken but dripping with malice, or uncontrolled and snarling like one of his own animalistic experiments, he is compelling at all times. Moreau's ultimate fate is one of the most unpleasant you could imagine, but horribly satisfying too.This is a mighty slice of grim and effective cinema. We could smile at some of the quaint make-up effects of course, but Director Erle C Kenton is at his creative peak here. He would go on to direct future Universal horrors, but never does he imbue them with the sense of unease and danger as is on show here. Strange, leering faces loom of out the jungle, misshapen shapes move in the shadows, revealing deformed limbs \u2013 or in one case, a solitary hoof \u2013 although we are fairly sure that their animalistic fury is directed only at those responsible for their current predicaments.After all, 'are we not men?'", "Exceedingly grisly for its day, and still pretty frightening, the movie is an adaptation of the H.G. Wells novel The Island Of Dr. Moreau, about a mad scientist who experiments with evolution in his island laboratory, leading to shocking results, half-human half-beast creatures for whose predicament the term identity crisis would be a gigantic understatement. Their lives are hell, as Laughton's sadistic treatment of them makes their existence sheer pain.Filmed like a horror movie, which is how it's often classified, the film is more like a precursor of the nature-gone-wild science fiction pictures of the fifties, minus the usual military heroics. It also, thanks to Wells, has the courage of its convictions, and the pessimistic implications of its ideas are not glossed over or simplified in the least. Science, in other words, is not used as an excuse for showing us horror but is rather,--and there's no beating around the bush here--the cause of it.It is a very dark and gloomy film, and it is impossible for any intelligent person not to ponder the year of its release, 1933, as the reason for this as much as the story itself. This was the year Hitler came to power in Germany; also, Franklin Roosevelt in the U.S. We knew what Hitler was about, or at least his ideas, while FDR was still an unknown quantity. The Depression was at its worst, and millions were unemployed and starving. Without going too far out on a limb it is easy enough to see the lost, tortured souls in the film as victims of the Depression. They are men twisted out of shape by those in power,--like the wicked, white-suited Dr. Moreau--and their future looks grim, their prospects few. \"Is this what the world is coming to?\", the movie seems to ask. In 1933 it was hard to come up with a glibly optimistic reply. As one of the leaders of the beastly mob asks at one point, \"Are We Not Men?\". This was a question that at the time had no easy answer. That it had to be raised in the first place is as frightening to contemplate as anything we have actually seen.", "Based on the novel by the great H.G. Wells, this classic film adaptation of The Island of Dr Moreau delivers as both a source of intrigue and a horrifying horror movie. Perhaps not as great as Val Lewton's horror classics, or the films that Ernest B. Schoedsack made for RKO in the early thirties, Island of Lost Souls still stands out as one of the decade's very best horror films. Unfortunately, this film hasn't got a good commercial DVD release anywhere in the world, and this meant I had to see it on a rather poor bootleg; but true greatness still shines through, and even in poor quality; Erle C. Kenton's film is still a shocking and well produced little film. The plot follows a young man who gets lost at sea. He wakes up on a distant island that seems to be ruled by a white-clad doctor calling himself Dr Moreau. The locals aren't quite normal in this place, and it soon transpires that the doctor's experiments into evolution have gone too far; as the people on the island are a result of the not so good doctor's experiments, over which he now rules as a God...The standout performance of the entire film expectedly comes from Charles Laughton in the lead role. Laughton looks eerie in his purely white outfit, and his lines of dialogue ensure that the character always appears as the maniac that his experiments suggest him to be. Richard Arlen doesn't standout next to Laughton, but his acting is good; and the cast is rounded off by great supporting performances from the always welcome Bela Lugosi and Kathleen Burke in the role of the panther woman. One of the principle reasons why this film works so well is the way that director Erle C. Kenton creates the atmosphere. The island setting provides a perfect location for a film like this, as the action always feels isolated and this helps to give the film a surreal, otherworldly feel. The special effects aren't the best, but the way that the director handles the film overall means that they fit and a good job is made of the fact that most of the characters are indeed 'freaks'. The film doesn't last for long, and the director ensures that every second counts as a good story is told in the time that we have, and it all boils down to a fitting, chilling and somewhat shocking conclusion! Overall, Island of Lost Souls comes highly recommended to fans of classic horror!"], "tt0024216": ["Pretty much sums up the movie, doesn't it? Who hasn't heard of King Kong? This movie is a major part of my childhood, it's one of the first horror films that I ever saw and I couldn't get enough of that giant ape. My mom always laughed at me because this is the first movie that made me cry, I rooted for King Kong all the way, all he wanted was that hot little blonde and to fight dinosaurs. Not too much to ask for. But why is King Kong so great? Why is it still very memorable? Besides the story that was incredibly interesting, the effects are absolutely amazing for it's time. When I was a kid, I seriously thought that they found a giant ape to star in the movie, give me a little credit, you believe anything at 4 years old. But this was the first movie to have tiny figures brought to life on film that were made to look like they were 80 feet tall. King Kong is character of it's own and this film is absolutely wonderful.Carl Denham, a film director who is famous for shooting animal pictures in remote and exotic locations, is unable to hire an actress to star in his newest project and so wanders the streets searching for a suitable girl. He chances upon unemployed Ann Darrow, as she is caught trying to steal an apple. Denham pays off the grocer then buys Ann a meal and offers her the lead role in his latest installment. Although Ann is apprehensive, she has nothing to lose and eagerly agrees. They set sail aboard the Venture, an old tramp steamer that travels for weeks in the direction of Indonesia, where Denham claims they will be shooting. Despite his ongoing declarations that women have no place on board ships, the ship's first mate Jack Driscoll is obviously becoming attracted to Ann. Denham then describes something monstrous connected to the island he's sailing too, a legendary entity known to the islanders as \"Kong\". Finally arriving at the island's shore, they see a native village perched on a peninsula, cut off from the bulk of the island by an enormous wall. A landing party, including the filmmaker and his leading lady, goes ashore and encounters the natives, who are about to hand over a girl to Kong as a ritual sacrifice. Although Denham, Englehorn, Jack and Ann are hiding behind foliage, the native chief spots them and approaches the troop. Captain Englehorn is able to understand the native speech, and at Denham's urging makes friendly overtures to the chief. When he gets a clear look at Ann, the chief begins speaking with great energy. Englehorn translates this as \"look at the golden woman!\" The chief proposes to swap six native women for Ann, an offer Denham delicately declines as he and his party edge away from the scene, assuring the chief that they will return tomorrow to get better acquainted. Back on the Venture, Jack and Ann openly express their love for each another. When Jack is called away to the captain's quarters, a stealthy contingent of natives captures Ann, takes her back to the wall and presents her to Kong in an elaborate ceremony. Kong emerges from the jungle and is revealed to be a giant gorilla. The Venture crew returns to the village and takes control of the wall; half of the crew then go after Kong.King Kong was a first of a kind horror movie, it had a story, terrific actors, amazing effects and a wonderful script. Faye Ray was the first actress I really looked up too as a kid, she was absolutely beautiful and such a great screamer, she made me want to lay in a monkey's paw for a while\u0085 yes, I also needed to get out more as a child. But hey, you have to admit, if you ever wake up late for work, I'd rather take a giant ape then the bus or car to be caught in rush hour. Anyways, is this movie worth the look? Absolutely, it's a true classic that I guarantee you'll love. It's a great movie and still stands the test of time of making us believe that there are giant apes in third world countries.10/10", "How many films can truly be said to be definitive? The answer is probably \"not many\", but the original 1933 version of King Kong is certainly one of them. For its time, every aspect is innovative. First-of-their-kind special effects, first-of-its-kind plot, famous performances and a final sequence that remains unequalled as an eye-popping cinematic experience. The quality of cinematography and visual trickery has progressed a long way since 1933 - so the special effects obviously look rather primitive to 21st Century eyes - but anyone with a shred of common sense will still be astounded by what they see. This is movie history in the making. Had this never been made, the whole history of films may have taken a different course.Ace film director Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) hires an unemployed, attractive New York woman Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to star in his new picture. He takes her by boat to remote Skull Island where, according to legend, there lives an awesome god-like beast named Kong. Denham's plan is to shoot a variation of the Beauty and the Beast story, using Ann as his beauty and Kong as his beast. Everyone involved gets more than they bargained for when Ann is kidnapped by the island natives and offered as a sacrifice to Kong. She is kidnapped by a gigantic prehistoric ape and saved only by the courage of ship's mate Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot). But Denham has one more trick up his sleeve when he captures Kong and takes the beast back to New York. You don't really think those chains will hold him, do you?Virtually every monster movie ever made owes something to King Kong - even colossal modern hits like Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Godzilla (not to mention thousands of small scale homages such as The Land Unknown and Gorgo). It is arguably the most influential film of all-time. I genuinely envy people who were lucky enough to experience this film during its 1933 opening week - what must they have thought? Did they realize they were witnessing something utterly extraordinary? I could go on all day giving reasons why you should see it, but it would be pointless. It can all be summed up in one sentence: if you have even the slightest interest in movies SEE THIS FILM!", "First, the 1933 version of KING KONG, is for me, the greatest fantasy film ever made.  Sure, there are fantasy films with far better special effects (THE MATRIX, JURASSIC PARK) better acting (the acting here is of the period!) but KING KONG is a film of tremendous excitement.  The suspense, pacing, sensuality, violence all adds up to a blood pumping experience.  We all read about the film's history, being made, released, censored, restored, and how it's been picked to itsy-bits by every arm-chair film \"expert\".What very few film-makers have focused on is the film-making itself in KING KONG.  It has superb build-up.  We are wondering what is on the island as we approach it.  Then we wonder what is behind the wall on the island. Then we wonder what gigantic beast is sharing that frightening jungle with the rescuers, trying to save Fay Wray.  The film is faultlessly edited.  Many scenes begin or end with people running for their lives.  Unneeded scenes just don't exsist (we go from Kong knocked out on Skull Island to his Broadway debut.  We don't need to see what happens inbetween!) then there's Max Steiner's perfect music score.  Before KONG, most music scores were borrowed snippets of classical or popular themes, but Steiner's score follows the action to an inch!  Also, he does a great number of abstract musical strokes (I.e the clash of drums when Kong beats the giant snake to it's death.  The lovely string piece that jumps to pulsating chase music in a milli-second.)  When I hear of a friend say they never saw this film, it's like hearing a child say they never had ice cream.  Long Live Kong!", "But the hard cold fact is that while the inevitable remakes have come and gone, this black and white, pre-CGI original remains one of the greatest films of its kind and even today has a better chance of mesmerizing an audience OF ANY AGE than any of the slam-bang thank-you-mam pyrotechnics that pass for quality entertainment in our era. THE SETUP IS ASTONISHING. Talk about your cinematic foreplay! Before any actor in this film ever sets foot on Skull Island, the audience is totally creeped out by the mists, the tall tales, the rumours, the strange goings-on shipboard... by the time we actually see Kong, it is almost anti-climactic. And this was the first film to fully develop the idea of transposing the \"beauty and the beast\" story to modern horror. What does that ape see in Fay Wray? What does she see in him? That 10,000 cartoonists have redone the final \"skyscaper\" sequence gives new meaning to \"iconic.\" Un-equalled. ((Designated \"IMDb Top Reviewer.\" Please check out my list \"167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))", "With the recent DVD release of this film, and the latest version on the big screen being released two days from this writing, I hope more people take the opportunity to check this movie out, the original King Kong, if they've never seen it.This movie must have been astounding to the people watching it over 70 years ago. I doubt they'd ever seen anything like this, action-wise, and monster-wise. It is still fascinating today, even with the great advancements in special effects.Most action films from the classic years, from 1920 to the late 1960s had corny mostly unrealistic special effects but this film still holds up, extraordinarily so considering its age. The film also had a tremendous amount of action. Young people today are usually bored watching old black-and-white movies but they wouldn't be bored with this one. Once the \"girl,\" Fay Wray gets captured by King Kong, the rest of the movie is one long action scene.Kong was not the only beast in the movie, either, which surprised me the first time I ever saw this. Protecting Wray, Kong battles a dinosaur, a giant snake, a giant bird and then human beings firing bullets and bombs at him.Wray also was fun to watch, but I''m a male so a pretty woman like her - shockingly exposing her breasts in one scene, too - makes it easier to enjoy the film. Her screaming, however, can get on your nerves. She must have been hoarse for a month after filming this movie.Robert Armstrong, as the film director, and Bruce Cabot, as the ship crewman and Wray''s rescuer, also are interesting to watch and hear. As I said, once the action kicks in, the his a very entertaining movie and impossible to put down.", "I first saw this in a theatre in the early 80s when it rereleased.Then again many times on vhs.Revisited it recently with my 7 year old nephew since he is on monster verse marathon. Revisited the restored version which is basically 104 mins of which 4 mins is an overture.Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but lemme contribute a lil more by praising how good this film is.Willis O'Brien's stop-motion effects are the best part about this film.Its sad that the pit scene is lost forever.Peter Jackson gave homage to O'Brien by creating the pit scene which is available on YouTube.The fight between Kong n Tyrannosaurus is amazeballs. It looked as if two fellas are having a wrestling match. Even the way Kong checks his opponent's heads after defeating them to make sure they are dead is superbly done.The film is action packed n filled with lottuva creatures.Kong battles a Tyrannosaurus, an Elasmosaurus (which looked like a giant anaconda), a Pteranodon and lots of bullets and bombs.We also have a Brontosaurus n a Stegosaurus wreaking havoc on humans.My respect goes to Merian C. Cooper, Ernest B. Schoedsack n O'Brien.", "Special effects may have improved..... But this is still the best version. It stands alone. And hard to believe in a couple of years-this film will be 90 years old! (writing this in 2019).\nFay Wray still the best screamer. I have enjoyed this film since I first saw it in the 1960's. A true classic.", "I never got around to reviewing \"King Kong\" because it already has a bazillion reviews and is ranked in IMDb's Top 250. In other words, what could I possibly add to the other excellent reviews? Well, not much, probably! However, I am at least unique in that I saw the film in the theater as well as tonight on Turner Classic Movies. No, I did NOT see it back in 1933 (I'm not THAT old) but when it was re-released in 1971. At the time, I loved the film and thought it brilliant entertainment. So, tonight with my youngest (who is a huge classic horror fan), I watched the film once again and had a ball. I also marveled at the wonderful special effects for 1933. Sure, some of it may look quaint today (especially the stop-motion Kong), but considering that there had been nothing like it before, you can't help but admire it. However, one aspect of the project really stands up superbly today--and is every bit as nice as the newer versions--that's the cinematography. The wonderful scenes in the jungle are marvelous works of black & white art--almost like Ansel Adams' work if he'd used a movie camera. I loved the misty backgrounds, exquisite use of matte paintings and mostly seamless integration of props, people and backgrounds. This truly is one of the most important and ground-breaking films in history and must be seen in its context to be appreciated.By the way, the same year RKO released this film they rushed \"Son of Kong\" into theaters to cash in on the public's reaction to the first movie. Unfortunately, while it's watchable and clever at the beginning, the film degenerates to a sappy kids' movie later on and is an easy film to skip. Too bad....I wanted to love the sequel as much as the original.", "KING KONG, the mother of all monster movies, is truly a masterpiece of cinema. Sure, it's dated, shot in black and white and featuring a monster made of plasticine who's a lot less believable than the CGI creation in the Peter Jackson 2005 remake, and yet this 1933 original is by far the better film. Why? The reason is that it has everything you could want from cinema: a love story, plenty of adventure, horror, excitement and tragedy. Literally nothing is missed out here, and despite his best efforts Jackson doesn't even come close.In my mind, KING KONG is the first of the blockbuster movies that later became a Hollywood mainstay. The story is truly larger than life and the whiff of the exotic runs through it from beginning to end. Even without Kong, it's a great film, with decent actors giving decent performances and bringing their characters to life. Fay Wray headlines, of course, in the process becoming the most famous scream queen of all time.Kong is inevitably the main attraction and he's a delight. Willis O'Brien's stop-motion is well ahead of its time, and he fills his creation with real character and emotion - not bad when you're working with a lump of clay. The dinosaur fights are great fun, but the real brilliance comes during the city-wide chaos at the climax, which ended up inspiring a whole global genre of destructive monster-fuelled mayhem. And I'm not ashamed to say I still shed a tear during that ending. It's fair to say that both remakes are entirely redundant and pale in comparison to this masterful original.", "This movie is pure entertainment from opening to finish. I have seen this movie probably more than any other in my 57 years. Every time it's on I find myself just thinking I'll watch for a few minutes, then find myself absolutely mesmerized. I have never had the desire to be an actress but I can't help but think that Fay Wray must have had an absolute blast playing this part and I would have chosen this role over any other. Special effects are still amazing after all these years. The emotion you feel for Kong is real and poignant. A must see for everyone.", "So much has been written about this movie, which has been analyzed more than all but a few films, it's difficult to come up with anything new to say about it but to say that it's magnificently made, and dated as it is in certain respects, it plays as well as anything from seventy years ago, and has a dream logic of its own, which, if one submits to it, still works its charms.A few points:i.) There are no wholly sympathetic characters in the movie. While some people are more likable than others, there's really no one to identify with. Fantastic as the subject matter is, it's filmed almost like a documentary about an adventurer who captures a giant ape, takes it to New York, where it escapes, wreaks havoc in the city, takes down the el as if it were toy, and stomps on a lot of innocent people.ii.) I've never heard more screaming in a movie than in this one. Men, women, children, natives, sailors, white people, dark people, you name it, they scream, often and loudly. Fay Wray is the chief screamer here, but there are plenty of others, such as the man chased up a tree by a dinosaur, and the sailors shaken off the log by Kong, as they fall to a horrifying death in the ravine. When Kong attacks the village there's screaming galore, then more screaming in old Manhattan, when the big guy breaks out of the theater. For his part, Kong does not scream. He roars. The great ape is angry, not terrified, while the people are only afraid.iii.) As one of the chief characters is a documentary film-maker, it's impossible (for me anyway) to avoid making associations between what is going on in the film and the film-making process itself, as I wonder to what extent this entered into the minds of them men who made the movie, Merian Cooper and Ernest Shoedsack. To put it another way, film-maker Carl Denham wants to film the beast to show movie audiences something weird and exotic, so as to tickle their fancy. What he finds is so fantastic that he scraps the idea of making a movie and brings the creature back to civilization and puts it on display. But the beast has fallen in love with a woman, and when he thinks press photographers are hurting her, breaks free from his chains and goes on a rampage through Manhattan. Real life, which was supposed to make a \"swell movie\", proved so astonishing that it had to be brought back alive, to be shown to people as something that actually exists (i.e. not a thing made up by movie men), but in the process something went wrong, and the great creature went berserk. King Kong is in other words about a movie that didn't get made because life interfered, and proved more fantastic than the film that was abandoned. As such one might call it a cautionary tale (movie men, stick to your job). Or is it about the movies themselves? How, in their attempt to bottle life and sell it back to moviegoers as entertainment, like Kong, they have a way of breaking free and becoming real all over again.", "KING KONG is more than a mere monster movie. Even though I love the stop-motion by Willis O'Brien, the adventure on Skull island, and the eventual New York City rampage, there's more going on than special effects and thrills.KING KONG tells several tales, including the primal \"man vs. beast\", the environmental \"man's exploitation of the natural world\", and the forbidden love story between Kong and Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), where the creature's ferocity is offset by his gentle protectiveness toward her.The fact that O'Brien was able to animate a tiny model and not only make it appear huge, but also make it a living, sympathetic character in the film, is a tribute to his creative ability. Within it's glued-on rabbit fur, beats a living heart. This is a morality tale that causes self examination. So many decades after its original release, I still cry every damn time he climbs the Empire State Building!...", "So much more than a film about a giant ape, you can pretty much conjure him into almost any allegorical theme or representation that takes your fancy, although I'm not sure that was the original intent. The scenes on the Empire State Building are as iconic as any that were ever produced, perhaps the most iconic ever. A timeless classic, a timeless story that will continue to be copied in variation, and remade, but seldom equalled.", "It's a shame that young people these days, don't know how to enjoy a black & white movie! I'm 14, and I love black & white movies. We saw this movie at school, and everyone hated it. They said it sucked, because it was in black & white, and the effects were hilariously bad!I disagreed!This movie is nearly 80 years old, and it's still a hit!The cinematography is incredibly beautiful. One of the greatest shots of all time is when Kong is on the top of the building!The acting is fine.The story is great, but my friends found it stupid. They thought it was unrealistic because there were dinosaurs and a giant gorilla on the island etc.This movie is entertaining throughout the whole movie! Most black & whites movies got a lot of dialog and long scenes with no editing, but not in this one! There are plenty of scenes in this movie where there are no dialog, but great editing and entertainment!The effects are so fantastic! Young people may find Kong hilarious when they see a close-up picture of him. But I was absolutely blown away! Imagine that you're in 1933. You go to the movies and you've never seen something like this before!King Kong is a one small step for man. One giant leap for film making!10/10", "Famed movie producer Carl Denham is about to embark on his latest project. He has his ship chartered, his crew assembled and his leading lady hired. The location: an uncharted island off Sumatra. The main star of his film: a huge gorilla, King Kong.The original King Kong, and best. Good plot, with a solid set up, a fair degree of intrigue and exciting developments. Good adventure and action along the way.Some good sub-plots and character development too.Probably the most outstanding area of this movie is the quality of the special effects. Yes, by today's CGI standards the special effects are pretty basic but by 1933's standards they must have been revolutionary. Even today, when we're used to seamless CGI, many of the effects in this movie, especially the huge gorilla and dinosaurs, look pretty life-like.And these special effects contribute some of the most iconic images in film history, not least of which is the famous scene with King Kong on the Empire State Building, swatting at fighter planes.A seminal movie in the history of cinema.", "\"He was a king and a god in the world he knew, but now he comes to civilisation merely a captive, a show to gratify your curiosity,\" the director says to the vaudeville house, before a curtain goes up and we see Kong suspended with his arms nailed out, as if on a cross.Self-reflection and satire of Hollywood is everywhere, which came as a great shock to me. There is a great subtext: the story is about a filmmaker who travels to overseas locations, such as jungles, to film his movies - he cares nothing for the cultures he may be violating, all he cares is capturing the spectacle on film. If he is unable to capture it on film, he tells us early on in the picture, he'll destroy it without a second thought. This is a film about the emptiness and recklessness of Hollywood, yet the satire is not bitter, but tongue-in-cheek in a way that follows James Whale's advice for putting subtexts in genre films, ie, not spoiling it for those viewers who don't \"get the joke.\" So Kong can be enjoyed as a pure genre picture. The performances have false moments, but as an adventure picture it develops well, taking us gradually further towards the mystery of the legend of Kong, then follows Kong as the whole drama of his attempted capture plays out. The music also, is great, and along with mist and good cinematography helps create a mysterious atmosphere. The beginning is fairly talky, but it picks up. And the lovely Fay Wray offers reason enough to watch this on her own. If I was Kong, i know i'd beat the hell out of any dinosaur there was in order to protect her!Luckily, King Kong came in the period between 1930 and 1934 when there was no production code in Hollywood, so content was not censored. A couple years later we wouldn't have had the pleasure of seeing Fay Wray clad in a torn to shreds jungle jane costume, and especially not then falling in the water wearing said outfit! And probably not the degree of violence we have here: in one particular fight Kong has with T-rex he breaks the dinosaur's head by pulling its jaws so far open!The vintage special effects are great. They're so fun for quaintness value, but in places they're actually really good. The wrestling match with the T-rex, when Kong cracks a giant snake's back, and especially when he shakes the men off the log - all these sequences in particular were very well done. When I think about it, these effects aren't as quaint next to today's as you might initially think. How would we do a convincing giant ape onscreen (how will Peter Jackson do it in 2005)? By computer? Most of our completely computerised creatures at this writing are ridiculously fake looking. Try the ridiculous creature in Hulk? Everyone commented on how fake it looked. I'll go for the much more fun stop-motion Hickenlooper Kong over Hulk anyday.And the famous climax in New York City, which ends on the Empire State Building with Kong swatting at planes, is marvellous.", "I watched this a couple of days after Peter Jackson's KING KONG hit the cinemas . I had planned to go to the cinema to see the new version but just found out that it lasted for three hours which is far too long for someone who's addicted to caffeine and nicotine . I much prefer watching a movie with a cup of tea in one hand and a filthy cigarette in the other . Which reminds me that my new year resolution is to give up smoking . Sorry I digressPerhaps the other thing stopping me is a fear of disappointment . I do confess I was disappointed after seeing THE TWO TOWERS at the cinema probably because I loved FELLOWSHIP so much , a film I didn't really expect much from . You see the original KING KONG is regarded as possibly the greatest monster movie ever made and after seeing it again I can see where it got its reputation from . This is a great Hollywood epicOne thing you must do however is ignore the failings of special effects from a modern day perspective . Yes we know that the title monster is a giant puppet , yes we know those dinosaurs are bloody laughable but that's not what you should be looking at . What makes the movie so enjoyable is the strength of the storytelling , the emotional depth and most important of all the imagination involved , it has a true sense of scale and wonder . I really hated the 1976 remake simply because it featured no giant reptiles on Skull Island ( Though there's other reasons to hate the dire remake too ) and you might bite your lip to stop yourself laughing as the expedition are attacked by a whole host of prehistoric monsters but you've got to admit it's very , very enjoyable as are the scenes in New York at the end", "In 1933, the bold and successful filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) travels by ship with a large crew, his friend Jack Driscoll and the starlet Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) to an unknown island to shoot a movie. The local natives worship a huge gorilla called Kong and they abduct Ann to offer her in a sacrifice to Kong. Jack Driscoll, who is in love with her, Carl Denham, who aims to capture the animal for an exhibition in New York and part of the crew hike into the jungle, where dinosaurs live, trying to rescue Ann. King Kong falls in love for Ann and protects her against the dangers. But the gorilla is captured and brought to New York. In the middle of a show in Broadway, King Kong escapes, bringing panic to the Apple city.Two days ago I saw Peter Jackson's unnecessary remake of this masterpiece, and to recover my love for cinema, I decided to watch again the original version. \"King Kong\" is a fantastic movie, with a spectacular story with action, adventure, fantasy, horror, sci-fi and thriller; the special effects are amazing for a 1933 movie, with very few resources and equipment; and the use of sound, a few years after the silent period, and the powerful screams of Fay Wray, are awesome. I do not know the intention of Peter Jackson, but he was absolutely pretentious expecting to remake such a wonder. People who love the Seventh Art will certainly prefer this version, no matter how young he or she may be. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"King Kong\"", "I remember watching the 2005 King Kong movie in the theater and not thinking much of it because it wasn't anything too special. However, watching the original makes me appreciate the idea of King Kong. Not only were the effects revolutionary, but the story and characters to go along with it were stellar. It takes the classic idea of a misunderstood monster and puts a more emotional twist on it. You feel for both the damsel in distress and the monster alike.", "Released at the height of the Great Depression, \"King Kong\" was the ultimate great escape for audiences. Its greatest legacy is that over seventy years later, it still has that uncanny ability to completely transport the viewer into its fantasy world. This amazing adventure film is still one of the most viscerally exciting spectacles ever made and changed the course of movie history.The stop-motion animation was the most amazing special effects of its day and still hold up pretty well. The amazing sense of spectacle they created have inspired some of the greatest filmmakers of their generations. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron, and Peter Jackson wouldn't have been inspired to make the films they made had Kong not brilliantly paved the way.Aside from the technical innovations, you have a great music score from Max Steiner (who later scored \"Gone With the Wind\") that created the template for what movie scoring could do. He paved the way for the likes of John Williams and James Horner. Movie music, too, could be an art, and Steiner was the first to realize that with \"King Kong.\"Finally, you have the story, which is so much more than just a B-movie serial. It's amazing to find a special effects film that works on so many complex levels aside from the visuals. On one level this a innovative riff on the classic \"Beauty and Beast\" story with screen legend Fay Wray pitch perfect as actress Ann Darrow, the object of Kong's unrequited affections. On another level, this is gentle satire on movie making, with the reckless actions and sense of adventure and spectacle of director Carl Denham mirroring the real life adventures and desires of Kong's producer and co-director, the mythic-sized Merrion C. Cooper. Still, on a third level, this can be seen as a fable about the greatest jungle of them all, modern civilization, brilliantly realized through New York City. Not many films of this nature could be so rich.This iconic classic was \"modernized\" egregiously in 1976, and redone as a loving, period-piece homage in 2005.", "The thing has become an icon of vernacular culture. A decade or so ago an artist arranged to have a huge balloon of King Kong blown up and attached to the top of the Empire State Building. It didn't work. The consarned thing kept deflating and flapping around in the unanticipated wind.No matter. The image of Kong beating his chest, stripping off Fay Wray's clothes, fighting the Tyrannosaurus, shaking the men off the log into the spider pit, and finally being killed by those damned planes will survive Cristo's -- or anybody else's -- attempt to turn Kong into a work of art.Mainly, it's a work of technology. It was, to say the least, a labor-intensive project under people like Willis O'Brien, Meriam C. Cooper, and Ernest Shoedsack.What gets me about it is that it's so much more than that. King Kong, who was no more than a fourteen-inch puppet, let's face facts, was turned into a genuine actor. Look at his facial expressions. When he's enraged he LOOKS enraged. When he's sad, he looks sad. Now, those are easy expressions to form on a plastic, sculpted face. Blind people have sculpted accurate impressions of emotions like \"rage\" or \"fear\", not to mention Edvard Munch, who was nuts. But \"puzzlement\"? Check out Kong's expression when he's been seriously wounded by the constant shooting of the nasty airplanes and he picks at his wounds and looks at the blood on his fingertips. We sense that the animal is perfectly comfortable with fighting dinosaurs but has no idea of what he's now dealing with.I'm telling you, when he fell from the building to the ground I cried. I cried like a baby. By the way, when Fay Wray surfaces after the long plunge into the water, her garments slip off her shoulder and you can see what she's got.", "I could never tire of this movie, i've seen it so many times and always watch it when it's on tv-in fact i watched it just a week ago! It's one of those films that is rewatchable countless times, like many other 'monster' movies. But this is the best 'monster' movie , it is so well made-it is a masterpiece. Everything is right-the effects,the photography,the score,pacing,continuity. My favourite part would be the big middle chunk on the island. Ann captured-natives dance-a sacrifice to kong-rescue mission-defeat of stegasoraus-swamp adventure-swamp escape-log catastrophe-trex battle-snake creature fight-pterydactil disposal-rescue/escape-kong wrecks village-gas bomb. There is almost no let up in the action in this sequence. I have seen two versions of the film though. One was cut, the other wasn't. Some scenes that were cut: kong pulls a native out of his hut and stomps him into the mud. Brilliant. Also the bits when kong chews a native, and when he chews on a new yorker. And when he throws a woman down from a scraper into the street. Needless cutting in my book. A lot of people complain about the acting. The acting is swell. Robert Armstrong is perfect as the over enthusiastic director who is completely responsible for the deaths of hundreds of innocent people but has absolutely no scruples about it. He provides the silent chuckles of the movie e.g my one line summary is actually what denham says when he sees the savages and their dancing. And Bruce Cabot to Fay Wray: ' hey, i guess i love you!' in a moment of clarity. Overall a smashing film with a great climax. And kong is supposed to have the hots for fay wray too when he plays with her and her clothes", "Ignore the cranks who seem to look for subliminal messages and underlying hidden meanings in everything.  This is a monster movie and a love story and never pretends to be everything else.Hollywood film-makers of today could certainly learn a few things from watching it with its well-written characters, fast-paced and dynamic script which contains barely a dull moment, excellent dialogue and hauntingly memorable music.  Willis O'Brien's animation is at its best and Kong himself comes across as a genuine character and not an unsympathetic one.  Scenery is also imaginative, with marvellous attention paid to detail, and the monsters are well-designed.Still the best monster film ever made, if not the best film.", "Classic adventure film about film director Carl Denham(played by Robert Armstrong) headed to Skull Island on a ship under the command of Captain Englehorn(played by Frank Reicher) and his first mate Robert Driscoll(played by Bruce Cabot). Key to the picture is Ann Darrow(played by Fay Wray) who will find herself the unwilling center of attention from both the hostile native tribe and the \"god\" they worship: a giant ape called King Kong. After Ann is abducted, the crew pursue her into the jungle, where most of them die fighting dinosaurs and Kong, who is knocked unconscious and taken to New York, where he will escape and climb the Empire State Building in a legendary climax.Absolutely grand adventure film holds up beautifully today, and is quite exciting and harrowing. Sure, you could nitpick certain plot holes, but why bother in this near-perfect escapist entertainment. Not to be missed.", "As a guy whose pushing 52, I'm proud to say that this movie has been a profound influence on my life and is largely instrumental  into launching me into a career as an art director. I've seen this movie perhaps over 1,000 times. Before the advent of VHS, I would catch it anywhere in L.A. where there was a revival house. Saw it countless times before the \"lost\" footage was restored (which puts a competely  different spin on the complex character of Kong). I have a rare tape recording of the original Steiner \"prologue Music\" lasting over ten minutes (dubbed for me by a collector friend) which I don't think has made it onto the excellent Turner/Rhino CD soundtrack. And still I see something new upon each screening. I first saw Kong in 1956 on the local \"Million Dollar Movie\" show, a weekly feature of KHJ TV-9 - an RKO-General station. I remember the scenes of Kong throwing the \"wrong\" woman to her death as still intact...as well as a few feet of film where a New York fire engine flips-over after going around the corner (I've never seen that bit since). I was in a film class being taught by Rudy Behlmer at Art Center in 1971 when he matter-of-factly screened the \"lost\" footage in class (he had gotten access to it). I've seen nitrate prints screened at the L.A. County Museum of Art, UCLA and MOMA. I have seen this film with Fay Wray in attendance. I don't think I've ever missed a screening anywhere locally to the best of my knowledge. What bothers me is that today's audiences may not be able to project themselves back into time and try to relive the thrilling film-going experience circa 1933. They cannot grasp or accept the dialogue or style of acting at face-value; many consider it corny...or over-the-top.  Yet a comparison between Kong and say Jurassic Park III finds the latter's dialogue so stiltedly puerile and instantly forgettable that it cannot stand the test of time even in the present, let alone seventy years. In Kong, Bruce Cabot portrays a \"natural\" mug who plays his part beautifully as an uncouth mate aboard ship suddenly sharing his space with one of the prettiest women of all time (Fay Wray's looks are timeless, and she is still a \"hottie\" even by today's standards) . Is there any wonder that similarities between Cabot and Harrison Ford as \"Indiana Jones\" are not coincidental? If Cabot were alive today, he'd be the one earning millions. Robert Armstrong is perfect playing an impresario so full of energy he bursts at the seams. This is the way show people talked during the third decade of the Twentieth Century...full of what they used to call ballyhoo (check out Jimmy Cagney in \"Footlight Parade made in the same year for the same kind of high-voltage enthusiasm). Frank Reicher is totally believable as the captain, lending an even greater amount of  quasi-realism to the fable. Never discussed is fact that this movie is shot almost documentary-style...it has a mythical \"preserved-in-amber\" feel about it. It's as if what you are seeing is truly real...folklore-become-fact...and that the scenes unfolding actually happened once upon a time in 1933.  Who cannot visit New York City today and NOT think of King Kong on the rampage close to 70 years ago? I urge anyone who has not seen \"King Kong\" on the big screen to do so. When you hear  the any of the remarkable sound effects as you view the film, you will become a convert; for example, just listen to the all-too-real crunching of the Allosaurus' jawbone just before Kong ends its life (a death made all-the-more poignant by the way the carnivore is introduced to the audience-by innocently and realistically SCRATCHING ITS HEAD WITH ITS CLAW as it enters frame before the fight).  Absolute Perfection in a movie made up of absolute perfections. I could yammer on and on. But I won't.  All I can tell you is that for these and countless other reasons this film will always rate a 10-out-of-10. It is still the Greatest Adventure Movie Of All Time."], "tt0024266": ["This is one of the key titles from the classic period of Mexican horror, a period which was low on quantity but surprisingly high on quality. It precedes the two best-known films of the cycle, \"Dos Monjes\" and \"El Fantasma del Convento\", and shares some key personnel with them. La Llorona is a figure unique to Mexican folklore -- the wailing spirit of a woman who lost or killed her child and now returns to seek revenge and haunt the living. With its framing story and flashback structure, this film sets forth a couple of variations of the story. It is well-shot overall, with fine sets and shadowy photography (reminiscent at times of early US talkies like \"The Bat Whispers\"), and the scenes of the Llorona and her agents are often visually (and aurally) striking in their crude way. However, the bulk of the movie tends to be somewhat pedestrian and melodramatic, and it can't compare with the stylistic triumphs of \"Monjes\" and \"Fantasma\". As the first of the genre, though, it warrants plenty of admiration and respect. Also fascinating is the mixture of the \"pagan\" beliefs of the indigenous culture with the Catholic morality and ethics of the bourgeois classes, a contrast which would appear often in Mexican films. A later 1960s telling of the story (with the same title) fashions it more as a Gothic vampire piece, and is one of the finest contributions to the Latin horror revival of the time.", "The Hispanic-American legend of 'la llorona', the vengeful, wailing ghost of a woman who commits suicide after losing her child, has been fairly popular as of late, featuring in a spate of horror films such as The Legend of La Llorona (2011), The Haunting of La Llorona (2019), The La Llorona Curse (2019), La llorona (2019) , The Curse of La Llorona (2020), and La Llorona (2022).This 1933 Mexican movie was the first time the ghost was featured on film. It sees a family under a terrible centuries old curse, their children doomed to be stabbed to death when they reach the age of four. The curse relates to the legend of La Llorona (The Crying Woman), and in two flashbacks, we are shown the origins of two 'Lloronas', the first a woman rejected by her lover, who kills her son and herself, and the second an Indian woman whose son is taken by the conquistadors, driving her to take her own life.Unfortunately, the majority of the movie consists of dull melodrama, with very little in the way of style or supernatural happenings, making it a disappointing effort overall. Things pick up a touch towards the end of the film, as a sinister figure in a hooded robe kidnaps four-year-old Juanito, taking him into a secret room with the intention of killing him, thus fulfilling a vow sworn by their ancestor, but it doesn't make up for all of the dreary, slow-moving scenes that come before.3.5/10 rounded up to 4 for IMDb.", "The first Mexican horror film, this movie is all about the legend of \"The Crying Woman.\" There's been a film made about this story every few years and few of them are good. This one at least has some interesting atmosphere and is historically important.Maria is a woman who has two children and is quite poor, but finds a wealthy man to marry. However, he cares more about the kids than her, so in a jealous rage she drowns them both and kills herself. Now, she's trapped between life and death, unable to ever stop crying. She can never move to the next plane of existence until she finds her sons.The film also relates other tales of women who took the lives of their children, all reduced to being crying women as well. Obviously, this movie is very influenced by Universal's horror movies, yet it isn't the same level of quality. That said, it's still worth a view.", "Described on screen as \"A Modern-Day Version of the Popular Legend\", sadly this is one of those films that looks far more promising on paper than it is to actually watch.For obvious reasons it wasn't until the introduction of sound before the story could be done justice on the screen. Mexico's answer to the banshee has perennially provided material for the cinema right up to the present day, and the character of Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter novels probably continues the tradition.Bookended by two remarkably graphic scenes depicting corpses with their eyes open, unfortunately nearly half the film is devoted to swordplay rather than the phantom, which doesn't actually appear until the film has already been on for nearly forty minutes - almost half it's running time - and then gets lost in a welter of plots including a sinister hooded figure, the identity of whom when finally revealed admittedly really proves something!", "In the series Leyendas Coloniales/de Mexico La Llorona is one Luisa Marquesa Del Llano, who bore childs, one boy one girl to one Nu\u00f1o De Montesclaros. He tried to take the children with an order from the viceroy of New Spain(now Mexico) instead of turning them over she stabbed (not drown) them. My question is those involved were members of the nobility, early Spanish settler. Hasn't anyone tried to search for records (since they were nobles some mention of them should be available in Spanish archives) to at least verify whether these people existed. Also she was hanged for her crime, there should be records of her trial and execution.", "This is a movie that I found when looking for horror films from 1933. I'll be honest, my first introduction to this lore of the La Llorona aka The Crying Woman was thanks to the Conjuring universe. I saw that movie deal with this entity in the theater and realized that this is a staple of Mexican culture. It is a story that I would like to learn more about and it excited me to check this out.Synopsis: Llorona is a figure unique to Mexican folklore - the wailing spirit of a woman who lost or killed her child and now returns to seek revenge and haunt the living.We start this off by seeing a stone image. This will come back into play later. There is then a man walking outside. It is close to midnight and when it strikes, he dies. It is thought to be a heart attack while others believe it is the spirit of La Llorona. Dr. Ricardo de Acuna (Ram\u00f3n Pereda) doesn't believe in the supernatural. He trusts there's a medical reason as to the death of this man.This is an important day. Ricardo's son Juanito is turning four. Helping to throw the party is Ricardo's wife, Ana Maria (Virginia Zur\u00ed). Also here is Ana's father, Don Fernando de Moncada (Paco Mart\u00ednez). He takes Ricardo aside to tell him the story of the de Acuna family and their curse. We then go into a flashback to learn of what happened.In the past, Pereda portrays his ancestor who is the captain of the guard, Diego de Acuna. He is in love with a woman by the name of Ana Xicont\u00e9ncatl (Adriana Lamar). She has the illegitimate child to the local royalty, Marqu\u00e9s del Valle (Alberto Mart\u00ed). There is an issue here that he cannot recognize her child as it will upset his family. Diego doesn't like this and calls him out at church where the Marqu\u00e9s is getting married. This creates issues that lead to Ana killing her son.Ricardo finds the story interesting, but he doesn't believe that it affects anything. We see there is a hooded figure in the house, trying to kill Juanito. This person is referred to as La Malinche. Ricardo needs to figure out what is going on before it is too late. Whomever this hooded figure is, might not be working on their own freewill. The spirit of La Llorona might be involved.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that this is different than I was expecting. What I appreciate here is that this establishes the lore and a couple possible ways this ghost story/lore started. What I've heard is that this woman was upset for being left, which is in line with Ana and her son not being recognized by Marqu\u00e9s del Valle. She then drowned her children. Those that encounter her, hear her crying. Some of that is here. There is a creepy cry that comes from the ghostly apparition. We see and hear it a couple times. I liked that. It made it spooky.I do need to shift to a negative here, we don't get a lot of it. This movie decides to ground what we are getting. I don't mind what the reveal is. What works there is that whoever is behind it is not able to control themselves. It is a bit of a possession film there. What I would have preferred though was more of a ghost story. We can keep in what we get but give me more haunting. I understand that this is a 'me problem'. I'm projecting what I want as opposed to what we get.What did work though was the history we get. A variation on the how La Llorona became the figure that she is was good to me. I even like that we then get another aspect of what she came after another of the de Acuna ancestors. What is interesting about what is given is that Ricardo is both correct and wrong. That was a good route to go.Where I'll then go would be the acting. I thought that Pereda did a good job in dual roles as Ricardo and his ancestor of Diego. We are in the early cinema days so he doesn't do a lot, but it still worked. Zur\u00ed was good as this protective mother. The same could be said for Lamar, but what she does is crazy. It fits though for the lore. Mart\u00ed was also solid in his double roles. I didn't pick up on the fact that he was also Rodrigo de Cort\u00e9s. It makes more sense now. Other than that, I'd say that Carlos Orellana, Esperanza del Real, Mart\u00ednez and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.All that is left then to go into would be with filmmaking. The best part of this is the soundtrack and design. The crying sound for La Llorona is eerie. It is mostly synced up with a song that starts heavy with drums before going to an eerie tune. That was effective for me. The cinematography is solid. It is early cinema again so they don't do much to stand out. As for the effects, we don't get a lot and that is again when this came out. I did like the ghostly effect of La Llorona. If there is a gripe, I wanted more of that.In conclusion, this is a solid film. I don't know if it is necessarily what I wanted. I acknowledge that it isn't fair to judge the movie that way. What this does well is establishing the history of the La Llorona lore. I don't know enough to know how close it is. The acting though is solid. The soundtrack and design are good. No issues with the effects aside from just wanting more. I watched this on YouTube. The subtitles weren't synced up well so that threw me off. I think if you're into early cinema or want to learn more about this lore, this is a decent enough watch.My Rating: 7 out of 10."], "tt0024360": ["I'm extremely fond of ancient horror movies from the late twenties and early thirties, but admittedly they are usually rather soft and tame both in terms of tone and execution. A. Edward Sutherland's \"Murders in the Zoo\", however, is not! The concept of the film, and particularly Lionel Atwill's hunter/millionaire character are astonishingly crude and relentless for a 1933 production. Probably so crude, even, that the producers eventually backed off anyways and - unfortunately - decided to compensate the cruelty of the essential plot with far too much light-headed comical relief in the shape of contemporary popular jester Charlie Ruggles. Who knows, without Ruggles, \"Murders in the Zoo\" might have become as controversial and universally banished as \"Freaks\" was for several long decades, so I can certainly respect the producers' choice.The opening sequence is as fiendish and twisted as they come. After he allegedly just 'wanted to kiss her', Eric Gorman (Atwill) blandly disposes of an admirer of his wife by stitching up his lips and leaving him behind in a dark jungle full of wild animals. Back in the US, the petrified wife still has plans to run off with another lover, but the diabolical Gorman uses the zoo to which he supplies exotic animals as a macabre disposal ground. In between, the hysterical Ruggles goofs around as the zoo's marketeer/PR-spokesperson who's afraid of animals. \"Murders in the Zoo\" benefices from several things, most notably the unpredictable script (you genuinely can't tell who will or won't survive), the classy cinematography of Oscar winner Ernest Haller and the bone-chilling performance of Lionel Atwill. This legendary underrated actor was an evil genius as Dr. Moriarty in \"Hound of the Baskervillers\" and a vicious psychopath in \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\", but he was never more terrifying as here in this 30s horror gem.", "This rarely-seen film is astonishingly gruesome for the time in which it was made, especially when compared to the other popular horror films of the time, like Dracula, which merely hinted at depravity and had all the violence occur off screen. Not so with MURDERS IN THE ZOO, a film which opens with a man having his lips sewn together for a minor misdemeanour, a stark moment designed to shock an audience hungry for blood. I'll bet that the opening moments got a few people fainting in the aisles, after all, they probably never expected anything like it.Today the film is worth seeing not just for the shocks, but for the characterisation too. Gorman, the central character, is a husband whose insane jealousy of any man his wife flirts with leads him to coldly murder all involved. Lionel Atwill plays Gorman with just the right glossy sheen of respectability, hiding all the oozing evilness underneath with ease. Atwill gives a wonderful performance, really adding strength to the character, when he might just as well have been an over-the-top maniac. Just watch Gorman entertaining dinner guests above the table while underneath it he stabs venom into a rival's leg, killing him. I would say that this film shows Atwill at his best, a man whose coldly calculating mind is finally outwitted by a triumph of science, an anti-toxin which returns one of his victims from the dead.The use of a zoo as a setting is an interesting one, and allows for plenty of footage of lions and snakes to pad out the running time. Although there is a low body count, the deaths are inventive, with Atwill planning them intrinsically to make them look like accidents. The supporting cast is a good one, with Kathleen Burke (the panther woman from ISLAND OF LOST SOULS) making a striking heroine, and Charles Ruggles manages to be amusing, although I could have done without his non-stop comic relief. I know that most of these early films had wisecracking reporters prowling around, but this comedy goes on and on throughout the film, balancing uneasily with the grisly murders occurring - in fact, it almost seems like it should belong in a different film.Another plus is the extremely short (sixty minute) running time, which keeps things flowing along smoothly and never lets up with the action. The film is at it's best when shocking the audience, either with the aforementioned mouth-stitching or the bit where Gorman drops his wife into a pit full of crocodiles which proceed to gobble her up (other films would have cut away at this point, but not this one). Atwill's terrific performance is just the icing on the cake in this neat story of a madman's short reign of terror.", "A madman commits a series of MURDERS IN THE ZOO, hoping to punish his adulterous wife and her lovers.Sadly neglected, this dandy little thriller comes from a studio & director (Paramount, Edward Sutherland) more noted for their comedy films. It holds its own, however, and offers several visual shocks which should more than satisfy its audience. Especially noteworthy are the opening credits which humorously compares the human stars with various zoo beasts, and sweeps immediately into an initial scene of unusually fiendish ferocity. From this point on, the viewer is hooked...Lionel Atwill adds another portrait of evil to his gallery of grotesques, here playing a villain not only morally twisted but positively vile. The gentle, daffy humor of top-billed Charles Ruggles might seem out of place in other horror films, but here it is a welcome anodyne to Atwill's monstrosities.The rest of the cast - Randolph Scott, Gail Patrick, Kathleen Burke, Harry Beresford - do very well in roles that are really little more than supporting parts. Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Jane Darwell as a society matron at the Zoo Supper.", "Three murders are committed during this film, two of them are indeed Murders In The Zoo. The problem for the authorities is that they're not murders because animals leave no forensics to tell any tales. Well almost.Lionel Atwill is a brilliant zoologist, tops in his field and an insanely jealous man. To be sure he's got reason to be, Kathleen Burke is not the most faithful of wives. In this before the Code classic it's really hard to tell whether Atwill was insane by nature or she's driven him that way because of her infidelities.Because of his knowledge of animal habits and methods of killing, Atwill can hide his homicides and blame them on the zoo animals he's captured for Harry Beresford's zoo.Two great character actors dominate Murder In The Zoo. Of course Lionel Atwill who graced so many of the best Gothic horror tales is perfectly cast as the jealous husband who's doing in all potential rivals. Charlie Ruggles is also great as the alcoholic former newspaperman who is on his last job as the zoo press agent. His nervous little everyman is great for comic relief. All that was really needed was Mary Boland in the film as the domineering wife to Ruggles which she played in so many Paramount classics.A couple of younger players with big things destined for them both in front and behind the camera, Randolph Scott and Gail Patrick are the romantic interest. John Davis Lodge future Governor of Connecticut and Ambassador to Spain plays one of Burke's suitors who is dispatched quite cleverly.No monsters in this film, the most terrifying thing on this planet is the mind of mortal man run amuck out of jealousy or ambition. That's what Murders In The Zoo has in abundance.", "I am shocked,well, okay that word may be a bit strong, at a couple of the comments on here with regards to this film.  This IS a great little horror gem that needs more press for its atmosphere and for the wonderful performance of Lionel Atwill.  Atwill is amazing as a jealous millionaire/adventurer use to getting his way.  The opening has Atwill, wife, and company in India and the Orient in search of wild animals for the Municipal Zoo, of which Atwill is a great benefactor.  We soon see what kind of man Atwill is as he literally sews a man's lips shut and leaves him for dead in the wild, saying, \"He will never lie again, nor will he ever kiss another's woman.\"  Atwill then goes back to camp, questioned by his wife where this man is saying he just fled.  His wife asks if he said anything about where he was going and Atwill replies in his wonderfully droll, sardonic manner, \"He didn't say anything.\"  It is this kind of black humour in Atwill's performance throughout the whole film that really helps this movie rise from some of its obvious flaws.  Yeah, I know Charlie Ruggles got top billing for his comedic \"drunk\" routine.  I rather liked it myself, but can see where it might get tiresome after awhile.  Some of the other performers are very wooden including character actors like Harry Beresford and particularly John Lodge as yet another man trying to seduce(a fairly easy task given the promiscuous nature of Atwill's lovely wife)Kathleen Burke as Atwill's wife.  Burke gives a decent performance but looks a whole lot better than she acts.  A small concession this reviewer can live with. But the film belongs to Atwill all the way.  As one reviwer noted earlier, his evil presence is in many ways comparable to Leslie Banks in The Most dangerous Game and Charles Laughton in The Island of the Lost Souls.  Atwill is sadean to the point of complete lack of care for anyone but himself.  The zoo is impressive and some of the best scenes are a dinner given amidst all the carnivorous cats and the bridge that goes over a pool of crocodiles. Also, watch for a great scene with Atwill and Randolph Scott where Atwill, holding the head of a mamba in a tissue, tries to prick Scott when he is not looking.  Another gem of black humour.  One big flaw is the mamba itself. It is a boa or a python.  Cannot have everything.  The MCA-Universal print is as clear as you will find.  A great film with an even greater Atwill performance!", "Eric Gorman (Lionel Atwill) hunts down exotic wildlife for a zoo back in the States. He also has an intense jealous streak when it comes to men interacting with his wife (Kathleen Burke from THE horror film of the 30's, Island of Lost Souls). So jealous that he's more than willing to kill any man he deems a threat, and his weapons of choice are the animals that he has access to.This is a solid 30's horror picture with a unique storyline. It also has a pretty potent mean streak for a film of it's time, one scene involving an alligator pit coming immediately to mind. Lionel Atwill has an effective screen presence as the sinister Gorman. As murderous as he may be, I found it hard to root against the man. What can I say? I'm not remotely sympathetic towards philanderers. His idea to utilize animals as murder weapons is both one of convenience and a clever way to be free of incriminating evidence. The animal attacks, including an encounter with a large python, are intense and believable.My main qualm with the film is a problem that plagues many pictures of the era, that being the style of comic relief that was popular back then. The Peter Yates character is pretty annoying, and we're treated to a particularly absurd scene where he pops a lion on the head. Charlie Ruggles plays Yates, and he's about as unfunny as it gets. Why he has such a prevailing presence in an otherwise serious film is beyond me. The time taken up by his antics could have been used to further develop our main storyline.However, this is worth seeing. It's also well-paced, clocking in at just a little more than an hour in length.", "The pre-\"Code\" horror flick \"Murders in the Zoo\" is noteworthy for being quite potent for its time. If only some of the comedy relief were eliminated and the horror quotient punched up even more, it really could have been something special. As it is, it's enjoyable but may not be intense enough for the modern viewer. It's highlighted by a wonderfully deranged performance by genre icon Lionel Atwill, here playing Eric Gorman, a zoologist who's pathologically jealous of his hot young wife Evelyn (Kathleen Burke of \"Island of Lost Souls\"), who admittedly is not exactly faithful to him. He's well aware that his animals make for handy murder weapons, so he employs them whenever he wants to eliminate a man from Evelyns' life.Three sequences stand out here as being appropriately intense. The film establishes a tone immediately; it begins as Eric sews a mans' mouth shut! Another involves a victim tossed into an alligator pit. And the finale sees many animals escape their cages, and the skirmishes between the big cats are all too convincing. A huge snake gets to do its thing before this is all over.Capably directed by A. Edward Sutherland, \"Murders in the Zoo\" does waste some time with its principal comic character, a drunken press agent played by top-billed Charles Ruggles. Ruggles is amiable enough, but isn't funny enough to warrant that much screen time. Otherwise, it's just zippy enough to clock in at a mere 63 minutes. The supporting cast helps keep it watchable: Gail Patrick, Randolph Scott, future Connecticut governor John Lodge, Harry Beresford, Samuel S. Hinds, and Edward McWade. The cinematography is by the celebrated Ernest Haller (\"Gone with the Wind\", \"Rebel Without a Cause\", etc.).Overall, a fun film worth a look for genre fans and completists.Seven out of 10.", "Opening up in Africa with the murder of a zoologist's wife's lover, this frightening thriller doesn't use monsters, mad scientists or ancient mummy's to provide the chills, but nature itself. Lionel Atwill is his delightfully villianess self as the zoologist who uses the deadly green mamba, a giant anaconda like snake, to do his dirty work, and back in the states, as evidence begins to point to him, more bizarre murders occur. Charlie Ruggles brings the tone down from frights to laughs as a man whose skin crawls anytime he's around anything other than a human being. Even milk-craving baby bears and a friendly chimp have him on edge. There's some truly horrifying moments here, including one clever disposal of a body, and a finale that is up there with the final shot of \"Freaks\" in the art of the macabre. Kathleen Burke (as Atwill's wife), Randolph Scott and Gail Patrick offer fine support, but this is Atwill's film all the way.", "The opening scene from \"Murders in the Zoo\" is quite extreme for 1933 audiences . I shalln't say what happens but you can't miss it!Lionel Atwill steals the show once again as the sadistic, cunning and evil proprietor of various dangerous animals that he plans to sell to a zoo. Little does anyone realise that he shall use his animals for other means........You only have to observe the expression of Lionel Atwill to know he is a somewhat dodgy customer.This gem was unfairly ignored for years but is very good on its own merits.", "This is a good pre-code example of a horror film that must have shocked audiences in the early '30s and still carries enough punch to find favor with today's horror addicts.LIONEL ATWILL is at his wickedest as a cold-blooded owner of a zoo full of wild animals, everything from snakes to panthers. The story starts overseas with him doing an unusual sewing job on one of his victims after catching him kissing his wife, then switches to their return on a ship where his wife is fearful that a young man who has taken a shine to her (JOHN LODGE) will be his next victim.Atwill catches them having an intimate chat and we know he's found a man he must eliminate in a cruel way. It goes on in this fashion with the criminal getting away with murder until a clever lab technician (RANDOLPH SCOTT) and his assistant (GAIL PATRICK) are able to turn the tables on him.TCM features a good print of this little thriller, way ahead of its time in some of its subject matter, a film that any fan of Lionel Atwill's kind of villainy will want to catch. And incidentally, Randolph Scott and Gail Patrick are excellent in good supporting roles.Only drawback is the \"comic relief\" given to CHARLES RUGGLES who gives his weak material a good try but becomes more of an annoyance than anything else in the role of the zoo's new publicity agent.", "I first came across this film in a review in one of William Everson's compendiums of horror film classics. He spoke quite highly of it, but until tonight I never had seen it.MURDERS AT THE ZOO has the plus of Lionel Atwill as a big game hunter named Eric Gorman. He is quite an expert on deadly animals and brings them to the zoo in the city he lives in. But his wife Evelyn (Katherine Burke) has a way of attracting younger, and handsomer men to her attention. Atwill is fiendishly possessive and jealous, and proceeds to kill any man who is having an affair with his wife. But he uses his knowledge of the wild and animals (he later explains he loves animals because of their honesty regarding their feelings, including kill or be killed) to destroy these men. We first see him tying up and leaving a man in the jungle to be destroyed by man-eating tigers. But first he sews the man's lips together so he can't lie or kiss another man's wife (or call for help). A close-up of the man with bloodied, threaded face is briefly shown on camera.On the voyage back home from India Burke meets an American traveler played by John Lodge. Lodge and Burke begin an affair (which Atwill soon is aware of). Atwill pretends he is unaware of it, and invites Lodge to a dinner party (to raise funds for the zoo - this is the depression). At the party Lodge dies, the victim (apparently) of the bite of a green mamba snake that Atwill brought back from India which may have escaped from it's cage. The person that was responsible for the care of the new acquisition is Randolph Scott, here not in his normal western milieu but playing a reptile expert. Scott, with assistant and girl friend Gail Patrick, is struggling to create an anti-toxin for snake venom, particularly those of the deadly Mamba snakes. Atwill jumps to the conclusion that Scott has been criminally negligent regarding watching this deadly snake, and wishes to press charges against him. However, Burke is less willing to believe Scott is responsible, and soon is aware of who is responsible...which is not healthy for her.The use of a deadly snake for killing purposes goes back to Conan Doyle and \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" in the first collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories. But the character I found interesting here is Scott, the reptile man at the zoo. It is hard for us to realize but in the 1930s Americans were still fascinated by the world of zoos and aquariums and the people who searched for or dealt with rare animals. Frank Buck's book BRING 'EM BACK ALIVE described his adventures hunting and trapping dangerous animals (it was a big best seller). The career of Clyde Beatty, as an animal trapper specialist, was followed and led to his career as a circus entrepreneur. But another figure of interest in New York City (which apparently is the city in this film) was Raymond Ditmars, who was in charge of the reptiles in the city zoos and was a recognizable authority on snakes. It is probable that he is the basis for Scott's character (especially in searching for anti-toxins).Atwill gives one of his finest performances here, Gorman's fascination with animals being as important as his sexual insanity (hinted at by his weird, occasional smiling stares and Burke's obvious disgust at him). The acting is competent, particularly Scott and Patrick. There is this problem I find with the fans and opponents of poor Charley Ruggles. Playing an alcoholic reporter trying this last chance job as a publicist, Ruggles is drunk in a couple of scenes (not through the entire film), and has a very funny moment when he finds himself next to the missing green mamba snake - leading to a request for information that could only appear in such a film prior to the real enforcement of the code on movies. He plays a major role in finally bringing Atwill to book at the end. And his last appearance (although drunk) is a curious counterpoint to his Major Applegate in BRINGING UP BABY only four years later.I only have one real problem with this neat little movie - how did Atwill contrive to use his \"weapon\" without being observed by the people at the dinner? It never is really explained.", "I really like Lionel Atwill in this film. No, I'm not normally a guy who goes for the \"villain,\" but as someone who could identify with a man who's been cheated on, I kind of sympathized with him. Of course, I wouldn't go to his lengths to get back at a woman, but it made for an interesting film! Atwill's \"Eric Gorman\" runs a zoo and has a young wife who has no interest in him, who cheats on whatever good-looking young guy is around. Gorman gets wind of her activities, confronts her and she tells him, \"Yeah, so what? I hate your guts anyway (to paraphrase).\" To Gorman's credit, he keeps his cool but inside he is steaming and he winds up with a few clever ideas on how to handle her boyfriend.What he does, and how, makes for an exciting second half of this film. The first part is a little slow, but stay with it because the second part is very, very suspenseful. It also has some excellent film-noir-type cinematography.The first half of this one-hour movie was more of a comedy than anything else, however, as Charles Ruggles plays a goofy guy who becomes the public relations man at the zoo. Mostly, he makes stupid comments and is annoying but later he does a couple of funny bits (like when he was trapped in a zoo cage with a huge snake). Still, this movie's genre is labeled \"horror/crime/mystery\" but you wouldn't know it until Ruggles mainly disappears and the Atwill starts to go after his wife and her boyfriend \"Roger Hewitt\" (John Lodge). Then, the whole atmosphere of this film changes and there is plenty of \"atmosphere.\" It's good stuff.A new notes: Randolph Scott plays a scientist and it just doesn't look right. To me, Scott only looks natural in a western setting, and I think he'd agree with that since he went that route almost exclusively a few years after this movie in 1933......This film, and others like it, were released just a few weeks ago (late Oct., 2009) on DVDs, offered by the TCM Network as part of the \"Universal Cult Horrors\" Collection. They are kind of pricey but I bet they look great on disc.", "A rather strange movie - because everyone plays it straight except Charlie Ruggles, who acts as if he is in a slapstick comedy! He plays a marketing man for a municipal zoo who is deathly afraid of animals, and he made me chuckle once or twice, but a little of him goes a long way. The film is thinly plotted, but it contains some fascinating animal footage, and Lionel Atwill is perversely pleasurable to watch as the villain; he is murderously mad with jealousy and desire for his unfaithful wife (Kathleen Burke). It's roles like this one that have made him one of the most important predecessors of horror icons such as Vincent Price. **1/2 out of 4.", "It starts improbably with lions in a South East Asian jungle and Lionel Atwill sewing up the mouth of his wife's latest lover, leaving him to die helplessly. Not nice! And it gets even better, in what is a delicious hour and a minute from Paramount in their wonder period of 1930/4.A tale of insane jealousy leading to murders and in what passes for that now endangered species, a zoo, although obviously backlots and back projections abound in a rather darkly atmospheric mix. The main characters run true to typecast: Randolph Scott as the clever handsome good guy with ever-grinning Gail Patrick as his clever and loyal sidekick, Charles Ruggles as the well-meaning bumbling buffoon and Atwill as the manic sex fiend (hmm\u0085). This was probably his best ever performance \u2013 witness his wide-eyed and frantic lust for his wife after he'd killed another of her boyfriends. Although just how it was done is still a mystery to me. Atwill was eaten up by jealousy but was eventually eaten up by alligators \u2013 how poignant!Years ago my then little daughter and I loved this one and it still holds up well as a wicked little suspense film, lovely and creaky, full of horrid humour and a cast who looked as though they enjoyed themselves making it.", "While not on the creepy level of Edgar Ulmer's \"The Black Cat\", this film shows that a studio OTHER THAN Universal was trying to make horror films in the early thirties. I will agree that Charlie Ruggles' tipsy clowning tends to diffuse the genuine horror of the situation, but this seems to almost have been a requirement of horror films of thirties, as this same type of character is found in \"Mystery of the Wax Museum\", and \"Doctor X\", both films starring Lionel Atwill. Maybe they just wanted to offset Atwill's natural creepiness, eh? At any rate, A big kudos to MCA/Universal for even releasing this film on home video, and for using one of the most beautiful prints I've ever seen! Now, if we can just get them to put out MURDER BY THE CLOCK...", "There's a famous gag that a camel is a horse that was designed by a committee. Murders in the Zoo is a good, creepy early '30s thriller with one design flaw so wrong as to sink the whole thing. Every thriller has a little comic relief character. In this one it's the zoo's publicist who is afraid of animals. But somebody came up with the bright idea of casting Charlie Ruggles in this role. Now Ruggles is basically a one-note comic actor who inexplicably attained name-above-the-title stardom. And with his name in the cast, suddenly this supporting role became the starring role. You can see all the places where scenes were added or expanded to give the character more screen time. But he is still just the comic relief--he is not involved in any way with any major development in the storyline. He could be excised completely and never be missed. Randolph Scott is the hero and Lionel Atwill the villain, and both acquit themselves admirably. But every few minutes the forward movement of the story comes to a screeching halt while we are treated to the antics of the \"star\", and so the poor camel never quite gets his gait. The film has some genuinely classic \"horror movie\" moments, but it would be so very much better with a reliable character man providing the \"comic relief\" instead of making this relatively insignificant role into a star turn (for ANY star).", "Despite the casting of comedian, Charlie Ruggles, as the go-getting lead of Murders in the Zoo (1933), it's actually Randolph Scott who saves the day, but not before villainous Lionel Atwill does his stuff!I must admit I'm a sucker for movies set in a zoo, and this one is no exception despite the fact that we know exactly who the killer is right from the very opening shot.Nonetheless, despite the hard task they set themselves by revealing the killer at this incredibly early stage, screenwriters Seton I. Miller and Philip Wylie do contrive at least two or three quite unexpected twists in the plot.Director Eddie Sutherland is not the most stylish of the Hollywood crop, but he sure knows how keep the story moving along at an agreeable and always interesting level.", "This seldom-seen hidden gem features the sadistic Lionel Atwill at his evil best. As a jealous zoologist, he resorts to drastic measures by using his animals to kill any man who makes a play for his luscious wife (Kathleen Burke, the panther woman from ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, who exudes exotic beauty). There are some pretty \"extreme\" methods of dealing death for such an early film, utilizing snakes, alligators and one pretty horrific sequence involving \"sewing\".The only wrench in the works is the maddeningly unfunny comedian, Charlie Ruggles (who even gets top billing!) who's like a consistent thorn in the side of the movie whenever he pops in every now and then. I'm not one for altering original films under any circumstances, but I may make a unique exception in this case to excise all of this idiot's scenes. Luckily, the movie still emerges as an easy and enjoyable 62 minutes if you ignore Ruggles and savor the main plot of a green-eyed husband making people pay. *** out of ****", "As is noted by everyone, the decision to soften this horror with extensive scenes of supposed humour from Charlie Ruggles is a shame. Still, this is to take nothing away from Lionel Atwill's fine performance nor the bewitching presence of that strange but beguiling lady, Kathleen Burke. There is a dramatic opening when after it looks as if we are to simply imagine what atrocity has been committed we are confronted with a poor man's sew up mouth in close-up. Nothing is quite as graphic afterwards but there are splendid scenes of the non-PC zoo and a fine, animals let loose scene, towards the end, before a rather splendid denouement even if it involves the wrong sort of snake. Far too much silliness from Ruggles and a rather bloodless alligator pool sequence, without even the hint of a human limb, but overall well worth a watch and pretty bold for the times.", "I'd recorded this on Chiller a long time ago and just got around to watching it tonight. This is a really good little piece of work.Dr. Gorman's insane jealousy drives him to murder anyone he suspects of trying to take his wife away from him. While on safari he stitches a suspected rival's lips together and abandons him in the jungle. Returning to the states, he dispatches one potential rival with snake venom. When his much younger wife gets wise to him he feeds her to the alligators (interestingly enough, the zoo has just a simple wooden bridge over the pit where they live).Eventually his misdeeds catch up with him. In a very effective scene Gorman turns a bunch of lions loose to stop the police who are pursuing him. He then runs, soon pursued by the lions, and finds safety in an animal cage. Wouldn't you just know it! He forgets that the cage he's found shelter in houses a huge snake, and what you expect to happen does.The chase scene is surprising in that there's no pulsing music to emphasize the action. The ringing of an alarm bell, the roar of the lions, and very effectively used silence when Gorman is being pursued are more effective than any music that could have been used.First and foremost, this looks great. The print is crisp and sharp. The sets are elaborate- these were probably standing sets on the Paramount lot that were redressed for the film.It's handsomely photographed by Ernest Haller, who you might remember for a somewhat more upscale film a few years later. You may have seen it: GONE WITH THE WIND.It's made clear from get-go that Gorman is the killer. Lionel Atwill always played the bad guy. Take a few minutes on IMDb and check out his tragic life story.Charlie Ruggles was a very popular actor at the time. He gets top billing as a booze addled loser who gets a job doing public relations for the zoo. To my thinking his part could have been eliminated completely, but he doesn't do a huge lot of damage.", "Who said the old horror movie weren't graphic, this baby begins with Lionel Atwill sewing a man's mouth closed before feeding him to the animals and going on from there. Great classic horror film thats been picked apart over the years for other films but its never really been done as good as this. The plot is simple, Atwill runs the zoo and uses the animals to dispose of people who annoy him or try to get too close to the women he loves. Its dark and creepy stuff that sends shivers up and down your spine, not so much for what it shows, which isn't much, but for what it doesn't. If you want the perfect mixture of terror of the eyes and terror of the mind this is it. Perfectly paced and played it does what it does and gets off. I can't recommend this film enough. Its great (even if its a tad creaky)", "Universal wasn't the only studio making horror films - Paramount made a few bizarre ones as well. \"Murder by the Clock\" (1931), \"The Island of Lost Souls\" (1932) and \"Murders in the Zoo\", which was considered quite tasteless at the time. When it was released, censor boards around America went at it with a pair of shears and when it was shown on television even more cuts were made.Lionel Atwill plays Eric Gorman, a wealthy zoologist, who uses his knowledge of animals to kill off his wife's lovers. The first scene is quite shocking as Eric is seen in the jungle, sewing up his human victim's lips, like a head hunter and leaving him at the mercy of the wild animals. Later when his wife, Evelyn (Kathleen Burke) innocently asks him if the man left any message for her, Eric carelessly replies - \"he didn't say anything\"!!! Oh well, Evelyn has already started a shipboard romance with John Hewitt (John Lodge) but Eric is insanely jealous and Hewitt is worried about his and Evelyn's safety. When they are all back at the Zoo, irritating press agent, Peter Yates (Charlie Ruggles) suggests a slap up dinner among the animals as a publicity stunt to bring the Zoo some much needed funds.Evelyn is planning to follow Hewitt to Paris but unfortunately neither of them make it. During the dinner Hewitt is bitten by a deadly mamba snake that has mysteriously been released among the diners. Evelyn meets her fate in a thrilling chase that culminates in a struggle over an ornamental bridge. Eric uses chloroform and then throws Evelyn's lifeless body into the crocodile infested stream. Of course, in front of others he assumes horrified anger and charges the young chemist, Jack Woodford (Randolph Scott) with negligence - he also closes the Zoo. When the missing mamba is found, Jack makes a shocking discovery - the width of it's bite proves it is not the same snake that killed Hewitt. It paves the way for a gripping climax as Eric tries to kill Jack with mamba venom!!! Unfortunately - for Eric, Jerri (Gail Patrick) has found an anti venom for the mamba poison and she is able to administer it while Eric madly runs from all the wild animals he has let loose - only to find himself in the cage of one wild beast he can't master!!!This is a fantastic horror movie, only slowed down by Charlie Ruggles' unfunny clowning. He was even topped billed but that was because he was a Paramount star, while Lionel Atwill, who was fabulous, in my opinion, was only borrowed. Kathleen Burke, who won the \"Panther Girl\" contest (apparently from 60,000 other girls) but she wasn't given much to do after that. She was perfect as the unfaithful Evelyn. Gail Patrick and Randolph Scott played the love interest - both went on to greater stardom. According to a FIR article, Lionel Atwill became fascinated with the 25 foot python and insisted that it really be allowed to wrap itself around his body. Eddie Sutherland tried to talk him out of it, then Paramount had to hire snake handlers to stand by to unwrap Atwill as he revelled in the grisly scene.Highly Recommended.", "Murders in the Zoo (1933)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Lionel Atwill plays a game hunter/zookeeper who uses his animals to seek vengeance on the men who dare flirt with his beautiful wife. This early horror film from Paramount still packs a nice punch even today thanks to some pretty graphic violence, which is still shocking today so there's no telling what people thought back in 1933. The film starts off with Atwill sewing a man's mouth shut and things just get more graphic from there. The performance from Atwill is wonderful and Randolph Scott is also very good in his role.", "I do enjoy watching Lionel Atwill. Unfortunately, this movie is pretty much without redemption from the asinine murder plot to the humor to the acting to the big lunk, Randolph Scott. Ruggles takes any sort of credibility out of the thing with his silly drunk routine and constant sidetracking. The plot is about a jealous man who kills off anyone who gets the least bit close to his wife. He is big game \"bring em back alive\" sort of figure. It's one of those films that must have been made to fill a theatre with little kids on a Saturday in the forties. Atwill is really venomous (so to speak), but when he kills his wife (the object of his jealousy) that seems out of character. Zoos must have been quite the attraction in those days. It comes across as pretty exotic."], "tt0024368": ["These days, Mystery of the Wax Museum has become best known for the fact that it was the film that spawned the 1953 classic starring Vincent Price. This is somewhat unfair, however, as although this film isn't a brilliant masterpiece, or even genre classic, it has a right to remembered in it's own right. The film is actually quite daring and inventive for the time when it was made; and despite the fact that nothing too bad is graphically shown, for obvious reasons, some of the imagery on display does actually succeed in being quite disturbing. Take the deformed face of the central character for example; it won't keep you up all night, but considering the time when this was made; the effects are good. The two-strip Technicolor style of the film gives it something of a unique feel; and this again is to it's credit as the film has aged really, really well. The plot line will be familiar to anyone who has seen the Vincent Price version, but here, aside from a museum proprietor that gets his life work melted away in an inferno; we've got a press investigation into the affairs as well.Lionel Atwill takes the lead role as the unfortunate victim of the flames, and while he's certainly no Vincent Price; he does well with what he's got and helps to create a macabre surrounding around his character, which in turn helps the film in the atmosphere department. Joining him are Glenda Farrell and Fay Wray as the heroine's of the story. Wray plays the girl that the unfortunate artist becomes obsessed with, and Farrell gives a slightly irritating, but very lively performance as a journalist. Both do well with their roles, and although this film isn't exactly an exhibition in acting (unlike Curtiz's masterpiece, Casablanca); the cast do well enough. One thing that is unfortunate for this film is that it's seen as a second feature for the Price version, which will harm what some viewers think of it as the plot elements are very similar to the 1953 film, so it can, at times, feel as though you're simply watching the same film again. However, if viewed as a stand-alone product, Mystery of the Wax Museum represents a solid 30's horror movie and I can see why any horror fan wouldn't enjoy it.", "Classic horror movie directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Lionel Atwill as a deranged sculptor with an \"interesting\" method of making the statues on display at his wax museum. The last (and best) of the three horror movies Lionel Atwill did with Fay Wray. Atwill is fantastic here and Wray is, as always, delightful. Nice support from Frank McHugh, Gavin Gordon, and Edwin Maxwell, among others. The scene stealer of the movie is Glenda Farrell as the fast-talking reporter heroine. She really has fun with the part. A few years later she would star in the Torchy Blane series and play a character very similar to the one she plays here.It's a good-looking movie, filmed in two-color Technicolor with nice atmospheric direction from Curtiz. The sets are great, especially Atwill's art deco laboratory. The makeup effects are terrific. It's a juicy Pre-Coder, as evidenced by the gruesome plot and the junkie character played by Arthur Edmund Carewe. Some viewers might be put off by the fact that a large chunk of the middle of the picture is more like a crime story/newspaper movie but I was always entertained, particularly by the back & forth between Farrell and McHugh. So it's not a straight horror movie from beginning to end but, so what, it's still a great film and worth a look. Remade in the '50s as House of Wax with Vincent Price. That version is more well-known than this one but I like rewatching this one more. It's just more fun.", "MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (Warner Brothers, 1933), reunites director Michael Curtiz with his DOCTOR X (First National, 1932) co-stars, Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, in another two-strip Technicolor horror/comedy mystery. A carbon copy of DOCTOR X with a few alterations and improvements thrown in, it ranks the finest and most noteworthy of the Atwill-Fay collaborations (1933's THE VAMPIRE BAT for Majestic was their second), as well as the most eerie and mysterious of them all. While Atwill and Wray had equal status in their initial two outings, Atwill this time dominates while Wray, interestingly, has little to do, not making her screen presence until 30 minutes from the opening titles. She's gone for long stretches and is not visible in the fade-out while Glenda Farrell, the secondary female character, comes close to being the lead, or so it appears. Regardless of Wray's limitations, her character is quite crucial to the story and to Atwill's mentally unbalanced character.Opening with a prologue set in 1921 London introduces Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill) as a brilliant sculptor of wax figures of noteworthy figures as Joan of Arc, Jack the Ripper, Disraeli, and his most favorite, Marie Antoinette, hoping for his museum to become successful once it opens to the public. Because he's invested more money than anticipated, Joe Worth (Edwin Maxwell), his partner whom he owes back salary, comes upon a plan to get back some of his investment by burning down the museum and collect on the fire insurance. A fight ensues between the two partners, with Worth breaking away, locking Igor inside the museum surrounded by flames where he's left to burn along with his wax figures. Move forward, New Year's Eve, 1933, in New York City. Ivan, who has survived the burning flames, is wheelchair bound. Unable to recreate his wax figures due to his severely burned hands, he hires assistants, Ralph (Allen Vincent); D'Arcy (Arthur Edmund Carewe) and Hugo (Matthew Betz) to sculpt wax figures for him under his supervision. Successfully reproducing his original creations, Igor is unable to do the same with Marie Antoinette, that is, until he meets her replica, Charlotte Duncan (Fay Wray), Ralph's fianc\u00e9e. In the meantime, a series of murders have taken place with bodies mysteriously disappearing from the morgue from some figure in a cloak. Millionaire playboy Harold Ritten (Gavin Gordon), who happened to be with Joan Gale on the night of her murder, is suspected and jailed. Florence Parks (Glenda Farrell), Charlotte's roommate and gal reporter for the New York Express, is assigned by her editor (Frank McHugh) to investigate. Following her interview with Harold leading to her constant snooping around Igor's 14th Street wax museum, she discovers something quite startling in connection to the murder, hence \"the mystery of the wax museum.\"If the story sounds at all familiar, it was reworked more famously as HOUSE OF WAX (Warners, 1954) starring Vincent Price in the Atwill role. Due to the popularity of the remake, the original from which it was based, was virtually unknown, especially since no prints of MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM have survived. Fortunately, an original print was discovered, according to sources, in Jack L. Warner's private vault around the late 1960s. WAX MUSEUM finally turned up on commercial television, notably on New York City's WPIX, Channel 11's \"Chiller Theater\" on February 10, 1973, where it broadcast annually until 1978, only in black and white format only. It would be another decade before two-strip Technicolor prints surfaced and distributed on home video and DVD, with broadcasts on Turner Network Television (1988-1993) and finally Turner Classic Movies (1994-present).With Glenda Farrell assuming the wisecracking reporter role Lee Tracy enacted in DOCTOR X, her performance in this venture seems right and warranted, improving over Tracy's lackluster buffoonery. Even if Farrell's character disappoints, the script does not and neither does Atwill. Who could forget his key scenes as the bearded Igor conversing with his favorite wax figure of Marie Antoinette, and his outlook as he witnesses the melting of his \"children\" in a blazing fire (very realistically done and effective in color), along with his unforgettable confrontation with the screaming Wray as he offers her \"eternal life\" in the manner that would have done 1925s \"Phantom of the Opera\" star Lon Chaney proud had he lived to see this.In some ways, THE MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM is perfect, in others it's not, but must have been good enough to acquire a remake, find the missing negative for the original and have it displayed as one of the finer horror classics to come out from the 1930s. (**1/2)", "One of the early two strip color features was this horror classic Mystery Of The Wax Museum. This film starts with a prologue where Lionel Atwill gets into a fight with his partner in Paris and the Wax Museum they own there burns down with both sustaining injuries. Like the Phantom Of The Opera Atwill like Lon Chaney and later Claude Rains and Herbert Lom regards his wax statues as a father does a child.Fast forward to twelve years later where after instructing people to work as he did, he's ready to open shop again in New York. But something about Atwill's operation attracts reporter Glenda Farrell who apparently was doing a dress rehearsal for her later Torchy Blane series. Let's say his figures are way too realistic.Fay Wray who is Farrell's friend is put in as much in harm's way as she was with that giant ape on top of the Empire State Building that same year. And speaking of the Phantom Of The Opera the ending of this film was taken right from said source.Atwill like Claude Rains gives a marvelous performance of a man demented by tragedy. He really dominates the scenes he's in. Farrell and Joan Blondell in their time at Warner Brothers played a lot of the same roles. You could have cast Blondell here and it wouldn't be noticed. Fay Wray did well by her part.But despite all in watching Mystery Of The Wax Museum I saw something I never thought I would see in a film. Frank McHugh who plays Farrell's editor actually gets the girl in a film.Now that alone is worth seeing Mystery Of The Wax Museum.", "London after dark. A gallery of life-like wax figures. An argument, a fight & a fire. A man left to die in the flames. And as they melt, the figures seem to weep at their own destruction.So starts MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, credited as the first horror film with a modern urban setting - New York City. Glenda Farrell is the brash, blonde reporter trying to help her pal Fay Wray discover the secrets of a new wax museum just about to open, and those of its director Lionel Atwill, who is confined to a wheelchair due to a past accident. Murder & mayhem & wax-covered flesh will all figure into the plot before the mystery is solved.This was one of Atwill's best roles, playing an artist driven to dementia by the destruction of the only things he ever really loved. His is a very special, nuanced performance.Like DOCTOR X the year before, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM benefits from wonderful Anton Grot sets (especially the wax bath) and from having been filmed in early two-strip Technicolor, which makes all the ghastly figures seem to come alive..."
